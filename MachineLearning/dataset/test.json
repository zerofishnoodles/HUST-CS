[{"content": "Estamos em guerra. Estamos todos em choque. O caso não é para menos. Ninguém, sobretudo no mundo ocidental, viveu uma situação destas. Já escrevi aqui muitas vezes, que vivemos num mundo global. Ora, nesta aldeia global que nos permite estar rapidamente ligados com a Austrália ou o Canadá, que nos permite fazer negócios com qualquer ponto do globo, também nos devolve como é este vírus cuja propagação começou na China. Sim, isto também é a globalização.\nEstamos a enfrentar uma crise sem precedentes, pois as epidemias mais recentes permaneceram mais geograficamente concentradas. A crise de 2008, por exemplo, não foi nem de perto, nem de longe, similar a esta. Foi sobretudo financeira, e económica. Tivemos consequências sociais, mas sem os problemas de saúde pública que estamos a presenciar e que teremos pela frente.\nNão é por acaso que no Natal a mensagem mais comum é o desejo de saúde. É que esse bem, essa dádiva, é, sem sombra de dúvida, o maior que poderemos ter. Até para fazer face às crises financeiras e económicas. Estamos numa fase, em que as circunstâncias e os riscos, quase nos levam a dizer: que se lixe a economia, que se lixe a ortodoxia alheada de certos decisores. Que se lixe mesmo. Penso que não há negócio algum que seja superior ao valor da vida humana. Só que não podemos lixar a economia. Temos hoje que cuidar de todos para depois restaurar a economia.\nVamos ser claros. Ninguém tem condições para fazer face, por si só, a uma pandemia destas. Não há recursos. Não há meios. Portugal não é uma excepção. E Portugal já tinha, antes do Covid-19, muitos problemas no nosso Serviço Nacional de Saúde (SNS). Não estamos preparados, nem pouco mais ou menos para testar o pico de resposta do SNS, os ventiladores, as máquinas, não se multiplicam, muito menos os profissionais de saúde, cujos ombros carregarão pesos que testarão os seus limites, como a China e a Itália já nos mostraram.\nTodavia, não estarmos preparados não pode significar ficar de braços cruzados, à espera do perigo. Não podemos. Para períodos excepcionais, as respostas devem ser excepcionais. Sim, precisamos de estar em casa. Sim, precisamos de perceber que isto não está para brincadeiras, para ir à praia ou simplesmente ignorar a gravidade do problema da facilidade de contágio. Na vida em sociedade, a inconsciência de uns pode, em sentido literal, fazer perigar a vida dos outros, sobretudo a dos mais vulneráveis.\nPor isso precisamos de liderança forte e autoridade. Não podemos brincar aos governantes, não basta fazer pose de estadista. Precisamos de gente com fibra e pulso para tomar decisões difíceis, impopulares, mas necessárias. Não precisamos de politiquices. Não podemos ficar reféns de pareceres aparentemente técnicos, pois nestas medidas de saúde pública o técnico torna-se inseparável do político. Itália é um exemplo dramático. Está ali. Para observarmos, aprendermos e corrigirmos respostas.\nE este é também um momento definidor. Onde está a União Europeia? Que resposta dá? Anos e anos de construção europeia, de instituições burocráticas e quando temos um problema global, é cada um por si. É isto que se sente, muito pouca cooperação e solidariedade. E isto terá consequências económicas e políticas lá mais à frente. Mas lá à frente queremos estar todos vivos. Vivos também para avaliar as respostas que os nossos decisores políticos nos deram, chegará esse tempo para fazer o balanço, para fazer as avaliações, mas depois do fogo se tornar cinzas. Vivos para reconstruir um mundo que está todo ligado e que nos demonstra que não há ninguém imune numa situação destas. Ricos e pobres, Ocidente e Oriente. Estamos todos no mesmo barco, a humanidade, tal como o planeta onde habitamos, é um só.\nPenso que não há maior medo que o da morte ou de ver os nossos perecer. E deve ser esse o nosso foco. Depois, com saúde, com todos doentes tratados, devemos reconstruir uma economia global. Ainda não conseguimos contabilizar os estragos de duas semanas em casa, ainda para mais quando nem sabemos se vão ser apenas 15 dias ou mais. Será dramático para o comércio, restauração, hotelaria e outros serviços. Sim. Infelizmente será. O sector do turismo está de rastos com os cancelamentos. Muitas fábricas vão ter de parar ou laborar bastante abaixo da sua capacidade. Mas precisamos com urgência de estancar este bicho para voltarmos às esplanadas, aos restaurantes, aos centros comerciais e às praias. Sem vacina, sem anti-vírus eficazes na eliminação do COVID-19 restam-nos, como lhes chamou o epidemiologista Peter Piot (um dos investigadores que descobriu o Ébola), “métodos medievais de contenção: isolamento, quarentena e mapeamento de contactos”.\nQue se lixe a economia, a segurança das pessoas está primeiro. É preciso coragem.\n"}, {"content": "POLL-Chinese economy clobbered by coronavirus but set to recover soon. (Reuters) - The coronavirus-hit Chinese economy will grow at its slowest rate since the financial crisis in the current quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained.\nA Feb. 7-13 Reuters poll of 40 economists based in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, as well as Europe and the United States, predicted China’s annual economic growth in the first quarter of 2020 to slump to 4.5% from 6.0% in the previous quarter.\nThat drop was expected to drag down the full-year growth rate in 2020 to 5.5% from 6.1% in 2019, its weakest since at least 1990 when comparable records began.\nHowever, economists were optimistic the economy would bounce back as soon as the second quarter, with growth then forecast to recover to a median 5.7%, according to the poll.\nThat figure was pushed higher by several optimistic forecasts from economists based in mainland China. The range was 2.9%-6.5%.\nThe coronavirus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan - a nerve center in the global supply chain with a population of just under 11 million - and so far has claimed over 1,300 lives in China. That outstrips fatalities from the SARS outbreak in 2002-03 which killed 774 people worldwide.\n“Nobody knows the damage China’s virus containment efforts will have on growth, and we probably never will for sure, given the opacity of the statistics. We reckon true GDP growth will fall below 2% in Q1, from 4.0% in Q4, which already was substantially lower than the official 6.0%,” said Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon in London.\n“The lost production probably will be made up over the remainder of this year. But some service sector activity simply will be lost... people aren’t going to get their hair cut twice because they missed getting it cut in Q1, or buy two coffees to make up for missed consumption.”\n(Reuters poll graphic on coronavirus impact on the Chinese economy - here)\nThe enforced shutdown started during the Lunar New Year - usually the busiest time for most services businesses and according to most economists will accelerate an already-noticeable downturn before the outbreak.\nWhen asked to comment on what would happen to the economy if Chinese authorities failed to contain the virus from spreading rapidly, some mainland economists were reluctant to respond.\nGrowth was expected to slow to 3.5% in the first quarter in a worst-case scenario, according to a median from 15 economists in response to a separate question, with forecasts ranging between zero and 5.5%.\n“I think the virus will be under control by April. However, in the worst-case scenario, growth may fall to 2-3% in the first quarter and to 5% in (full-year) 2020,” said Bingnan Ye, senior macroeconomic analyst at Bank of China International in Beijing.\nTheir 2020 forecast matched the median worst-case outcome and lined up with the Chinese government’s forecast for the full-year economic growth rate to fall as much as 1 percentage point in 2020.\n“We do not expect a speedy recovery for the economy, even in the unlikely event that there are no new confirmed cases. After the coronavirus has been contained, it may still take four quarters to see a full recovery,” said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong.\n“Compared to 2003’s SARS, this is a lot more damaging.”\nSince then, China’s economic composition has changed significantly to become a more consumption and service-driven economy from being the world’s factory before.\nChina’s share of the global economy has quadrupled to 16% since the SARS outbreak, so any major disruption to economic activity is likely to have a bigger impact on the world economy now.\n“Every day is a deadline in February as Wuhan coronavirus data roll in,” noted Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG, the most accurate forecaster for Asian currencies in 2019. “For the yuan, the overall depreciation story continues.”\n(Reuters poll graphic on China economic outlook - here)\n"}, {"content": "Coronavírus.

Over 6,000 people have died globally since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. More than 1,62,000 have been infected by Covid-19. What started in China, soon spread across France, the US, Spain, Italy, South Korea and now India.\nIndia, so far, has officially reported 110 cases and two deaths, according to the Ministry of Health. More cases are emerging every day even as states continue to issue advisories on social distancing.\nThe government has put in place stringent measures to curb the spread of the virus. A mandatory quarantine of 14 days has been initiated for all international travellers arriving in the country.\nFrom thermal screenings at major entry-exit points to sanitisation of public places, the Indian government has put its best foot forward in battling the pandemic which has led to significant panic among Indians.\nSelf-discipline is the best cure\nHowever, more than scrutinising the steps taken by the government, the utmost requirement at the moment is self-discipline.\nWith the threat of the rapidly spreading virus looming large over India due to its billion-plus population, it is important to understand the depravity that could be if the spread is not limited in the initial days.\nItaly is the best example to map how rapidly the virus can spread and why it is absolutely essential to impose self-restrictions at an early stage, and not wait for the disaster to strike.\nThe country recorded 368 more deaths from the coronavirus outbreak on Sunday, its biggest single-day rise, amid growing concern about the ability of its strained health system to cope with the relentless increase in new cases. With 24,747 cases and 1,809 deaths by Sunday - a rise of 368 or 25 per cent in the death toll in just 24 hours - Italy's experience has offered an alarming example for other European countries. And, Indians should take note.\nThe daily rise in cases around the globe, especially in countries like Italy -- with a small population of 60 million people -- is alarming. If the virus spreads with such aggressiveness in India, it could result in severe consequences even after the virus fades away.\nIn Italy, hospitals are also unable to cope with such high-frequency rise on a daily basis. Roberta Re, a nurse at Piacenza hospital in Emilia-Romagna called the situation 'war-like', as reported by The Guardian.\n\"It's an experience I would compare to a world war, but it's a war that isn't fightable with traditional arms - as we don't yet know who the enemy is and so it's difficult to fight. The only weapon we do have to avoid things getting even worse is to stay at home and to respect the rules, to do what they did in China, as this is paying off,\" she said.\nPrecaution, not panic\nWith an abundance of global examples that show the severe spread of Covid-19, it can be deduced that most infections spread through lack of individual restrictions at an initial stage. And as the situation aggravated with rising cases in a country or one particular area, the excessive panic was witnessed.\nThis panic, if substituted by precautions at early stages, could help India avoid the health crisis of a much larger magnitude. However, the government alone would not be able to help limit the virus; all citizens must also act responsibly and take the outbreak seriously.\nSocial media chatter over the past few months since the outbreak has often misled people, as some took it lightly and others panicked to insanity. However, doctors advised none of the above. Instead, they asked people to be prepared with some basic but necessary precautions. Social distancing, however, is the most important one.\nThree ways that you can help\n1) Doctors have asked people to stay home if they absolutely do not have to go out.\n2) Medical experts have also asked people to avoid any kind of large gatherings.\n3) Take care of hygiene, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your face\nThese are a few simple steps you can take to support the government in limiting the spread of Covid-19. While not much is known about this virus, doctors, have asked people to follow these important steps at the moment to delay the spread of the virus. But even if you test positive, there is no need to suppress your travel history or run away.\nThe quarantine process is not only for the recovery of an infected person but it is also for the safety of other people in the country. Going by the rate of spread in Italy, Iran, and China, any person with symptoms coming in contact with other people could prove deadly as the virus would keep multiplying. Even if it does not affect an individual carrying it, doctors have clearly mentioned that its spread could be fatal for older people with a weak immune system.\nFor instance, one of the first cases in Uttar Pradesh's Noida which led to an initial shut down of two schools and a five-star hotel, was from a man who returned from Italy and kept his travel history suppressed. He then kept on with his usual social life, exposing others to the danger.\nThere are many other reports in India about suspected people running away in fear that they would be kept in isolation in the quarantine facility. But people have to realise that the process will help in containing the spread of the virus to a great extent.\nIndia is still in the initial stages with 110 official confirmed cases, and so far, it has managed to keep the death toll much lower than the other countries in the third week of the outbreak. And, by imposing self-restrictions, individuals can help the government in flattening the curve further.\nPeople on social media, especially, the young batch who are yet to grasp the seriousness of the issue, need to be more self vigilant. The basics include - doctor visit for 'flu-like symptoms', avoiding crowded places and social gathering until absolutely necessary, restricting movement, opting for work-from-home. It is important to realise that every country initially had a mere number of cases, but within days it rose massively.\nDesperate times call for desperate measures, and at this hour, more than scrutinising the steps taken by the government, it is imperative to focus on personal hygiene and self-discipline.\n"}, {"content": "Fake news alert: Coronavirus will not invade your body within 10 minutes if you do not quench your thirst.

NEW YORK: Drug manufacturers racing to find a vaccine or effective treatment for the deadly new coronavirus in China cautioned that they have a long way to go. \n That runs counter to reports of a supposed \"breakthrough\" that on Wednesday (Feb 5) boosted financial markets and spurred optimism not necessarily backed by reality. \n At least a dozen drugmakers are working on vaccines or antivirals and other treatments to help those infected with the fast-spreading contagion. \n Investment costs for vaccines could run as high as US$800 million in a process that, even if accelerated, will likely take more than a year until approval, according to executives from companies involved in the effort. \n  \n \"It will take at least 12 to 18 months, which means in the acute situation we are in now - at least in China - that will not create a benefit,\" said Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GlaxoSmithKline's vaccine unit. GSK is working with developers by providing a technology that could make their vaccines more potent. \n The virus, which emerged in December in China, has killed nearly 500 people and shows no sign of abating, with thousands of new cases reported each day, mostly in central China's Hubei province. But its spread to some 27 countries and regions has caused global alarm. \n To be sure, companies developing treatments for patients who are already sick may be able to get a drug approved faster than a vaccine that would be given to healthy people. Even so, logistical and regulatory challenges remain, according to two executives at Gilead Sciences Inc, which is working on an experimental antiviral treatment. \n \"There is a distinction there between a therapeutic and a vaccine. Having said that, I think it is true that this won't be super fast and it will involve us investing at risk right now,\" said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey. \n Clinical trials for treatments can be smaller and of shorter duration than for vaccines, Parsey acknowledged. \n Challenges in making sure therapies are effective and then scaling up production still remain. Gilead has only a limited supply of its remdesivir, which will be tested against the coronavirus after previously failing in trials as a treatment for Ebola. \n 'LOOKING FOR A MAGIC BULLET' \n Dr Thomas Frieden, who was director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention during the also deadly MERS outbreak, said the benefit of antiviral treatments for such emergencies in the past has been modest. \n What worked with MERS and SARS, for example, was better infection control in healthcare facilities, he said of two other types of coronaviruses that also caused global alarm. \n \"It doesn't mean we shouldn't try, but we're often looking for a magic bullet and the bright shiny object. Sometimes we need to just have the basics,\" Frieden said. \n A Chinese TV report on Wednesday said that a research team at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus, while researchers in the UK told Sky News separately they had made a \"significant breakthrough\" in finding a vaccine. \n Reuters could not independently verify the reports, but several traders cited them for sharp upticks in global stock markets. \n \"There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV,\" said World Health Organisation spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, using the current designation for the new coronavirus, when asked about reports of \"drug breakthroughs.\" \n Health officials in the United States and China have set ambitious goals for getting a vaccine to initial human testing within the next few months. \n Newer vaccine platforms, such as one developed by Moderna Inc, allow scientists to create a potential vaccine in record time just based on knowing the genetic code of the novel coronavirus. With the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development without needing a sample of the virus. \n Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is using Moderna's platform, said the agency is on the fastest pace ever to develop a vaccine candidate. \n He hopes to have a vaccine available for initial safety testing within two and a half to three months from the time scientists determined the genetic sequence of the virus. \n Novavax Inc research chief Gregory Glenn told Reuters his company has taken vaccines from discovery to clinical testing in 90 days and believes it could do something similar for the new coronavirus. \n But to move vaccine candidates from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles, according to health experts and executives for drugmakers working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. \n In addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks, there are regulatory hurdles such as conducting large clinical trials to make sure a vaccine not only confers immunity to the virus but is safe for use in the general population. \n \"The earliest you could even know if it's going to work is a year,\" Fauci said. \n Whether even a highly effective vaccine will prove profitable for companies is another big question. \n \"The outbreak could be abating by the time a vaccine is deemed safe,\" Karen Andersen, who follows biotech companies for Morningstar, said in a research note. \n The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has raised around US$800 million from donors to aid in preventing pandemic diseases and has allocated some of those funds to biotechs, including Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, Moderna Inc and CureVac, which are working on coronavirus vaccines. \n \"We stepped into this with no economic expectation,\" said Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson's chief scientific officer. \"We'll see whether in the end it gives a reward.\" \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram \n "}, {"content": "Coronavirus: India Inc will shiver if China can't contain outbreak . Growing insecurity over the coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic in China may have a sharp impact on India's already-strained economy as industries fear that the outbreak could cripple their production activities.\nA recent report by Ind-RA said efforts to contain the virus outbreak within next three to four months will be critical as it would determine the fate of many industries around the globe, including in India.\nIf the virus is contained within the aforesaid time period, the impact on businesses in India and elsewhere will not be overgenerous, the report said.\nBut if no positive result comes within a few months, multiple Indian sectors could face major supply-side disturbances, triggering a delay in key manufacturing activities.\nThe Ind-Ra report goes on to highlight that the economic impact could be worse than what was seen during the SARS outbreak in 2003. At that time, the world was less dependent on China, now considered the biggest world's biggest manufacturing hub with a substantial contribution to the global GDP.\nChina now contributes to over one-sixth or over 15 per cent of the world's GDP and any deceleration in manufacturing activity could significantly impact worldwide growth.\nCommenting on the situation, Sunil Damania, CIO, MarketsMojo.com, said, \"For some reason, if China is unable to control it for six months, the impacts would be severe.\"\n\"It's very difficult to quantify as there are many moving parts. But it would have a significant impact and has the potential to drag down the world's GDP growth rate by at least 20 basis points for CY2020,\" he added.\nIMPACT ON INDIA\nThe Indian economy is already battling many headwinds including inflation, slow demand, and lower-income, which resulted in a sharp fall in GDP growth in 2019. Economic woes could amplify as many of the country's key sectors rely heavily on components or parts manufactured in China.\nWhile the government predicted India's growth for the next fiscal at 6.5 per cent, delay in supply of key essential commodities from China for a prolonged period could spill water on that optimistic forecast.\nSome sectors such as automobiles, consumer electronics, drugs and pharmaceuticals -- all of which contribute significantly to the country's GDP -- will bear the brunt of the supply curbs. Interlinked sectors will also suffer as a result.\n\"If the outbreak continues for longer than anticipated then the risk will not be restricted to a few sectors, but it can hurt the overall economy,\" Damania said.\nOver the past few weeks, concerned voices from the industry have discussed the issue in detail.\nSome industry experts said trade has already been mildly affected in India as supply chain issues start cropping up. The impact will start showing when firms run out of inventory, they said.\nLOWER JOBS, INFLATION AND MORE\nA delay in the supply of inventory would not only lead to lower production but will also lower sales volume. It could also lead to job cuts and higher inflation.\nFor instance, many electronic goods and phone manufacturers have already started facing the effects of supply slowdown as companies in China failed to restart key manufacturing activities. Major smartphone sellers like Xiaomi hinted at possible rise in prices as supplies of key components are already facing delays.\nA host of Indian smartphone manufacturers, who dearly depend on China for key components, are already indicating that their productions will fall if the supply disruptions continue. It could be a huge blow to India, which is the second-largest smartphone market in the world.\nSome analysts are expecting a drop in production and sales of consumer durables and smartphones while others fear that prices could go up in a situation where there is high demand but lack of supply.\nConsumer durables like television, washing machines and air conditioners -- all of which need critical components manufactured in China -- may also see a drop in sales due to lack of supply.\nWhat's worse is the fact that it could lead to higher inflationary pressure on India as China vendors have hiked prices of critical components amid the shortage. Higher inflation in times of slow growth could be disastrous for India and could severely disrupt plans to revive the economy.\nLike smartphones, automobile manufacturers also import a host of parts and essential components from China. It may be noted that more than 60 per cent of Chinese auto assembly production units have been directly affected by the coronavirus epidemic.\nA Boston Consulting Group report said the impact on the Chinese automobile industry will affect many other countries including India. A Fitch report said India's auto production activity could dip by over 8 per cent in 2020 due to the situation.\n\"China supplies India with between 10-30 per cent of its automotive components and this could be two to three times higher when looking at India's EV segment, which highlights just how exposed India's automobile manufacturing industry is to the slowdown of vehicle Chinese component manufacturing,\" it said.\nBut manufacturers in India have little choice apart from monitoring the situation and hoping for factories in China to fire up their assembly lines. Some Chinese factories reopened this week, but workers are in no position to resume activities with no solution in sight.\nAnother concern that India could face due to the virus outbreak in China is job cuts. With lower scope of production activities, some companies will be forced to lay off contractual labourers.\nThis could have a negative effect on India's declining income levels.\nLower manufacturing and production activity due to the virus outbreak could pull down India's Industrial output, which is also not in good shape. To sum it up, a fall in manufacturing output along with ticking inflation and supply constraints could worsen India's growth outlook further.\nAt the time of writing this article, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak stood at 1,488 with a sharp jump in the number of confirmed cases at over 65,000.\nThe situation in China remains critical with 121 news deaths on Friday while Japan registered its first death, the third fatality outside China.\n"}, {"content": "Suspected coronavirus case in Patna, girl returns from China with symptoms.

SINGAPORE: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that infected more people in China than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 has now spread across the globe. \n While we are learning more about the virus daily, questions are being raised about its rapid spread. One possibility is that this development could be related to climatic conditions. \n CLIMATE, WEATHER AND FLU SEASONALITY \n There is reason to believe that the seasonal pattern of novel coronavirus pneumonia may be similar to that of influenza infection and SARS, and thus cases may sharply fall by May, when temperatures in China warm up. \n In countries with temperate climates such as China and the United States, the flu season usually starts in December with a peak in January or February, after which cases decrease. \n SARS disappeared in the northern summer of 2003 and has not reappeared significantly since. This seasonality of influenza and other respiratory viruses in temperate countries is thought to be related to factors that affect infectiousness (person to person spread) such as the dryness of the air, ambient air temperature and possibly ultraviolet solar radiation. \n Human factors may also contribute to the spread of influenza during the colder winters since more time may be spent indoors, presumably in closer contact with other persons. \n The 2019-nCoV appears to be similar to other respiratory viruses such as influenza or the common cold (rhinovirus), which are spread by large droplets of saliva or phlegm from one person to another (either directly by cough or sneeze) or by contact. That happens when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her nose, mouth or eyes, inadvertently transmitting the virus. \n In fact, studies have shown that these respiratory droplets spread farther when the air is cold and dry. \n Studies done many years ago showed that the “regular” coronavirus (which is one of the causes of the common cold) can survive on surfaces 30 times longer in places with a temperature of 6 degrees Celsius compared to those where the temperature is 20 degrees Celsius and humidity levels are high. \n More recently, scientists from Hong Kong University (HKU) including Professor Malik Peiris and Professor Seto Wing Hong showed that low temperatures and low relative humidity allowed the SARS virus to survive much longer than they would in high temperatures and humidity. \n  \n The HKU team argued that this may be the reason warm and humid Southeast Asian countries did not have SARS outbreaks, unlike Hong Kong and Singapore where in their words, there is “intensive use of air-conditioning”. \n Thus, just as with influenza, the 2019-nCoV may slow down when the sun starts to shine more and the weather warms up in temperate and subtropical countries. \n LESSONS FROM SARS \n The SARS epidemic occurred 17 years ago and, since then, public health institutions, medical and laboratory science professionals, and the infectious diseases community are much better prepared to respond to novel and emerging infections globally. \n The improvements in communications and social media are undeniable. The genetic sequence of this new type of severe pneumonia in Wuhan was shared relatively early. \n This allowed countries all over the world to develop fast and accurate tests: These were not available during the initial weeks of SARS outbreak. \n Then, we had to depend on clinical examinations and contact tracing to determine who really was infected with SARS. Near the end of the epidemic, we were able to test everyone and we found out that we had actually missed a significant number of cases – these were only diagnosed after they had recovered. \n This has been the biggest difference in that now, low-resourced countries like Nepal and Cambodia are able to conduct relatively fast and accurate diagnosis on-site without having to wait for samples to be sent overseas. \n Given that the genetic information about the novel coronavirus was available even before countries had patients with the virus, many labs in advanced countries, including Singapore, are already working on blood tests for rapid detection and studying the immune response to help vaccine development. A trial to test anti-viral treatments has already been initiated in China and is being planned elsewhere. \n CONTACT TRACING AND TRAVEL BANS \n A basic public health approach to any outbreak is the use of contact tracing. \n  \n This means that for any patient who is found to be ill, close family members and other persons that he or she had close contact with during the incubation period will be notified that they were exposed to a sick person and quarantined for a further full incubation period, which for this novel infection is indicated to be 14 days. \n During the Ebola virus outbreak of 2014, this type of contact tracing was done very manually in many settings, although there were a number of mobile applications which were piloted. \n For this 2019 virus infection outbreak, much effort is being placed on high-tech contact tracing. It is too early to tell if this will be more effective, but any method to help contacts monitor themselves during the incubation period and detect symptoms may certainly help to decrease community transmission. \n Public health measures including screening and quarantining are similar to what was done for SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), although there have been broader approaches to travellers without direct contact with infected patients because of the extent of community spread in China. \n Given that we are not sure as to what extent asymptomatic persons can transmit the virus, many countries have decided to close their borders to Chinese nationals, as they cannot rely on temperature screening to detect who is potentially contagious and necessitating quarantine. \n Many countries are also quarantining their own citizens and permanent residents returning from China, in an effort to limit introduction of this virus into the community. \n During SARS, the World Health Organization (WHO) imposed global travel restrictions and advisories. When a travel restriction is in effect, a country may feel the need to quickly get the ban lifted and reduce its aggressive screening and case finding. This may have contributed to the resurgence of SARS in Toronto after the initial period of good control. \n This time round, different countries have introduced their own travel restrictions which are probably more appropriate to the different situations and their relations with China. \n Travel bans are always controversial as they tend to have significant unintended consequences and have to be actually instituted before the virus appears in the country. Otherwise, they are relatively pointless. \n Among the concerns about the travel bans instituted this time during the coronavirus is the fact that we do not know how extensive the spread is from people without symptoms. \n  \n If this is really very widespread, then a blanket travel ban will have limited effects by now as the virus is probably silently spreading among and through most countries. Once there is documented local transmission in a country, as in Germany and the United States, the goal has to be containing the local transmission while at the same time preventing re-introduction of the virus. \n Overall, the key strategy has to be good contact tracing and widespread testing so that every case can be identified, tested and treated. That way the chain of transmission can be broken and the virus stopped in its tracks even before the warm weather kicks in. \n VACCINES AND DRUG TREATMENTS \n Unfortunately, the current way in which drug and vaccine development in modern medicine happens is very much driven by financial considerations. Unlike for example defence or homeland security, the question that always comes up when it comes to treating and preventing human disease is: “Is this financially viable?” \n As SARS disappeared 17 years ago and MERS has only occurred sporadically, primarily in the Middle East, there has been no incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to invest the funds needed to develop appropriate drugs and vaccines. \n All the interest and enthusiasm which came with SARS disappeared when the virus did not reappear after a couple of seasons. Governments had other priorities and most have actually left this part of national security to private industry. \n Hence, if and when the novel coronavirus disappears in May and does not reappear next October or November, we can predict that drug and vaccine development will likely die a natural death. \n That is unfortunately the way of the world and hopefully something can be done to change this. But that will require a massive global mindset change. Given the frequency with which these emerging viral infections occur, the world can ill- afford to continue along this road. \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram \n Assistant Professor Jyoti Somani, Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS and Professor Paul Ananth Tambyah, Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS and President, Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection. \n Editor's Note: A previous headline to this commentary referred to hot and dry climate.

Most people see China being responsible for this global crisis,\" said Mr Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China. \n \"But the generous humanitarian help from China will possibly swing the public opinion in Europe more in favour of China.\" \n "}, {"content": "China reports 17 more cases of new virus strain.

Disposable rubber gloves are indispensable in the global fight against the new coronavirus, yet a month’s lockdown in stricken Malaysia where three of every five gloves are made has upended the supply chain and threatens to hamstring hospitals worldwide.\nThe world’s biggest maker of medical gloves by volume, Top Glove Corp Bhd (TPGC.KL), has the capacity to make 200 million gloves a day, but a supplier shutdown has left it with only two weeks’ worth of boxes to ship them in, its founder told Reuters.\nWe can’t get our gloves to hospitals without cartons, Executive Chairman Lim Wee Chai said in an interview. Hospitals need our gloves. We can’t just supply 50% of their requirement.\nThe virus, which emerged in China at the end of last year, has left Malaysia with the highest number of infections in Southeast Asia at nearly 1,800 cases, with 17 deaths. To halt transmission, the government has ordered people to stay home from March 18 to April 14.\nGlove makers and others eligible for exemption can operate half-staffed provided they meet strict safety conditions. Still, the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) said it was lobbying almost every hour to return the industry to full strength to minimize risk to the global fight.\nWe’re shut down, said Evonna Lim, managing director at packaging supplier Etheos Imprint Technology. We fall under an exempted category but still need approval.\nDr Celine Gounder, an infectious diseases specialist at the New York University School of Medicine, said she was using up to six times as many gloves as normal each day due to the number of patients with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\nIf we get to the point where there is a shortage of gloves, that’s going to be a huge problem because then we cannot draw blood safely, we cannot do many medical procedures safely.\nGLOBAL CALL\nWith glove supplies dwindling, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on its website this month said here some gloves could be used beyond their designated shelf life. On Tuesday, the United States lifted a ban on imports from Malaysian glove maker WRP Asia Pacific who it had previously accused of using forced labor.\nBritain’s Department of Health & Social Care has urged Malaysian authorities to prioritize the production and shipment of gloves that are of utmost criticality for fighting COVID-19, showed a letter dated March 20 to glove maker Supermax Corp (SUPM.KL) and shared with Reuters.\nMARGMA is considering rationing due to the extremely high demand, its president Denis Low said. You can produce as many gloves as you can but then there’s nothing to pack them into.\nUnder normal circumstances, Top Glove can meet less than 40% of its own packaging needs. For the remainder, it said just 23% of suppliers have gained approval to operate at half strength.\nWe are lobbying almost every hour, we are putting in a lot of letters to the ministry, said Low. We are lobbying hard for the chemical suppliers and we want to ensure that the printers are also being given approval and any other supporting services, even transportation.\nMalaysia’s Ministry of International Trade and Industry on Tuesday said it had received masses of applications to operate through the lockdown, and that it was seeking cooperation from industries to give way to those producing essential goods.\nAUTOMATION\nDeveloped economies are home to only a fifth of the world’s population yet account for nearly 70% medical glove demand due to stringent medical standards. At 150, U.S. glove consumption per-capita is 20 times that of China, latest MARGMA data showed.\nMARGMA expects demand to jump 16% to 345 billion gloves this year, with Malaysia’s market share rising two percentage points to 65%. Thailand usually follows at about 18% and China at 9%.\nTop Glove said orders have doubled since February and it sees sales rising by a fifth in the next six months. Its stock, with a market value of about $3.5 billion, has risen by a third this year versus a fall of 16% in the wider market.\nThe company, with customers in 195 economies, registered the highest net money inflow last week among listed Malaysian firms, along with peer Hartalega Holdings Bhd (HTHB.KL), showed MIDF Research data. Other glove makers include Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd (KRIB.KL) and Careplus Group Bhd (CARE.KL).\nWe are fortunate enough to be in essential goods, said Lim. These few months and at least the next six months will be an all-time high in terms of sales volume, revenue and profit.\nWith more than 80% of its 44 factories worldwide automated, Top Glove itself is less impacted by the lockdown than its more labor-intensive domestic suppliers. Packaging woes aside, however, ramping up production could turn under-supply into over-supply when the coronavirus outbreak finally subsides.\nThis outbreak will create awareness and make humankind healthier, said Lim. People will pay more attention, they will invest more, they will buy more so demand will be more.\n"}, {"content": "FOREX-Yen steadies on virus anxiety, euro hit by weak growth outlook. * Graphic: World FX rates in 2020 tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\n* China virus uncertainty weighs on markets\n* Euro takes a hit before GDP data\n* Sterling sees positives in cabinet reshuffle\nBy Stanley White\nTOKYO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen held onto gains against the dollar on Friday, as fresh doubts about the scale of the coronavirus outbreak supported demand for safe-haven currencies.\nThe Chinese yuan nursed losses as the flu-like virus, which emerged late last year in China’s central Hubei province, slammed the brakes on consumer spending and manufacturing.\nThe euro languished at multi-year lows versus the dollar and the Swiss franc as investors grow more pessimistic about the outlook in the euro zone before the release of gross domestic product data later on Friday.\nIn contrast, the pound rode a wave of optimism into Asia on Friday due to hopes that a British cabinet reshuffle will lead to more expansionary fiscal policy to support growth.\nOfficials in Hubei stunned financial markets on Thursday by announcing a sharp increase in new infections and deaths from the coronavirus, reflecting the adoption of a new method to diagnose the illness.\nUncertainty about the real extent of the epidemic is likely to discourage investors from taking on excessive risk until there is sufficient evidence that its spread has slowed.\n“There is a return of risk aversion, so yen and other safe-haven assets have risen, but reaction so far has been temporary and limited,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.\n“The change of reporting standards in China is a concern.

DAEGU/SEOUL, South Korea (Reuters) - An So-young had a gut feeling that the 31st person in South Korea to test positive for the coronavirus might be a member of the controversial religious sect she quit four years ago.\nThe person, dubbed “Patient 31,” was the first of an explosive wave of cases that made South Korea’s outbreak the largest outside of China. What caught An’s attention was how health authorities were struggling to track the woman’s movements before she was tested.\n“That’s their culture, they have to hide their movements, and that’s why I guessed she was with Shincheonji,” An, 27, said in an interview, referring to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.\nPatient 31 attended services at the church’s branch in the southeastern city of Daegu this month, staying for two hours each time, before testing positive on Feb. 18.\nThe South Korean disease control chief Jeong Eun-kyeong said the church’s services, where thousands of people sit on the floor, shoulder-to-shoulder, for hours, could have contributed to the surges.\n“You would be 5 centimeters away from the person who sits next to you, and have to say ‘Amen’ after every sentence the pastor speaks - it’s the best environment for the virus to spread,” said An, who is now a theology student.\nIn a media interview, Patient 31 said she did not refuse to be tested. But health authorities said she sought care at a traditional medicine hospital in Daegu after a minor car accident, where a medical worker who treated her later tested positive for the virus. While running a fever, she went to a buffet at a hotel and the church services.\nShincheonji is in the biggest crisis in its 36-year history, as hundreds of members have tested positive for the virus, SARS-CoV-2. All of its 210,000 known followers are being tested amid unprecedented scrutiny from authorities and the public.\nAfter initial resistance, the church released the addresses of 1,100 facilities around the country - 82 churches and 1,018 “affiliates,” - and asked the public to avoid making “groundless criticism.” It was the “biggest victim of the virus,” it said.\nCalls by Reuters to the church’s headquarters seeking comment went unanswered.\nDuring a visit to the Daegu branch on Friday, a man who identified himself as a member said he was the only one there and told Reuters that “all of our 9,000 members are taking self-quarantine measures in compliance with the government instruction.” He said the building was disinfected twice last week.\nInteractive graphic about the spread of coronavirus inside South Korea: here\nSouth Korea reported 334 new cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, bringing the national tally to 1,595. More than 1,000 are from Daegu, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), and nearly 600 are directly linked to Shincheonji’s branch there.\nKCDC said that it is still investigating the exact origin of the outbreak, but that five or six other members of the church were infected together with Patient 31.\nThe church had a presence in Wuhan, the center of the virus in China, according to the KCDC, though it is unclear whether that played a role.\nAlso known as the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, the church was founded and is headed by self-proclaimed messiah Lee Man-hee.\n“This disease case is the devil’s deed to stop the rapid growth of Shincheonji,” Lee said in a message on Friday on an internal app used by members.\nBut its secretive practices and often-aggressive recruitment tactics have made the church a controversial presence in South Korea’s religious community.\nNew members are forced to leave home and live in dormitories as part of initiation. Many break ties with their family and begin aggressively recruiting new members, An said.\nAccording to its website, followers must undergo six months of classes and complete a demanding written exam before “graduating” and joining the church.\nThe church has denied previous reports by Christian news organizations describing it as a “brainwashing cult”, calling those accusations “blatant lies” and a plot to rein in its expansion.\nAll members work as “harvesters” tasked with courting new followers from other churches, dubbed “harvest fields”, former members said.\n“It may appear Christian, but is actually completely different. They revere founder Lee Man-hee as a saviour, like Jesus,” said Lee Duck-sure, a Christian pastor who runs a counseling center in Seoul for former members of Shincheonji.\nSouth Koreans vented anger after an official at a Daegu public health center that carries out virus tests continued to work even after he was told to get tested. He revealed he was a member of the Daegu Shincheonji church only after the test showed he was infected, Daegu officials said.\nBut health officials and experts cautioned the blame should not be focused on the church and its believers, saying they were also victims.\nKCDC is also looking into links between the church and a hospital in nearby Cheongdo County, which reported the second-highest number of patients in the country with more than 110.\nThe county is a holy site for Shincheonji believers as the birthplace of Lee, and recently a funeral for his older brother was held at that hospital.\nOn a recent visit, the Daegu church was shuttered and silent, surrounded by empty streets and closed stores. Someone had thrown eggs at the front gate of the building.\nSon, who did not want to give her full name and lives in the neighborhood, said many believers, especially young women, have moved to live near the church, and several restaurants are run by members.\nDoo Song-Ja, 64, said she had not heard from her daughter since 2015, when she joined the church.\n“I’m so worried because so many Shincheonji followers are testing positive but I don’t know where she is,” said Doo, who said her 33-year-old daughter had sued her for “forcible confinement” for trying to keep her home. “I just hope she is OK.”\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: China keeps lending rate unchanged despite urgent stimulus need .

Contudo, vincou, as autoridades mantêm contacto com estas pessoas para se assegurem que não têm sintomas.\n\"Até agora, o protocolo português é assim e segue orientações da Organização Mundial da Saúde\", rematou.\nPortugal já fez acionar os dispositivos de saúde pública devido ao coronavírus proveniente da China e tem em alerta o Hospital de São João, no Porto, o Curry Cabral e Estefânia, em Lisboa.\nEm Portugal foram ativados os protocolos estabelecidos para situações do género, reforçando no Serviço Nacional de Saúde a linha Saúde 24, através do número 800242424, e a linha de apoio médico, para triagem e evitar que em caso de eventual contágio as pessoas não encham os centros de saúde e as urgências dos hospitais.\nAlguns países, como Estados Unidos, Japão, França, Alemanha e Portugal, estão a preparar com as autoridades chinesas a retirada dos seus cidadãos de Wuhan, onde também se encontram duas dezenas de portugueses.\nO Governo português já anunciou que quer retirar por via aérea os portugueses retidos em Wuhan.\nA China elevou para 106 mortos e mais de 4.000 infetados o balanço do novo coronavírus detetado no final do ano em Wuhan, capital da província de Hubei (centro).\nAs pessoas infetadas podem transmitir a doença durante o período de incubação, que demora entre um dia e duas semanas, sem que o vírus seja detetado."}, {"content": "canada to stop people with covid-19 symptoms boarding domestic flights, trains. WINNIPEG, Manitoba - Canada will not allow anyone displaying symptoms of the COVID-19 respiratory illness to board domestic flights or inter-city passenger trains, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday, the latest travel restriction aimed at curbing the coronavirus outbreak.  \n Trudeau's government has long urged Canadians feeling ill to stay at home, but he told reporters at his daily press conference outside his residence that Transport Canada had now formalized travel rules as COVID-19 cases steadily rise.  \n Trudeau had been in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus. In a statement on Saturday, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau said she had \"received the all clear from my physician and Ottawa Public Health.\"  \n Canada's domestic travel restrictions will take effect on Monday at noon EDT.  \n Asked how screening would be different, Trudeau said the government was giving new tools to airlines and railways. Transport Canada later said airline and rail company staff would ask health questions of passengers and look for visible symptoms.  \n Even enhanced screening offers \"no guarantee\" that sick people will not board, as they can hide symptoms, Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, said in a separate press conference.  \n Canada has confirmed 5,153 cases of coronavirus, and 55 deaths, health officials said. While case numbers are climbing, the rate of growth in British Columbia, the Pacific Coast province where community transmission was first reported, seems to be slowing, Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said.  \n \"There are signs of hope,\" she told reporters in Ottawa.  \n In the province of Quebec, however, the number of cases jumped by 24% in the past day to nearly 2,500, more than double any other province. Four additional deaths raised Quebec's death toll to 22.  \n New police checkpoints were set to begin restricting non-essential traffic to eight Quebec regions on Saturday, Quebec Deputy Premier Genevieve Guilbault.  \n Ontario banned public events and gatherings of more than five people on Saturday.  \n Air Canada, the country's biggest airline, said it would operate a special flight returning Canadians from Algeria on Tuesday, with additional flights scheduled from Peru and Ecuador.  \n China's embassy in Ottawa tweeted that the Bank of China had on Friday donated medical supplies to Canada, including thousands of masks, goggles and gloves.  \n Trudeau has faced criticism at home for sending a shipment of protective equipment to China in February, before COVID-19 cases spiked in Canada.

A Direcção-Geral de Saúde diz que está a ser avaliado o primeiro caso suspeito de contaminação pelo coronavírus em Portugal. Aguardam-se os resultados das análises laboratoriais. Segundo o comunicado, o doente regressou este fim-de-semana da China e já se encontra no Hospital de Curry Cabral, em Lisboa, Hospital de Referência para estas situações. \nNa Austrália, o primeiro-ministro australiano, Scott Morrison, anunciou este sábado que foi detectado o primeiro caso de um paciente infectado com o novo coronavírus, que já matou 41 pessoas na China.\nNum comunicado divulgado através do Twitter, Morrison afirmou que se trata de um cidadão chinês de Wuhan, onde o surto começou, que viajou para Melbourne, na Austrália, a 19 de Janeiro. “Está a ser tratado em isolamento num hospital em Victoria [capital do Estado]. As autoridades estão a localizar e a entrar em contacto com todos os passageiros que viajaram no mesmo voo para Melbourne e com todas as pessoas que tenham tido contacto com o homem desde essa altura”, referiu o primeiro-ministro, acrescentando que “já era esperado que o vírus chegasse à Austrália”. Scott Morrison garantiu que os serviços de saúde australianos estão preparados para diagnosticar, isolar e tratar qualquer caso do novo coronavírus.\nTambém a ministra francesa da Saúde, Agnès Buzyn, anunciou esta sexta-feira que foram identificados três casos de infecção no país: um paciente em Bordéus e outros dois na zona de Paris. Estes foram os primeiros casos confirmados no continente europeu, depois de os 14 casos de pacientes que estavam a ser examinados no Reino Unido terem sido descartados como negativos — as autoridades britânicas procuram dois mil viajantes que chegaram recentemente de Wuhan para serem submetidos a exames.\nOs Estados Unidos, França e também Portugal admitiram este sábado vir a retirar os seus cidadãos da cidade chinesa de Wuhan.\nEntretanto, os casos confirmados e suspeitas de infecção multiplicam-se em vários pontos do globo: Taiwan (três casos confirmados), Tailândia (quatro casos), Japão (três casos), Nepal (um caso), Malásia (três casos), Coreia do Sul (dois casos), EUA (dois casos), Singapura (três casos), Vietname (pelo menos um caso), Macau (um caso), França (três casos) e agora na Austrália (um caso).\nNa China, as autoridades anunciaram na noite desta sexta-feira que o número de vítimas mortais do surto subiu para 41, e que há agora 1300 casos confirmados de infecção. A 41.ª vítima é um médico de 62 anos que morreu em Wuhan depois de estar em contacto com pacientes e contrair o vírus.\nUm pouco por todo o país estão a ser tomadas medidas para se conter a propagação deste coronavírus, chamado 2019-nCoV, a apenas alguns dias da celebração do Ano Novo chinês. Vários eventos de Ano Novo foram cancelados, incluindo em Macau. Pelo menos 18 cidades da província de Hubei, com uma população de 60 milhões e cuja capital é Wuhan, decretaram quarentena e impuseram restrições de movimentação — sendo que muitas cidades suspenderam completamente os serviços de transporte. Em Wuhan, por exemplo, não há serviço de autocarro, metro ou barco e foram cancelados todos os aviões e comboios com destino a outras cidades.\nSegundo noticia este sábado o jornal chinês People's Daily​, um segundo hospital será especialmente construído “dentro de duas semanas” na cidade de Wuhan para tratar os doentes. O novo hospital terá capacidade para 1300 camas, às quais se somarão os lugares que estão previstos para o primeiro hospital para pacientes portadores do vírus que será construído em dez dias, conforme foi anunciado esta sexta-feira, acrescenta o jornal estatal.\nEm Xangai, todos os cinemas foram encerrados até 30 de Janeiro para tentar impedir a propagação do vírus. O Governo chinês também ordenou que as entradas em monumentos públicos, onde se juntam milhares de pessoas, fossem suspensas ou canceladas. É o caso da Grande Muralha da China ou da Disneyland. Segundo os meios de comunicação chineses, mais de 1200 militares e médicos foram enviados para Wuhan para ajudar.\nO Presidente chinês convocou para este sábado uma reunião especial do Governo com o objectivo de definir medidas para combater a propagação do vírus. Citado pela televisão do Estado no dia do feriado do Ano Novo Chinês,  Xi Jinping alertou para uma “situação grave” e disse que o vírus está a “acelerar a sua velocidade”, anunciando ainda que vários recursos e especialistas médicos estão a ser encaminhados para a região de Wuhan.\nHong Kong declarou o estado de emergência devido ao novo coronavírus e vai manter encerradas as escolas primárias e secundárias durante as duas próximas semanas, depois das férias do Ano Novo Chinês. Outra das medidas anunciadas este sábado foi a decisão de bloquear o acesso de comboios e aviões com origem na cidade chinesa de Wuhan, onde o vírus foi detectado pela primeira vez no final do ano passado.\nDepois de três casos detectados em França, o Centro Europeu para o Controlo e Prevenção de Doenças (ECDC, na sigla inglesa) afirma que é provável que outros sejam registados na União Europeia. Num comunicado divulgado este sábado, o ECDC refere que este desenvolvimento “não foi inesperado”, mas que o facto de os casos terem sido identificados prova que a detecção e confirmação do novo vírus está a funcionar. O Centro assegura que a maior parte dos países europeus têm as capacidades necessárias para prevenir e controlar um surto assim que os casos sejam detectados.\n“A maior parte dos países da UE possui planos e medidas para conter este tipo de infecção e a Europa possui laboratórios bem equipados que podem confirmar casos prováveis, além de hospitais preparados para tratar os pacientes de acordo”, lê-se na nota.\nAs autoridades portuguesas estão a cooperar com outros países europeus para reforçar o apoio aos cidadãos nacionais que se encontram em Wuhan, admitindo a possibilidade de retirá-los da chinesa. “Estamos em contacto com os cidadãos e a cooperar com outros países europeus para procurar reforçar o apoio aos compatriotas portugueses retidos” em Wuhan, disse este sábado à Lusa fonte do gabinete da secretária de Estado das Comunidades Portuguesas, Berta Nunes.

O consulado dos EUA está a contactá-los para oferecer um lugar no avião especial que partirá este domingo da cidade chinesa. A aeronave tem lugar para apenas 230 pessoas, onde se incluem diplomatas do consulado dos EUA e cidadãos norte-americanos e as suas famílias.

China yesterday said President Xi Jinping's state visit to Japan would be postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. \n The trip, initially expected next month, would have been the first of its kind in nearly a decade and had been touted as a sign of warming ties between the world's second-and third-largest economies. \n China and Japan are both currently fighting the novel coronavirus epidemic, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian at a press briefing in Beijing. \n \"Both sides agreed on the necessity of ensuring that Chairman Xi Jinping's state visit to Japan takes place at the most appropriate timing, environment and atmosphere, and achieves full success.\" \n The two sides \"will maintain close communication regarding the timing of the visit\", he added. \n This comes as China yesterday reported 139 new coronavirus infections, slightly up from 119 the previous day, taking the total number of infections to 80,409. There were 31 new deaths, all from outbreak epicentre Hubei province, taking the death toll to 3,012. \n It appears that a strict lockdown of cities and other travel restrictions across the country are paying off, with official figures showing a steady drop in new cases in recent weeks, leading some provinces to lower their emergency response levels. But China is now concerned about imported infections, with the virus having spread to some 80 countries, infecting more than 15,000 and killing more than 200 overseas. \n Meanwhile, Japan will suspend existing visas for visitors from China and South Korea and quarantine them for two weeks, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told a Cabinet-level task force yesterday. \n Agence France-Presse reported that the measure would start on Monday and last at least until the end of the month. \n Mr Abe also reportedly asked that flights from China and South Korea use only two airports - Narita airport east of Tokyo and Kansai airport in Osaka. \n Japan will also suspend the transport of passengers from China and South Korea by ship in and out of Japan, and cancel temporary and multiple-entry visas for visitors from the two countries. \n Meanwhile, China is considering donating money to the World Health Organisation to help battle the coronavirus, its Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs said. \n Mr Ma Zhaoxu told a news briefing yesterday that China will make donations to South Korea, Iraq, Cambodia and Sri Lanka, on top of what it has already given to Pakistan, Japan and Iran. \n Mr Ma said, thanks to diplomatic relations, China received donations of protective equipment and medical supplies when it was in the throes of the outbreak. \n He specially mentioned Pakistan, which gave masks to China from its national inventory. \n But other gifts were less conventional: Myanmar provided rice, Sri Lanka provided black tea, and during a state visit last week, Mongolian President Khaltmaagiin Battulga gave China 30,000 sheep. \n "}, {"content": "Coronavirus testing counters in Northeast airports.

Briefe und Päckchen aus China? Kann man gefahrenfrei entgegennehmen. Impfungen gegen Lungenentzündungen? Helfen nicht gegen das neue Coronavirus. Sollte man Knoblauch essen? Ist zwar gesund, aber es gebe keinen Nachweis, dass es vor dem Erreger schütze.\nDiese Fragen und Antworten stammen von der Website der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO). Unter einer Rubrik namens myth busters versucht die WHO, Mythen zu bekämpfen. Die zu den Vereinten Nationen gehörende Behörde will damit den Gerüchten um das neue Coronavirus etwas entgegensetzen. Denn Gerüchte, Falschinformationen und Verschwörungstheorien verbreiten sich schneller als das Virus selbst.\nEnde 2019 brach in China ein neues Virus aus, 2019nCoV, eng verwandt mit dem tödlichen Sars-Virus. Mittlerweile sind Tausende Menschen infiziert, Hunderte gestorben, längst haben etliche Länder Fälle vermeldet. Weil der Erreger noch vergangenes Jahr unbekannt war und die Folgen des Ausbruchs noch nicht abschätzbar sind, ist das Bedürfnis nach Wissen groß: Google Trends verzeichnet für Januar ein schnell zunehmendes Suchaufkommen zum Coronavirus. Eine Nachfrage, die nicht ungedeckt bleibt: Auf Twitter wurden in den vergangenen vier Wochen mehr als 15 Millionen Tweets zum Coronavirus abgesetzt, in den Medien erscheinen täglich neue Nachrichten und Einschätzungen. Es sind so viele Beiträge, dass die WHO von einer Infodemie schreibt, einem Überfluss an Informationen – korrekten, aber auch falschen.\nIm Allgemeinen muss man zwischen ungesicherten Informationen, aus dem Kontext gerissenen oder falschen Nachrichten und Verschwörungstheorien unterscheiden. So kursiert im Netz etwa die Geschichte über ein Elternpaar, das angeblich ihre zwei kranken Kinder am Flughafen zurückgelassen hat. Belege gibt es dafür nicht. Genauso bei einem Video, das in alarmistischem Ton angebliche Fakten über das Virus verbreitet. Die Behauptungen darin seien teils übertrieben, teils unbelegt, teils falsch, wie das Portal Correctiv recherchiert hat. Es gibt aber auch Verschwörungstheorien. So heißt es, der Ausbruch beruhe auf einem Komplott des Microsoft-Gründers Bill Gates. Auch das stimmt nicht.\nNun mag man diese Informationen noch harmlos finden. Teils aber sind die Falschinformationen, die sich rund um das neue Coronavirus verbreiten, schädlich, gar lebensgefährlich. Etwa dann, wenn sie angebliche Heilmittel oder Behandlungen anpreisen. So rät das indische Ministerium für Ayurveda, Yoga und Naturheilkunde zur homöopathischen Behandlung der Coronavirus-Lungenerkrankung. Dabei ist die Wirkung von Homöopathie über den Placebo-Effekt hinaus nicht nachgewiesen. Und auf Facebook geht das Gerücht um, dass es eine Coronavirus-Infektion kuriere, eine chemische Lösung namens MMS zu trinken. Das ist nicht nur falsch, sondern bei Anwendung sogar lebensbedrohlich. Facebook, gewöhnlich nicht bekannt für seine intensive Auseinandersetzung mit falschen Inhalten, hat nun angekündigt, entsprechende Beiträge von seiner Plattform zu entfernen. Twitter will irreführende Beiträge nicht nur löschen, sondern bei der Suche nach dem Coronavirus nur glaubwürdige Informationen anzeigen, so steht es in einem Blogbeitrag.\nDie mediale Dynamik, die man momentan beobachten kann, ist nicht neu. Sie ähnelt der anderer Nachrichtenlagen – ob Terroranschlag oder Flugzeugabsturz: Zunächst passiert etwas Schlimmes, dann verbreiten sich in den sozialen Medien Informationen in Minutenschnelle, schließlich berichten Medien. Menschen lesen Posts oder Artikel, suchen nach mehr Informationen, nach Gewissheit. Weil es aber noch wenig gesichertes Wissen gibt, entsteht Raum für Gerüchte, Falschinformationen und gar Verschwörungstheorien. Der Effekt verstärkt sich dadurch, dass sich der Wissensstand rund um das Zentrum der Nachrichtenlage – in diesem Falle die Coronavirus-Erkrankung – ständig ändern kann und das, was heute gewiss scheint, morgen schon widerlegt sein könnte.\nNicole Krämer arbeitet als Professorin für Sozialpsychologie an der Universität Duisburg-Essen und forscht unter anderem zu Fake-News. Sie sieht für die Verbreitung falscher und ungesicherter Informationen mehrere Gründe: \"Noch ist vieles um das Coronavirus unklar\", sagt sie, \"das sorgt für Unsicherheit.\" Und weil der Ausbruch zur Pandemie zu werden droht und damit auch jeder und jede in Deutschland irgendwann Gefahr laufen könnte, sich anzustecken, sei das Informationsbedürfnis besonders groß. Menschen verschickten Informationen, die sie sehen, zu schnell, sagt Krämer – oft ohne die Nachricht genau gelesen zu haben. Bilder mit besonders erschreckenden Motiven, etwa Aufnahmen aus überfüllten Krankenhausfluren, auf denen Patienten am Boden liegen, befeuerten das: \"Einige Texte werden sicherlich auch weitergeleitet, weil die Macht der Bilder so stark ist\", sagt Krämer. Für die Verbreitung falscher Informationen seien wir alle verantwortlich. \"Es ist weniger relevant, wer eine falsche Nachricht in die Welt setzt, sondern wer sie verbreitet. Und das sind meistens Menschen, keine Bots\", sagt Krämer.\nAber natürlich werden Falschinformationen nicht nur unwissentlich gestreut. Es gebe auch Akteure, die die Informationen gezielt weiterverbreiten, sagt Krämer. Das könnten Laien sein, die einfach nur Aufmerksamkeit wollen, aber auch staatliche Akteure, die Unruhe stiften wollen.\nHinzu kommt: Gerade bei Gesundheitsthemen werde viel auf die Erfahrung anderer vertraut, sagte der Kommunikationswissenschaftler Markus Schäfer von der Universität in Mainz dem ZDF. Gemeinsam mit Kolleginnen und Kollegen hat er untersucht, wie sich Internetnutzerinnen über Gesundheit informieren. Demnach gibt fast jeder zweite Befragte (46 Prozent) an, sich in persönlichen Gesprächen mit Familie, Freunden und Kolleginnen über Gesundheitsthemen zu informieren. 39 Prozent nutzen dazu das Internet, in der Altersgruppe von 18 bis 29 waren es sogar 46 Prozent (Fachzeitschrift für Onlineberatung und computervermittelte Kommunikation: Schäfer et al., 2019). Nur seien Gesundheitsthemen oft sehr komplex. \"Deshalb verbreiten sich Falschinformationen in diesem Bereich so gut\", sagt Schäfer. Die Medizin ist eben keine exakte Wissenschaft. In der ärztlichen Praxis fließen wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse und Erfahrungswissen zusammen. Da ist mitunter mehr Platz für Gerüchte als bei naturwissenschaftlichen Fragen.\nDie Wirkung solcher falschen Informationen ist nicht nur kurzfristig problematisch, sondern auch langfristig. In der Psychologie spricht man vom Falschinformationseffekt: Liest man direkt nach einem Ereignis falsche Informationen, kann das dazu führen, dass man sich die merkt – auch wenn man eigentlich wissen müsste, dass sie nicht stimmen (zum Beispiel Loftus, 2005). \"Evolutionspsychologisch ist das normal\", sagt Sozialpsychologin Krämer. Wir glaubten erst einmal das, was wir sehen, und zweifelten nicht sofort alles an. Das Problem sei, dass Falschinformationen genauso rezipiert würden wie Fakten. Die falsche Information könne nur schwer überschrieben werden. Selbst wenn Menschen eine Berichtigung gelesen haben, könne es daher passieren, dass sie sich die falsche Information merken.\nNoch schwieriger wird es, wenn die Falschinformation, die man liest, ins eigene Weltbild passt. Denn wir alle neigen dazu, das zu glauben, was wir gerne glauben wollen. In der Psychologie heißt das confirmation bias. Im Fall des Coronavirus ist das gut zu beobachten: Wer glauben will, dass die Welt mitten in einer Pandemie steckt, wird Informationen finden und teilen, die dazu passen. Wer glauben will, der Erreger sei harmlos, findet gegenteilige Infos. Dabei ist aktuell noch unklar, wie tödlich das Virus wirklich ist – und ob der Ausbruch globale Ausmaße annehmen wird.\nWie kann man also sichergehen, dass das, was man liest, auch wirklich stimmt? \"Wer online einen Text sieht, sollte ihn nicht einfach teilen, sondern ganz durchlesen\", sagt Sozialpsychologin Krämer. Es helfe außerdem, auf die Quellen zu achten. Beruht ein Beitrag auf wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen? Lässt sich das, was dort steht, überprüfen? Zitiert jemand nur aus anderen Medien? Was ist die Originalquelle? Gibt es überhaupt eine? Das mag banal klingen, kann aber effektiv dabei helfen, Falschinformationen zu identifizieren. Auch Medien seien daher in der Verantwortung, Berichte zu korrigieren, wenn sie ursprünglich falsche Informationen enthielten, so Krämer.\nSchon jetzt wünschen sich Expertinnen und Experten eine globale Medienstrategie für künftige Krankheitsausbrüche. \"Wir brauchen wirksame Medienbeobachter, die überwachen, wie über Krankheitsausbrüche berichtet wird\", schreiben Ilona Kickbusch, Professorin für globale Gesundheit in Genf, und Gabriel Leung, Dekan für Medizin an der Universität in Hongkong, in einem Beitrag für das Fachblatt British Medical Journal. Die WHO solle künftig nicht nur soziale Medien kontaktieren, sondern auch mit bekannten Faktencheckern zusammenarbeiten. So könne man auch herausfinden, ob Informationen zurückgehalten oder kritische Journalistinnen und Journalisten zum Schweigen gebracht würden.\nEnde 2019 meldeten die chinesischen Behörden der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO eine Häufung von Lungenentzündungen unklarer Ursache in der zentralchinesischen Stadt Wuhan. Bereits eine Woche später identifizierten chinesische Forscher ein neuartiges Virus als Ursache der Krankheitsfälle. Es gehört zur Gruppe der Coronaviren. Wenige Tage darauf veröffentlichte eine Gruppe um den Virologen Christian Drosten von der Berliner Charité den ersten diagnostischen Test für das neue Virus, das Forscher provisorisch 2019-nCoV nennen. Mit dem Test kann das Virus im Labor nachgewiesen werden. Als Quelle des Erregers vermuten die chinesischen Behörden einen Lebensmittelmarkt in Wuhan, auf dem neben Fisch und Meeresfrüchten auch exotische Tiere wie Schlangen verkauft wurden. Der Markt wurde geschlossen und desinfiziert.\nSowohl die Atemwegserkrankungen Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) als auch Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) werden von Coronaviren verursacht, die ihren Ursprung in Tieren haben. Während der Sars-Pandemie infizierten sich in den Jahren 2002 und 2003 etwa 8.000 Menschen, mehr als 750 starben. Mit dem Mers-Virus haben sich seit seiner Entdeckung 2012 bis zum Jahresende 2019 etwa 2.500 Menschen angesteckt, jeder Dritte ist daran gestorben. Insgesamt gibt es aber mehrere Hundert Arten von Coronaviren. Viele von ihnen betreffen die Atemwege und können zum Beispiel Erkältungen verursachen.\nIn China sind inzwischen mehrere Tausend Personen erkrankt, einige von ihnen – die meisten wohl mit Vorerkrankungen – sind an einer Lungenentzündung infolge des Virus gestorben. Die ersten Infektionsfälle außerhalb Chinas wurden in Thailand, Japan und Südkorea bekannt. Es handelt sich um Reisende, die vorher in Wuhan gewesen waren. Am 21. Januar meldeten US-Behörden die erste Infektion bei einem Touristen, der aus Wuhan zurückkam, am 24. Januar wurden die ersten Fälle in Frankreich bekannt. Mittlerweile wurden auch erste Fälle in Deutschland bestätigt. Typische Zeichen einer Infektion sind Fieber, Husten und Atembeschwerden. Das Virus kann eine Lungenentzündung verursachen, die tödlich enden kann. Da es sich um eine virale Krankheit handelt, helfen Antibiotika nicht.\nInzwischen ist klar, dass das Virus von Mensch zu Mensch übertragen werden kann. Chinesische Behörden haben mehrere solcher Übertragungen bestätigt, nachdem auch etwa ein Dutzend Fälle bei medizinischem Personal bekannt wurden. Medizinerinnen und Mediziner gehen davon aus, dass das Virus vor allem über Tröpfcheninfektion übertragen wird. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation rechnet, wie sie am 24. Januar mitteilte, momentan damit, dass ein Infizierter im Schnitt 1,4 bis 2,5 andere Menschen ansteckt. Bewahrheiten sich diese Zahlen, ist das Virus weniger ansteckend als Sars und auch die Virusgrippe. Die WHO empfiehlt generelle Hygieneregeln zu beachten: Man solle sich häufig die Hände waschen und engen Kontakt zu Personen mit Atemwegserkrankungen und wilden Tieren meiden.\nDas lässt sich noch nicht mit Sicherheit sagen. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation teilte am 28. Januar mit, dass ungefähr ein Fünftel der gemeldeten Fälle durch das Virus schwer krank werde, im Zweifelsfall also intensivmedizinisch behandelt werden muss. Berichten zufolge handelte es sich bei den ersten Todesopfern um Patienten, die teils schwere Vorerkrankungen hatten. Auch bei anderen Infektionskrankheiten sind Menschen mit Vorerkrankungen besonders gefährdet – etwa bei der Grippe. Coronaviren sind dafür bekannt, dass sie mutieren, also ihr Erbgut verändern können. Das kann dazu führen, dass sie im Laufe eines Ausbruchs gefährlicher für Menschen werden – aber auch zum genauen Gegenteil. Das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) erwartet zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt keine ähnlich hohe Mortalität wie beim Ausbruch von Sars.\nMehr zum Ausbruch des neuen Coronavirus lesen Sie hier.\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 1-Germany is at start of coronavirus epidemic -health minister.

Spahn added that Germany was well equipped with isolation wards in hospitals if they should be needed in larger numbers.\n“We are acting swiftly and adapting our reactions to the current situation, and unfortunately I have to say that the situation has changed in the past hours,” he said.\nIn Europe, Italy has become a front line in the global outbreak with 322 cases. Italians, or people who had recently visited the country, have tested positive in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Romania, Spain and Switzerland.\nA second person suffering from the coronavirus died in France as health officials tried to find out how the college teacher, who had not visited any country with a known outbreak, had caught the new disease.\nThe new coronavirus, believed to have originated from illegal wildlife sold in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has infected some 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700 people, most of them in China.

Indian benchmark equity indices on Thursday collapsed once again as Sensex fell over 2,500 points while Nifty was down over 760 points or over seven per cent. The stock market shock comes a day after the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.\nAs far as domestic stock markets are concerned, the freefall has led to a significant rise in the volatility index, which indicates that investors still remain worried about the prevailing economic disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak.\nHere are key factors which led to the bloodbath on D-Street on Thursday:\nCoronavirus now a pandemic\nThe coronavirus is now a pandemic, declared WHO on Thursday. The development was announced by WHO in view of the rapid rise in Covid-19 infections around the globe. Declaring it as a pandemic triggered a massive slump in stock markets across the world. Asian, European and US market indices took a pounding as investors remain spooked. The US has suspended travel from Europe while India has suspended all tourist visa till April 15.\nIn the morning trade, aviation and tourism stocks plummeted sharply after as a result of the fresh restrictions on travel.\nIt is worth mentioning that the WHO has declared the novel coronavirus as a pandemic and added that Italy and Iran were the hotspot countries. It said other countries could join them soon.\nThe WHO declared the new coronavirus as a pandemic for the first time on Wednesday, adding that Italy and Iran were now on the frontline of the disease and other countries would soon join them. The global toll death toll has crossed 4,500 while India has recorded at least 73 positive cases.\nOil slides further\nAnother reason why domestic stock markets fell was a further slide in global crude oil prices. Oil prices have continued to slide since the major crash on March 6 following a meeting of the OPEC countries and Russia. A price war was triggered as Saudi slashed oil prices, resulting in the collapse of global crude oil prices.\nWhile prices had recovered slightly on March 11, the lower prices keep hurting sentiments of major oil companies in the country. Power and energy companies are also taking a pounding in the domestic stock market due to reduced prices. Though the general notion is that India benefits from any cut in global crude prices, the recent deep cut may not be ideal for the country.\nSharp fall in oil prices also has a greater impact on the equity market, as witnessed in the past few days. It could even disrupt the flow for foreign capital into the India market if crude prices keep falling.\nGlobal market rout\nNot just India but markets around the globe have witnessed carnage over the past few days due to the coronavirus outbreak. From Dow Jones in the US to other major markets in the world, each one has registered serious falls due to rising doubts over the total financial impact of the virus outbreak.\nStock markets around the world crumbled after Trump's move, with U.S. stock index futures diving 4.7% and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tumbling 4.1% to its lowest level since early 2019.\nAs the virus keeps spreading across the globe rapidly, analysts expect the carnage to continue until there is a global decline in new positive cases.\nInvestors will also be monitoring the situation in China, which conveyed that the number of cases in the epicentre Hubei province and Wuhan reduced significantly.\n"}, {"content": "El coronavirus de Wuhan | España estima que la epidemia puede “remitir pronto”. El número de afectados por el coronavirus de Wuhan en China alcanza los 9.720 y ya supera al total de casos en la epidemia de SARS de 2003 en todo el mundo, 8.096. Las víctimas mortales alcanzan este viernes las 213 personas, según los datos oficiales. El coronavirus 2019-nCoV puede provocar neumonía con síntomas como fiebre alta, tos seca, dolor de cabeza y dificultad para respirar. Su periodo de incubación medio es de tres a siete días, con un máximo de 14. Los científicos chinos han confirmado que, a diferencia del SARS, es posible el contagio durante la incubación. La OMS ha declarado una emergencia internacional por el brote.\nLos casos sospechosos se elevan ya a 15.238, según la Comisión Nacional de Sanidad, mientras que 171 enfermos han conseguido recuperarse. Se mantiene en observación a 102.427 personas que han estado en contacto con infectados.\nLa mayor parte de los fallecidos, el 90%, procede de la provincia de Hubei, donde se encuentra la ciudad de Wuhan y foco de la epidemia. En las últimas 24 horas, en las que se han registrado 43 muertes, todas menos una correspondían a esta provincia.\nEspaña ya está aplicando \"casi todo lo que dice la OMS\", organismo que este jueves declaró la emergencia internacional por la expansión del coronavirus. El director del Centro de Coordinación de Alertas y Emergencias Sanitarias del Ministerio de Sanidad, Fernando Simón, ha explicado este viernes a la prensa que estas medidas no son sustancialmente distintas a lo que recomendó la OMS hace una semana, y que no incluyen ni restricciones de viaje ni de comercio, informa Pablo Linde.\n\"No esperamos que en España se produzca más que algún caso importado. No creemos que se vayan a producir transmisiones aquí, pero nos estamos preparando para ese escenario\", ha afirmado Simón. El director del Centro de Coordinación de Alertas y Emergencias Sanitarias se ha mostrado sorprendido con la declaración del estado de emergencia en Italia. \"No es el consenso de la UE y en España por el momento no se plantea\", ha asegurado.\nCon los datos preliminares, \"los indicios son que la enfermedad no es excesivamente transmisible. Solo se transmite de forma comunitaria en una zona y parece que la epidemia tiene posibilidades de comenzar a remitir pronto\", ha afirmado. La zona de transmisión es solo Hubei, la provincia de China donde se encuentra Wuhan. \"Hay provincias chinas con menos casos que otros países. Sería incoherente recomendar no viajar a todo el país\", ha opinado.\nSimón ha explicado que tres médicos y una enfermera acompañarán a los españoles evacuados desde Wuhan en su vuelo, que despegó esta madrugada de la ciudad china. Los ciudadanos de países nórdicos que viajan a bordo serán llevados a sus países de origen nada más aterrizar en el aeropuerto de Torrejón de Ardoz, en España.\nEl Consejo de Ministros italiano ha aprobado este viernes un decreto por el que declara el estado de emergencia por el coronavirus, tras la decisión de la Organización Mundial de la Salud de decretar la emergencia global. \"Se trata simplemente de tomar nota de la decisión de la OMS\", han dicho fuentes gubernamentales italianas. El Gobierno ha asignado cinco millones de euros iniciales para hacer frente a la expansión del virus. El ministro de Salud, Roberto Speranza, ha explicado que son medidas de precaución, y que a la luz de la declaración de emergencia internacional se han activado los instrumentos reglamentarios para estos casos.\nItalia ya declaró el estado de emergencia sanitaria cuando se registró la epidemia del SARS en 2002. Este mecanismo, utilizado por ejemplo después de terremotos o inundaciones como las de Venecia, permite activar fondos y movilizar a organismos, como la protección civil, con el fin de preparar estructuras de acogida de personas.\nEl primer ministro italiano, Guiseppe Conte, confirmó este jueves dos casos de coronavirus, que afectan a dos turistas chinos que llegaron al país en enero. Como medida de precaución, las autoridades de Italia han decidido cancelar las conexiones aéreas con China para evitar la propagación del brote. También este jueves, 6.000 pasajeros estuvieron bloqueados a bordo de un crucero en el puerto romano de Civitavecchia en el que había una pareja que presentaba síntomas compatibles con el coronavirus. Finalmente, tras confirmarse los resultados negativos de los análisis, el pasaje puedo desembarcar.\n\"Podemos confirmar que dos pacientes en Inglaterra, miembros de la misma familia, han dado positivo\", ha anunciado el jefe de los servicios médicos ingleses, Chris Whitty, en un comunicado difundido por el Ministerio de Salud, en el que no han dado más detalles sobre los afectados para preservar su privacidad. Fuera de China, la epidemia se ha extendido a una veintena de países, que acumulan en torno a los 130 casos.\nLos dos afectados en Inglaterra \"están recibiendo cuidados especializados de los servicios sanitarios\" y se están empleando \"procedimientos de control de infecciones a fin de prevenir que el virus se propague\", según Whitty.\nLos expertos médicos británicos ya habían alertado de que era \"altamente probable\" que se registraran casos de coronavirus en Reino Unido. \"El Servicio Nacional de Salud está extremadamente bien preparado y habituado a gestionar infecciones y estamos ya trabajando rápidamente para identificar a cualquiera que haya entrado en contacto con los pacientes para prevenir una mayor expansión\", ha añadido Whitty.\nTailandia, el país con más afectados después de China, con 19 casos, ha confirmado el primer contagio directo entre humanos producido dentro del país. También India ha confirmado su primer positivo, informa Ángel Martínez. Se trata de una estudiante india procedente de Wuhan,que llevaba una semana en un pabellón de aislamiento en el distrito de Thrissur, en el estado sureño de Kerala. Rusia también ha anunciado este viernes los dos primeros casos confirmados.\nMientras que ya ha aterrizado en la base aérea británica de Brize Norton el avión fletado por el Gobierno británico que transporta a sus ciudadanos y la veintena de españoles evacuados, otros países continúan la repatriación de sus nacionales.\nEl avión militar con los primeros 180 franceses repatriados de Wuhan aterrizó este viernes al mediodía en la base aérea de Istres, en el sur de Francia, informa Silvia Ayuso. Aunque antes de despegar desde la ciudad china habían dado negativo en las pruebas del coronavirus 2019-nCoV, uno de los pasajeros presentó durante el vuelo síntomas y fue llevado de inmediato al hospital marsellés de Timone, anunció la ministra de Salud, Agnès Buzyn, que acudió a recibir a los repatriados. Los demás fueron trasladados a un centro de vacaciones en Carry-le-Rouet, una localidad en la costa mediterránea a 30 kilómetros Marsella, donde deberán pasar los próximos 14 días en cuarentena.\nEl recinto cumple los requisitos que habían impuesto las autoridades al buscar un lugar donde acoger a los repatriados: “Un criterio ante todo sanitario con habitaciones aisladas, que también esté cerca de un hospital y, además, que sea agradable y cálido. El centro de vacaciones de Carry-le-Rouet respondía a todos esos criterios”, explicó Buzyn. Aunque los repatriados, que deberán someterse dos veces al día a pruebas para verificar que no presentan síntomas, podrán moverse libremente por el recinto, no podrán abandonarlo —varios gendarmes apostados en el exterior velarán por que nadie salga ni entre sin permiso— y deberán portar máscaras cuando estén en zonas comunes. Además, dijo la ministra, aunque podrán recibir paquetes, no se permitirá la visita de familiares. Más de medio centenar de profesionales de la salud se turnarán durante las próximas dos semanas para acompañar y supervisar a los ciudadanos repatriados, a los que en los próximos días se podría unir un nuevo contingente, ya que según anunció la Comisión Europea, está previsto que se flete un nuevo avión para trasladar a otros ciudadanos franceses que deseen partir de Wuhan, así como a otros extranjeros que también puedan hacerlo, en principio sobre todo europeos.\nEn París, el Instituto Pasteur anunció este viernes por su parte que ha conseguido aislar las cepas del coronavirus detectado en Francia y ha constituido un grupo de trabajo para buscar posibles soluciones, entre ellas una vacuna que podría estar disponible en 20 meses. Según explicó su director científico, Christophe d’Enfert, la idea es trabajar sobre una modificación de la vacuna contra el sarampión. “Hemos desarrollado una plataforma que en ocho meses nos permitirá obtener un virus atenuado que podamos probar en animales”, explicó. “Si todo va bien”, subrayó, a finales de agosto se podría entrar en la fase clínica, agregó. Tomando como modelo el trabajo realizado sobre el ébola, dijo, esta debería durar un año y, de nuevo “si todo va bien”, se podría disponer de una vacuna en un periodo de tiempo de 20 meses.\nMientras, un vuelo organizado por el Gobierno surcoreano ha aterrizado este viernes en Seúl con 368 personas a bordo, el primero de una serie de cuatro para rescatar a personas de esta nacionalidad. Una de las que figuraban en la lista no pudo embarcar debido a presentar fiebre, y 18 de los pasajeros han sido enviados al hospital a su llegada. El resto de los repatriados pasará la cuarentena en centros de aislamiento en las ciudades de Asan y Jincheon, a unos 80 kilómetros al sur de Seúl, una decisión que ha hecho estallar protestas entre sus residentes.\nEstados Unidos, que ha emitido una alerta de “no viajar” a China debido al coronavirus, ha apuntado que enviará un segundo avión el día 3 de febrero después del que este miércoles repatrió a más de 200 de sus ciudadanos.\nJapón también pide a sus ciudadanos desde este viernes que no viajen a China si no es estrictamente necesario. Este país repatrió este jueves a una tercera tanda de nacionales en un vuelo chárter en el que viajaban 149 pasajeros. Ocho de ellos fueron trasladados a un centro médico en ambulancia, según ha informado la cadena de televisión nipona NHK. El resto será sometido a pruebas para determinar si son portadores del virus y, mientras aguardan los resultados, se alojarán en instalaciones ofrecidas por el Gobierno en Tokio.\nColombia, Costa Rica y El Salvador también se plantean una evacuación conjunta de sus nacionales, que saldrían de Wuhan por vía terrestre y cumplirían la cuarentena en otra ciudad china. Si no muestran síntomas, esos ciudadanos podrán viajar a cualquier otra localidad en la República Popular o regresar a sus naciones de origen. Según ha informado el Ministerio de Exteriores en Bogotá, 14 de sus compatriotas han expresado su deseo de salir del foco de la epidemia.\nTras la declaración de emergencia internacional de la OMS, El Salvador ha prohibido la entrada de viajeros procedentes de China en sus fronteras. “Esperamos que sea una medida temporal”, ha indicado el presidente del país centroamericano, Nayib Bukele, en una rueda de prensa. Filipinas ha adoptado este viernes un veto similar para quienes provengan de la provincia de Hubei.\nSingapur ha prohibido la entrada a todos los visitantes chinos o de otra nacionalidad que hayan viajado recientemente a China. La medida, una de las más restrictivas hasta ahora para tratar de contener la expansión del virus, será efectiva desde este sábado, y se aplicará también a pasajeros en tránsito. Como excepción, están los residentes y portadores de permisos de largo plazo, como los de trabajo o los visados de estudiante.\nMongolia, que comparte una frontera de casi 5.000 kilómetros con China, ha anunciado el cierre de sus accesos a los ciudadanos extranjeros procedentes de su país vecino al menos hasta el 2 de febrero. También ha pedido el regreso de sus nacionales que se encuentran ahora mismo en China, y que tendrán hasta el día 6 para retornar. Ulan Bator trata de conseguir también la salida de treinta de sus ciudadanos atrapados en Wuhan.\nHoras después de que el comité de emergencia de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) decidiera la noche de este jueves en Ginebra declarar la emergencia internacional por el brote del coronavirus de Wuhan, el Gobierno chino ha asegurado que es capaz de “frenar y derrotar” la epidemia. En un comunicado, la Comisión Nacional de Salud ha asegurado que “China tiene confianza y es capaz de contener de manera efectiva la nueva epidemia y de acabar derrotándola”.\nEl comunicado hace hincapié en que Pekín “concede gran importancia a la prevención y el control de la neumonía causada por el nuevo coronavirus y ha tomado las medidas más estrictas para frenar la epidemia”\nEl Gobierno chino ha enviado dos aviones a Malasia y Tailandia para repatriar a cerca de 200 ciudadanos residentes en Wuhan, y que se encontraban en el extranjero cuando se anunció el cierre de la ciudad en plena temporada de vacaciones por el año nuevo chino, según ha anunciado este viernes la autoridad china de aviación civil. Se trata de dos Boeing 737 de la compañía china Xiamen Airlines.\nLa Embajada china en Japón también ha pedido a la compañía basada en Shanghái Spring Airlines que provea de vuelos chárter para los wuhaneses que se han quedado retenidos en Japón. El primero de esos vuelos saldrá del aeropuerto de Tokio este sábado.\nLa decisión se ha tomado, según la portavoz del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores, Hua Chunying, dadas las “dificultades prácticas” que estos residentes, “especialmente los procedentes de Wuhan”, han encontrado en el extranjero.\nSegún los datos del gobierno local de Hubei, en el momento del bloqueo de Wuhan y otra quincena de ciudades con una población total de 46 millones de personas, se encontraban en el exterior unos 40.000 residentes de la provincia. Entre ellos, el mayor contingente, unas 10.000 personas, se concentraba en Tailandia, el destino número uno de los turistas chinos.\nEl jefe del departamento de enfermedades infecciosas del prestigioso hospital de la Amistad Chino-Japonesa en Pekín, Zhan Qinghhuan, se ha dirigido este viernes en una rueda de prensa a quienes se recuperen de la infección por el coronavirus.\nAunque desarrollarán anticuerpos que les protegerán inicialmente de un nuevo contagio, éstos \"pueden no permanecer mucho tiempo\" en el sistema inmunológico, por lo que \"existe un riesgo de que quienes se hayan curado puedan volver a infectarse. Deben protegerse adecuadamente\", ha insistido, según publica el periódico South China Morning Post. En las últimas 24 horas se ha dado el alta a 47 pacientes en toda China que han superado la infección.\nAnte las crecientes críticas al modo en que las autoridades locales de Wuhan y Hubei gestionaron el comienzo de la crisis, ya han comenzado a producirse los primeros ceses. Tang Zhihong, responsable del departamento de Sanidad en la ciudad de Huanggang, vecina a Wuhan y la segunda del país por número de casos de infección, ha sido la primera funcionaria relevada de su cargo.\nHuanggang ha informado de cerca de 500 casos confirmados y 12 muertes en su municipio, pero cuando un equipo de inspectores del Gobierno central le preguntó, ante las cámaras de televisión, sobre la situación de uno de los hospitales a su cargo, Tang no supo responder. “Solo sé cuántas camas tiene, pero no a cuánta gente está tratando”, reconoció.\nLa respuesta de Tang había generado una ola de comentarios negativos en las redes sociales chinas. Su admisión llegaba después de que, a principios de semana, el alcalde de Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, reconociese que el gobierno municipal no difundió con toda la rapidez posible la información de que disponía en las primeras semanas de la crisis. Zhou, no obstante, precisó que, si había retenido datos, fue porque no recibió autorización de niveles más altos de Gobierno para difundirlos.\n"}, {"content": "China identifica 62 pessoas infetadas com vírus desconhecido.

HONG KONG — Medical personnel in Wuhan, outfitted in protective suits as they battle the coronavirus outbreak, wear diapers as they work through gruelling shifts, often until skin irritation from their masks leaves bloody marks on their faces, a news briefing was told on Wednesday (Feb 12). \n “When doctors and nurses are in the ward,” dressed in protective clothing that seals them off from the environment, “they cannot eat, drink or go to the bathroom”, Dr Han Ding, deputy director of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, told reporters in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. \n “Just in case they must urinate, they [wear a] diaper, and wash up after they’re done with their shift,” he said. \n Dr Han is one of hundreds of doctors brought in from beyond Wuhan to support the round-the-clock fight against the coronavirus. So far, the disease has killed more than 1,300 people worldwide, with all but two of the deaths in mainland China. Also known as novel coronavirus, or Covid-19, the illness had infected more than 60,000 globally as of Thursday. \n Leaders of medical teams described the difficult working conditions during the daily briefing held by the government of Hubei, the central China province in which Wuhan is located. \n “Wearing the protective suits is extremely uncomfortable,” said Dr Ma Xin, deputy dean of Huashan Hospital in Shanghai. “Sometimes I want to itch, but we absolutely cannot do that, so we just have to bear it. \n “Our doctors and nurses all have signs of irritation and even bloody marks on the bridges of their noses. These are the conditions of their work.” \n Dr Han said medical staff were working around the clock to care for those in the most critical condition. Nurses were putting in 4-6 hour shifts in intensive care units, while doctors were working from 6-8 hours, though shifts could go even longer, he said. \n “Doctors and nurses are wearing their equipment so long you can see the marks on their faces,” said Dr Zhou Jun, party secretary of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing. \n Dr Zhou, who serves at Tongji hospital in Wuhan, said medical staff were doing all they could to save lives, given limited supplies. \n Advanced equipment brought in from around the nation is playing a critical role in the struggle with the virus, Dr Ma said. \n “In the absence of specific medicines [for the virus], ventilators and ECMO are of great importance in the treatment,” he said. He was referring to ECMO machines, which circulate a patient’s blood through an artificial lung, giving the lungs of those in the most critical condition an opportunity to rest and recover. \n Respirators, artificial lung machines and other equipment also play a vital role in keeping the death rate from climbing higher. \n Dr Zhou said his team brought with them 15 million yuan (S$2.98 million) of cutting-edge equipment from Beijing, including not only ECMO machines but ventilators, monitors, bronchoscopes and other devices. \n “Some of this equipment is very expensive, but plays a critical role in curing patients,” Dr Zhou said. “The most important thing is to reduce the death rate, and increase the rate of those cured.” \n The World Health Organization, seeking to distinguish the virus from the disease it causes, said on Tuesday that it had named the virus SARS-CoV-2, and the disease Covid-19.

El nuevo virus de Wuhan, que ha dejado ya seis muertos en China y cientos de afectados, ha cruzado el Pacífico. Un hombre de unos 30 años que viajó a esa región china fue diagnosticado con el virus la semana pasada en Seattle, en el Estado de Washington, según confirmó este martes el Centro de Control de Enfermedades de Estados Unidos (CDC), mientras todo el país estaba pegado a la televisión para seguir el impeachment contra Donald Trump en el Senado.\nEl virus de Wuhan es un nuevo coronavirus llamado 2019-nCov que se transmite entre humanos y provoca enfermedades respiratorias. Fue detectado por primera vez hace menos de un mes. Desde esta ciudad, situada en la zona central del territorio chino y donde viven 11 millones de personas —más que Londres o Nueva York—, el patógeno comenzó a extenderse a las provincias vecinas. El pasado viernes, por ejemplo, no había ningún positivo fuera de allí, pero ahora ya son 38 los casos repartidos por otras 15 grandes urbes chinas y ha saltado a cuatro países del sureste asiático.\nEl paciente de Seattle, del que se desconoce por el momento su identidad, está ingresado en el Centro Médico Regional de Everett, la capital del condado de Snohomish (Washington). Se encuentra estable, responde al tratamiento y no se le considera un riesgo. El CDC también ha explicado que el enfermo no tenía síntomas cuando aterrizó el día 15 de enero en EE UU. Acudió al médico el pasado domingo y fue hospitalizado por una neumonía.\nEl paciente no visitó ninguno de los mercados de Wuhan, donde se confirmaron numerosos casos de afectados por el virus, pero sí estuvo en la región, según ha explicado a la prensa Nancy Messonnier, directora del departamento de enfermedades respiratorias del CDC. Las autoridades están buscando a todas las personas que han estado en contacto con el paciente estos días, explicó Messonnier. No esperan que haya más casos.\nDesde el pasado viernes 17, el CDC había impuesto controles especiales para vigilar la posible entrada del virus al país en los aeropuertos con más actividad de la costa oeste, San Francisco y Los Ángeles, y el de Nueva York. Son los tres aeropuertos con más pasajeros procedentes de la región de Wuhan. El CDC ha destinado alrededor de 100 trabajadores a estos aeropuertos y ha instalado salas de cuarentena.

A imprensa estatal chinesa divulgou este sábado um discurso do Presidente Xi Jinping que indica que o líder chinês estava ciente da potencial gravidade do surto do novo coronavírus semanas antes de a população ser alertada para a questão.\nNo início do surto, Xi Jinping adoptou uma postura que muitos consideraram como pouco activa, fomentando uma vaga de críticas sobre a resposta à crise do Governo chinês, que o forçaram, esta semana, a vir para a frente do combate à crise sanitária, lançar uma purga nos dirigentes do Partido Comunista Chinês (PCC) na província de Hubei, onde o novo vírus surgiu e iniciar uma reforma na maneira como a China lida com as emergências de saúde.\nDe uma forma inédita, os cidadãos chineses, forçados a uma quarentena de proporções gigantescas — dezenas de milhões de pessoas são confinadas às suas casas, ou submetidas a medidas de controlo que limitam severamente a sua circulação ou contacto com outras pessoas — exigem mais transparência ao Estado, mais informação sobre o que se está a passar. Xi Jinping, como fonte de autoridade de um Estado altamente centralizado, vê-se constrangido a abrir algumas janelas, deixando arejar um sistema habituado ao secretismo, ao mesmo tempo que aperta o controlo noutras partes. \nÉ através desse prisma que se deve ler a divulgação, neste domingo, do discurso feito a 3 de Fevereiro por Xi Jinping em que relata ter dado ordens, a 7 de Janeiro, durante uma reunião do Comité Permanente do Politburo, o órgão mais poderoso da política chinesa, para a execução de medidas para a prevenção de infecções pelo novo coronavírus. O discurso é publicado na revista Qiushi — descrita pelo Diário do Povo, jornal oficial do PCC, como “uma publicação de referência do Comité Central do Partido Comunista da China”. \nNeste discurso, acompanhado por fotos de Xi e outros líderes com máscaras de papel azul, o Presidente chinês diz que autorizou a quarentena sem precedentes em Wuhan a partir de 23 de Janeiro — uma cidade com 11 milhões de pessoas, que é um importante nó de transportes ferroviários, por rio e aéreo, com um centro tecnológico e de produção automóvel para marcas internacionais, e também numa área importante de produção agrícola.\nApesar de Xi relatar as suas acções desde o início de Janeiro, só no dia 20 de Janeiro Xi falou publicamente da nova doença e as autoridades chinesas reconheceram a existência da epidemia na cidade de Wuhan, que então já se tinha espalhado para outras cidades chinesas e outros países. Foi nesse dia que as autoridades de Pequim confirmaram que o Covid-19 se transmite entre humanos, altura em que o alarmismo começou a ganhar um novo tom.\nOs conselheiros de Xi Jinping terão julgado que a divulgação deste discuso mostrará que o Presidente chinês estava atento à crise desde o início — esperam com isso afastar as críticas por não ter aparecido publicamente a liderar as acções contra a emergência, que já fez 1665 mortos, num total de 68.500 infecções. “O tom geral do discurso parece defensivo”, disse ao New York Times Minxin Pei, professor de Governo no Colégio Claremont McKenna, na Califórnia (EUA). “Ele quer mudar a narrativa, que até agora tem sido muito desfavorável às lieranças chinesas.”\n“Eu acompanhei, a todo o momento, a propagação da epidemia e o progresso nos esforços para a conter, emitindo constantemente ordens oralmente e instruções”, garantiu Xi Jinping, no discurso citado pelo New York Times.\nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\nO executivo chinês enfrenta agora várias críticas e descontentamento por parte do público, que se agudizou no início deste mês após a morte de Li Wenliang, o médico chinês, de 34 anos, que lançou alertas sobre o novo novo vírus e que foi detido por “espalhar rumores” e forçado a assinar um documento a desdizer-se — e que morreu após contrair o Covid-19.\nPoucas horas depois da divulgação do discurso, a China anunciou uma queda nos novos casos de Covid-19 pelo terceiro dia consecutivo. Foram reportados este domingo 2009 novos casos na China continental, que exclui Macau e Hong Kong, elevando o número total para 68.500. A taxa de mortalidade permaneceu estável, com 142 novas mortes, informou a Comissão Nacional de Saúde. O número de mortos na China continental pelo novo coronavírus fixou-se nos 1665. Há ainda a registar um morto na região especial administrativa chinesa de Hong Kong, um nas Filipinas, um no Japão e um em França (registado este sábado), elevando o número total de mortes a nível mundial para 1669.\n"}, {"content": "China reports 39 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, all imported.

DETROIT - Ford Motor Co <F.N> on Thursday moved to hoard cash on its balance sheet, drawing down $15.4 billion from two credit lines and suspending its dividend, in a move to bolster reserves to ride out damage to its business from the coronavirus pandemic.  \n The No. 2 U.S. automaker, whose shares closed off slightly after sinking as much as 8.9% earlier in the day, also abandoned its 2020 financial forecast and said the cash would be used to deal with a squeeze on capital caused by shutdowns in production due to the fast-spreading virus.  \n The move will give Ford more than $37 billion in cash, almost matching the revenue it reported in the fourth quarter. That dwarfs the company's market capitalization of about $18 billion.  \n Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note that corporate liquidity during the outbreak was \"top of mind\" and that U.S. automakers had strong balance sheets.  \n The coronavirus outbreak, which started in China last year, has caused about 219,000 infections and more than 8,900 deaths globally.  \n Comparing the current economic situation to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Chief Executive Jim Hackett said Ford was putting in place safeguards to protect its business.  \n \"We're at war with the virus and Ford is going to win,\" Hackett told employees on a video conference.  \n Ford has come under fire from some analysts on Wall Street for moving too slowly to cut costs and restructure its business.  \n At the end of last year, it had booked only $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take in its global restructuring.  \n Since then, the outbreak has spread globally, leading Ford, General Motors Co <GM.N> and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV <FCHA.MI>, <FCAU.N> on Wednesday to announce the shutdown of their North American plants to prevent the spread of the disease among their factory workers.  \n All three Detroit automakers have seen U.S. employees test positive for COVID-19, the contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus.  \n Electric carmaker Tesla Inc <TSLA.O> on Thursday suspended production at its California car plant, starting March 24, to help stem the spread of the coronavirus, and added that its cash position was strong enough to navigate this period of uncertainty.  \n  \n OUTLOOK REVISIONS  \n The outbreak has already hit other automakers and more are expected to slash their 2020 forecasts.  \n Evercore ISI analysts said in a research note that such actions \"will be an ongoing theme in addition to the removal of (stock) buybacks.\"  \n On Wednesday, German luxury automaker BMW AG <BMWG.DE> cut its 2020 profit outlook, saying it would be \"significantly lower\" than last year. Two days before that, Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor Co Ltd <601633.SS> also cut its 2020 sales and profit targets.  \n GM and FCA did not change their profit forecasts on Thursday.  \n \"We are dedicated to managing our cost structure against this dynamic environment,\" GM said in a statement. \"We continue to monitor the situation closely and will make any necessary decisions to stay resilient.\"  \n GM had $34.6 billion in liquidity at the end of 2019, including $17.3 billion in cash.  \n \"We are evaluating the impact of all steps being taken inside the company related to the coronavirus emergency on our current financial guidance,\" FCA said in a statement, adding it would provide an update when it has \"sufficient visibility on market conditions.\"  \n FCA had 23.1 billion euros ($24.94 billion) in liquidity at the end of 2019.  \n Shares of Uber Technologies Inc <UBER.N> closed up more than 38% on Thursday after Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the ride-hailing company had plenty of cash on hand.  \n \"In any crisis, liquidity is key,\" he said on an investor call.  \n Ford said on Thursday it notified lenders it would borrow the unused amounts of the two credit lines, totaling $15.4 billion. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company had $22 billion in cash at the end of last year.  \n The dividend suspension will save Ford money at an annual rate of $2.4 billion.  \n The company said it was prioritizing financial flexibility and investments in future technologies such as self-driving cars and a series of important 2020 vehicle launches including a redesigned version of its top-selling F-150 full-size pickup truck.  \n Ford also withdrew its 2020 profit outlook. In February, before the coronavirus hit the United States, it offered a weaker-than-expected forecast for earnings in the range of 94 cents to $1.20 a share.  \n Ford said it would update its outlook when it reports first-quarter results on April 28.  \n Also on Thursday, Ford said it would offer new-car buyers up to six months of payment relief. Some U.S. dealers have begun to see sales drop off because of the virus, which has already drastically hurt demand in other countries.

LAGOS/ABUJA - An Italian man who has been confirmed as Nigeria's first coronavirus case after arriving from Milan was in the country for almost two full days, travelling through Lagos and visiting another state before being isolated.  \n The case is the first in sub-Saharan Africa. Authorities fear the virus could spread quickly in a region where health systems are already overburdened with cases of malaria, measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases.  \n Lagos, with 20 million people, is the biggest city in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country. The West African country, with a population of some 200 million people, has a shortage of doctors and hospitals are often poorly maintained.  \n The Italian man works for cement company Lafarge Africa Plc <WAPCO.LG> in the southwestern state of Ogun, the company said in a statement. It said it had identified people who had \"direct contact\" with him before carrying out \"isolation, quarantine and disinfection protocol.\"  \n The Ogun state governor, in a separate media briefing, said 28 people had been placed in quarantine by the company the man worked for, although he did not mention it by name.  \n The case has prompted a scramble by Nigerian authorities to try to \"meet and observe\" all passengers who arrived on the same flight as the man and to identify the places he visited before being hospitalised.  \n \"We have started working to identify all the contacts of the person since he entered Nigeria and even those who were with him on the aircraft,\" Health Minister Osagie Ehanire told reporters on Friday in the capital, Abuja.  \n The Italian, whose country has been hit harder hit by the virus than any other in Europe, arrived on Feb. 24 on a Turkish Airlines flight that had a connection in Istanbul, said Lagos state commissioner for health, Akin Abayomi.  \n After spending the night in a hotel near the airport, he went on Feb. 25 to his place of work in neighbouring Ogun state, and stayed there until he developed a fever and body aches on the afternoon of Feb. 26, Abayomi told a news conference.  \n He was then transferred to a high containment facility in Yaba, Lagos state.  \n Ehanire said the infection was confirmed on Feb. 27 by the Virology Laboratory of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, and that the man was now quarantined and doing well.  \n Turkish Airlines did not immediately comment on the case. There are no confirmed cases in Turkey.  \n Nigerian stocks fell 1.63% to their lowest level in two months on Friday following the announcement of the coronavirus case.  \n The spread of the new coronavirus from China has hit global financial markets, and Nigeria's economy is at risk from the tumbling price of oil, which accounts for 90% of its foreign exchange earnings.  \n The latest World Health Organization figures indicate over 82,000 people have been infected, with over 2,700 deaths in China and 57 deaths in 46 other countries.  \n  \n LABORATORY NETWORK  \n Officials from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) are heading to Lagos to help address the case, and have activated its national Emergency Operations Centre.  \n International health organisation said they were working alongside their Nigerian counterparts.  \n Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said it is in contact with NCDC and is working with the WHO and other partners to support the Nigerian government's response.  \n In a statement it said it had deployed one epidemiologist to Nigeria to support assessment and response to the outbreak, and has shipped 1,000 COVID-19 laboratory test kits to the country.  \n And the WHO, which has said it already has experts in Nigeria, has identified Nigeria as one of 13 \"high priority\" countries in Africa. Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies programme, told a Geneva news conference on Friday that Nigeria had \"well-tested mechanisms for dangerous pathogens.\"  \n He said Nigeria was able to utilise a laboratory network that had been developed to handle cases of Lassa fever, monkeypox and influenza.  \n Schools and offices in Lagos provided hand sanitizer to people entering buildings on Friday.  \n \"There's a run on suppliers at the moment for hand sanitizer and masks,\" said Andrew Garza, chief operating officer of Lifestores Healthcare, a Lagos-based health technology company that provides inventory services to local pharmacies.  \n Garza said some stockists had sold out of hand sanitizer.  \n ($1 = 305.9200 naira) REUTERS \n "}, {"content": "what africa is doing to fight coronavirus.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) is not quick to declare global public health emergencies. \n From 2007 through 2019, the United Nations agency did so on only five occasions. The rapidly spreading new coronavirus that originated in December in China's Wuhan makes a sixth. \n The fallout from the organisation's Jan 30 call has spread rapidly. Four days later, the total number of countries placing border restrictions on Chinese travellers has surged to 60. They include Australia, India, Indonesia, Singapore, New Zealand, Russia and North Korea, and many countries have evacuated or are attempting to evacuate their citizens from Hubei province at the epidemic's epicentre. \n \"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems\" than China's, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet. \"I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern… not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries.\" \n The new coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, can lead to severe and often deadly pneumonia. Even as the number of infections and deaths rapidly mounted in Hubei's capital Wuhan and cases appeared in a growing number of other countries, the WHO took a deliberate approach to evaluating the danger. \n The agency's emergency committee, in meetings on Jan 22-23, initially decided not to designate it a global crisis pending collection of more data. A week later, the WHO declared the coronavirus the first global public health emergency originating in China. Such a designation did not apply to even the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic 17 years ago. \n A look at how the organisation reached its decision shows some of the inner workings of the global system for preventing and managing the spread of dangerous new diseases. \n The system relies on the rapid sharing of information among national health systems and the global public health organisation. Although some Chinese officials have drawn criticism internally and abroad for initially trying to downplay the crisis, the WHO's Dr Tedros maintains China was quick to share information, enhancing the global response. \n \"In many ways, China is setting a new standard for outbreak response,\" Dr Tedros said at a press conference. \"We would have seen many more cases outside China by now, and probably deaths, if not for the government's efforts.\" \n Data from China on the pathogen allowed Japan, South Korea and Thailand to diagnose similar cases quickly, he said. For example, a Chinese laboratory warned the German government of an infected person returning to Germany. \n Dr Tedros, an Ethiopian public health expert, arrived on Jan 27 in Beijing to meet Chinese officials. During his visit, President Xi Jinping called on the country to be transparent in working with the rest of the world and agreed to allow the WHO to send a group of international experts into the country to study the new strain of coronavirus alongside Chinese counterparts. \n Those data-gathering steps helped fill the information gap that kept the WHO's emergency panel from issuing its global warning sooner. \n Before the Jan 22-23 meetings, the lack of information on the virulence, infectiousness, severity and clinical symptoms of the coronavirus made reaching a consensus difficult, WHO emergency committee member John Mackenzie told media company Caixin. \n The global organisation had evidence of transmission of the virus within a household, but that is not unusual for a respiratory disease. The experts were looking for \"third-or fourth-generation infections\", referring to how many times a disease has been passed on, an indication of virulence. That evidence came quickly, laying the groundwork for the emergency committee to issue its global warning. \n Some argue that compared with the 2003 Sars crisis, the Chinese government has been much more transparent about the current coronavirus. \n \"Before we start pointing the finger at China, we need to recognise there are genuine sensitivities around sharing data around new diseases,\" said Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO's health emergencies programme who accompanied Dr Tedros to Beijing. \"I believe in this case the countries that have been affected, including China, have been remarkably transparent.\" \n According to US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, China's compliance with international health regulations and uploading of the genetic sequence of the virus enabled the Americans to develop a test kit to screen for infections. \n Under the WHO-administered International Health Regulations, a global public health emergency applies to \"an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response\". \n Since 2007, the WHO has declared public health emergencies in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the 2014 setbacks in global polio eradication efforts, the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic, the 2016 Zika virus outbreak and the 2018-2019 Kivu Ebola epidemic. \n The organisation's emergency committee, which makes the call, is made up of epidemiologists, virologists and infectious disease experts. Among them, at least one expert comes from the country where the epidemic began. \n The panel can also make recommendations to foreign governments on measures such as travel or trade restrictions. \n Even during serious crises, the WHO is conservative in its pronouncements. Through July last year, the Kivu Ebola epidemic killed 1,500 and infected more than 2,300 after appearing in the Democratic Republic of Congo in August 2018 and spread to nearby countries. The disease was not declared an international public health emergency until the WHO's fourth emergency committee meeting last July. \n Three factors weighed on the current WHO decision, according to Professor Didier Houssin, chairman of the WHO emergency committee. They were the rising number of cases in China, the growing number of countries with confirmed infections and the spread of questionable measures by some nations involving travellers. \n While the emergency committee does not encourage travel or trade restrictions, it acknowledges that such steps can be useful at times, such as when response capabilities are limited or when there is a large likelihood of infection among vulnerable groups. \n Under the International Health Regulations, countries are required to report travel restrictions to the WHO, and they are barred from taking steps that encourage discrimination. \n After news broke of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, many countries imposed increasingly stringent measures. In addition to posting travel warnings and tightening border controls, several counties implemented preliminary screening measures using their own public health organisations to diagnose those who may have come into contact with the virus even before they showed symptoms. \n The United States reacted especially quickly. On Jan 17, four days after Thailand reported its first case, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it would screen passengers arriving from Wuhan at major airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. At the time, the US had not reported any cases of the disease. After it did so, the country expanded screenings of Chinese passengers to 20 airports while also advising against all travel to China. \n Last Friday, the US declared the coronavirus epidemic a public health emergency and temporarily closed its borders to foreign nationals who had travelled to China in the previous two weeks and are not immediate family members of US citizens or permanent residents. The government also imposed mandatory two-week quarantines for those who were in China's Hubei province during that time span. \n As she confirmed Europe's first case of the coronavirus on Jan 24, French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn promised total transparency and daily updates to combat misinformation. She said sharing epidemic information with the public was the best barrier to its spread. \n Even though China shared the virus' genome sequence on Jan 11, researchers do not yet have a full grasp of its characteristics and routes of transmission, according to the WHO. \n Because developing a vaccine or treatment requires significant time and resources, all countries - including China and the US - should pool their efforts, said Dr Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), an international epidemiology group. \n Cepi, made up of public and private entities, said on Jan 23 that it was funding research into three separate efforts to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus with the aim of shortening development time to several months. \n The US National Institutes of Health started research on vaccines after receiving the virus' genetic sequencing, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Jan 20. He cautioned that the development process can last months or years, so controlling the epidemic will require \"traditional\" public health measures. \n So long as there is no vaccine, the only available measures for slowing the spread of the disease are quarantine, delaying resumption of work and schools and restricting travel, Dr Hatchett said last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He cautioned that the cost of these measures is high and difficult to sustain. \n From studying non-medical interventions in the 1980s, the US found that disease prevention is more effective when a city implements various interventions during the onset of an outbreak, Dr Hatchett said. \n As a US government public health official in 2005, Dr Hatchet helped draft the country's epidemic response plan in the light of the outbreak of the H5N1 influenza. \n • Xu Heqian, Wu Hongyuran, Qu Yunxu, Fu Lin, Zhang Qi, Chen Lixiong and Li Xin contributed to this article. \n • This article was first published by Caixin Global. \n "}, {"content": "Global downturn looms as countries struggle to contain coronavirus outbreak.

A report was made to the local and national CDCs on Jan 7, said Dr Zhong, who heads an expert task force to battle the coronavirus. \n \"But our CDC's status is too low. It is a technical department, and its significant role has not been given enough attention. The CDCs of many countries are directly connected to the central government and can even make public announcements directly.\" \n It was not until Jan 20 that President Xi Jinping made his first public comments on the outbreak, the same day Dr Zhong confirmed that the virus was being spread through human contact. \n Yesterday, Dr Zhong also suggested that while the outbreak first appeared in China, the virus may not have originated there. \n Meanwhile, reports that a prison in Wuhan released an infected inmate who later travelled to Beijing has caused an outcry and prompted Beijing to send in an investigation team. \n Netizens were outraged that the 61-year-old female inmate, who had completed her sentence, managed to slip through the city's lockdown, which has been in force for a month. \n Beijing health officials said the woman is now being treated at a hospital. She was among 300 or so inmates infected in the prison. \n Last week, prisons in Hubei, Shandong and Zhejiang provinces reported outbreaks totalling over 500, leading to the dismissals of their officials. \n In a meeting on Wednesday, Mr Xi warned officials not to rest on their laurels, even as numbers have improved overall. The situation in Hubei \"remains complex and grim, and the risk of a rebound of the epidemic in other regions cannot be overlooked\", official news agency Xinhua reported him as saying. \n Mr Xi and his six top lieutenants made personal donations to fight the coronavirus, which has reportedly cost the country over 100 billion yuan (S$20 billion). Xinhua did not report how much each of the leaders gave. \n "}, {"content": "Passageiros recusam partilhar avião com turistas de Wuhan que se medicavam contra a febre por temerem coronavírus.

KIRKLAND, Wash. - Doug Briggs put on a surgical gown, blue gloves and a powered respirator with a hood. He headed into the hospital room to see his mother - to tell her goodbye.  \n Briggs took his phone, sealed in a Ziplock bag, into the hospital room and cued up his mother's favourite songs. He put it next to her ear and noticed her wiggle, ever so slightly, to the music.  \n \"She knew I was there,\" Briggs recalled, smiling.  \n Between songs by Barbara Streisand and the Beatles, Briggs conference-called his aunts to let them speak to their sister one last time. \"I love you, and I'm sorry I'm not there with you. I hope the medicine they're giving you is making you more comfortable,\" said Meri Dreyfuss, one of her sisters.  \n Somewhere between \"Stand by Me\" and \"Here, There, and Everywhere,\" Barbara Dreyfuss passed away – her hand in her son's, clad in latex. It would be two days before doctors confirmed that she had succumbed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  \n Dreyfuss, 75, was the eighth U.S. patient to die in a pandemic that has now killed more than 1,200 nationally and nearly 25,000 worldwide. She was among three dozen deaths linked to the Life Care nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, the site of one of the first and deadliest U.S. outbreaks. (For interactive graphics tracking coronavirus in the United States and worldwide, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Uj9ry0 and https://tmsnrt.rs/3akNaFr )  \n Dreyfuss's final hours illustrate the heartrending choices now facing families who are forced to strike a balance between staying safe and comforting their sick or dying loved ones. Some have been cut off from all contact with parents or spouses who die in isolation, while others have strained to provide comfort or to say their final goodbyes through windows or over the phone.  \n Just three days before his mother died, Briggs had been making weekend plans with her. Now, in his grief, he found himself glued to news reports and frustrated by the mixed messages and slow response from local, state and federal officials.  \n \"You find out all these things, of what they knew when,\" Briggs said.  \n Officials from Life Care Centers of America have said the facility responded the best it could to one of the worst crises ever to hit an eldercare facility, with many staffers stretched to the brink as others were sidelined with symptoms of the virus. As the first U.S. site hit with a major outbreak, the centre had few protocols for a response and little help from the outside amid national shortages of test kits and other supplies.  \n   \n 'NOT FEELING TOO GOOD'  \n A flower child of the 1960's, Dreyfuss lived a life characterized by art and activism. After marrying her high school sweetheart and giving birth to their son, she pursued a degree in women's studies at Cal State Long Beach, where she marched for women's equality and abortion rights.  \n Furious over President Gerald Ford's pardoning of former president Richard Nixon in 1974, Dreyfuss took to her typewriter and penned an angry letter to Ford. \"Today is my son's 9th birthday,\" she wrote of a young Briggs. \"I do not feel like celebrating.\"  \n By the time she arrived at the Life Care Center in May 2019, years of health issues had dimmed some of that spark, her son said. Fibromyalgia and plantar fasciitis restricted her to a walker or a wheelchair, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease required her to have a constant flow of oxygen.  \n When her son visited on Feb. 25, he brought a grocery bag of her favourites, including diet A&W root beer. She awoke from a nap and smiled at him, but hinted at her discomfort.  \n \"Hi Doug,\" she said. \"I'm not feeling too good.\"  \n Still, Dreyfuss talked about an upcoming visit with her sisters - the movies she wanted to see, the restaurants she wanted to try. The mother and son then had only a vague awareness of the deadly virus then ravaging China.  \n In hindsight, Briggs realized he had witnessed the first signs of her distress. His mother was using more oxygen than usual, her breathing was more strained.  \n At the time, staff at the nursing home believed they were handling a flu outbreak and were unaware the coronavirus had started to take hold, a spokesman has said.  \n   \n 'A TINY FOOTNOTE'  \n Two days later, Briggs dropped by to see his mom. She felt congested, and staff were going to X-ray her lungs for fluid. Briggs, 54, still saw no red flags, and continued to discuss weekend plans with his mother.  \n \"I hope we can finally watch that new Mr. Rogers movie,\" she told him, referring to the film, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood.  \n Briggs hugged his mom before she was wheeled to the imaging room and drove for a quick meal. Soon after, he received a call from the nursing home. His mother was experiencing respiratory failure. She was on her way to the hospital. Doug rushed to nearby EvergreenHealth Medical Center. By then, she was unresponsive.  \n At the time, there were 59 U.S. cases of coronavirus, a number that has since soared to more than 85,000.  \n After hearing of her sister's sudden hospitalisation, Meri Dreyfuss remembered an earlier voicemail from Barbara: her distant voice, groaning for 30 seconds. When she had first heard it, she assumed Dreyfuss had called by accident, but now she realized her sister was in pain. \"It haunts me that I didn't pick up the phone,\" she said.  \n Briggs spent close to 10 hours the next day in his mom's hospital room. He wore a medical mask and anxiously watched her vital signs – especially the line tracking her oxygen saturation.  \n On his way out the door, a doctor took him aside to say they were testing her for the coronavirus. He remembered the difficulty reconciling the outbreak taking place on television - far away, in China - with what was happening in his mother's hospital room.  \n In the Bay Area, Meri and Hillary Dreyfuss were packing their suitcases on Feb. 28 when Briggs telephoned. After the call, they decided that visiting their sister would pose too much danger of infection.  \n \"I realized there was no way we were going to get on a plane at that point, because we couldn't see her,\" said the middle sister, Hillary. \"And now, it seemed that we shouldn't be seeing Doug, either.\"  \n They cancelled their flights. On Saturday, Feb. 29, Briggs learned his mother's condition was deteriorating. Tough decisions loomed. Briggs and his aunts decided to prioritise making her comfortable over keeping her alive. Doctors gave her morphine to relax the heaviness in her lungs.  \n She died the next day.  \n Having emerged from a two-week quarantine, Briggs will soon retrieve his mother's cremated remains. The family has been struggling with how to memorialize her life in such chaotic times.  \n \"All the things that one would want to happen in the normal mourning process have been subsumed by this larger crisis,\" said Hillary Dreyfuss. \"It's almost as though her death has become a tiny footnote in what's going on.\" REUTERS \n "}, {"content": "Coronavirus deaths eclipse global toll from Sars, but 'fewer unknowns' now about the virus. LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - The coronavirus disease spreading around the world has killed more than 810 people, exceeding the toll from the global outbreak of Sars that started in China almost two decades ago. \n Less than two months after surfacing in late December in Wuhan, China, cases of the coronavirus have topped 37,000. The fast-spreading disease long ago eclipsed the 8,100 total cases of Sars, which was transmitted worldwide in eight months, disrupting travel, industry and health care, and killing 774 people before coming under control. \n Both severe acute respiratory syndrome, or Sars, and the coronavirus are members of a larger family known to cause disease ranging from common colds to lethal infections. While both emerged from China before spreading to multiple countries, their paths have diverged in a number of significant ways. \n The rate of deaths among people infected with Sars was close to 10 per cent, said David Heymann, who oversaw the World Health Organization's (WHO) response to the outbreak, while it appears that rate in coronavirus will be below 2 per cent. An analysis of about 17,000 coronavirus patients showed that 82 per cent had mild cases, WHO officials said in a press briefing. \n \"You have to compare the two in perspective,\" Heymann said in an interview. The coronavirus outbreak \"could look more dramatic than it is.\" \n The number of cases and deaths from the new coronavirus may be far higher. The health system in Wuhan has been overwhelmed by the disease, with limited ability to care for every patient or diagnose new cases. Other cases may have been too mild to be counted by Chinese officials. \n \"I'm taking them for their word, but I really can't guarantee that they're reporting the right number. The only way you can guarantee it is if you go there and you monitor them,\" said Anthony S. Fauci, head of the US National Institute of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. US officials have been trying to get a team into China to better study the outbreak. \n The epidemic of Sars began in 2002 with a report of mysterious pneumonia in southern China's province of Guangdong. It shifted into a higher gear when it was amplified in hospitals and then, carried by international travellers, spread to 26 countries. \n Hospital workers were at particularly high risk, as so-called super-spreading events sickened multiple doctors and nurses. The outbreak was finally controlled by July 2003 with improved infection-control procedures and the WHO's recommendations to limit travel to areas where the outbreak was still out of control. \n While Sars infected and killed hundreds of people outside China, the newer virus, known as 2019-nCoV, has been mostly confined to the mainland, with all but two of the known fatalities there. Even as China has been lauded for its quick action and open communication regarding the outbreak, a number of unknowns continue to heighten concern about the disease. \n \"When you don't know your enemy, the fear of your enemy grows,\" said Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies programme, said on Friday at a press conference. \n Researchers still don't know exactly how the virus is spread. All signs point to droplet transmission, which means that small bits of fluid from the mouth and nose that carry the disease move from one person to the next, usually in face-to-face encounters. \n There's some evidence that people who aren't experiencing symptoms - coughing, sneezing, muscle pain - can also spread the virus. That means airport screeners, as well as patients themselves, stand little chance of finding infected people. Some researchers also think the disease might be spread through contaminated faeces, which was also the case with Sars and presents other prevention challenges. \n The severity of the coronavirus outbreak led to a lockdown of Wuhan city and Hubei province - with more than 58 million people - along with some other areas of China. The nation has become a virtual island as an increasing number of governments and airlines impose restrictions on travel from the mainland. \n The WHO hasn't recommended travel limits related to the coronavirus, but countries are desperately trying to keep the illness from their shores. Research on the new virus is moving quickly, and more may be known soon about how the disease spreads and how to stop it, Heymann said. \"There are already fewer and fewer unknowns,\" he said. \n "}, {"content": "BASF erwartet Belastungen wegen Coronavirus. \nDas neue Coronavirus wird nach Einschätzung des weltgrößten Chemiekonzerns BASF die Weltwirtschaft deutlich belasten. „In diesem Jahr erleben wir bereits in den ersten beiden Monaten eine hohe Unsicherheit in der Weltwirtschaft“, sagte BASF-Chef Martin Brudermüller am Freitag.\nMit dem Virus sei ein neuer Faktor hinzugekommen, der das Wachstum am Jahresanfang vor allem in China erheblich belaste. Folgen der Maßnahmen gegen die Ausbreitung des Virus seien eine geringere Nachfrage und Produktionsausfälle in vielen Branchen, sagte er bei Vorlage der Jahreszahlen.\nVor allem im ersten und zweiten Quartal rechnet BASF mit negativen Effekten. „Ich warne davor, zu früh Entwarnung zu geben, nur weil die Zahlen der Erkrankten in China zurückgehen“, unterstrich Brudermüller. Er erwarte nicht, dass die Coronavirus-Effekte im Jahresverlauf vollständig ausgeglichen werden können.\nFür das Gesamtjahr 2020 rechnet der Unternehmenschef damit, dass die Weltwirtschaft mit zwei Prozent deutlich langsamer wachsen wird als 2019. Auch für die globale Chemie erwartet er mit 1,2 Prozent deutlich geringere Zuwächse. „Das wäre das mit Abstand niedrigste Wachstum seit der Finanzkrise 2008/2009“, fügte Brudermüller hinzu.\n„Wenn ich das überschreiben müsste, würde ich unserer Mannschaft zuwerfen: Knie durchdrücken!“, sagte der BASF-Chef. „Wir machen jetzt einfach unsere Strategie, die ist richtig. Wir können das Umfeld nicht ändern. Aber wir können das Beste daraus machen.“\nAufgrund der noch ungewissen Folgen des Coronavirus hat BASF eine große Spanne für die Jahresziele angegeben - „Das zeigt die Unsicherheit“. Die Erlöse sollen 2020 auf 60 Milliarden Euro bis 63 Milliarden Euro steigen - nach 59,3 Milliarden Euro im vergangenen Jahr. Für das bereinigte Ergebnis vor Zinsen und Steuern (Ebit) peilt das Unternehmen 4,2 Milliarden Euro bis 4,8 Milliarden Euro an - nach einem Rückgang um 28 Prozent auf 4,5 Milliarden Euro 2019.\nFür 2019 will BASF etwas mehr Geld an die Aktionäre ausschütten als erwartet. Die Dividende soll um 10 Cent auf 3,30 Euro je Aktie erhöht werden. Der Gewinn nach Steuern und Minderheiten stieg 2019 im Jahresvergleich um knapp 80 Prozent auf 8,4 Milliarden Euro. Hier war aber ein Buchgewinn aus der Dekonsolidierung der Öl- und Gastochter Wintershall in Höhe von rund 5,7 Milliarden Euro enthalten.\n„2019 war ein herausforderndes Jahr mit starkem weltwirtschaftlichem Gegenwind“, sagte Brudermüller. Die Handelskonflikte zwischen den USA und China wirkten negativ, wichtige Absatzmärkte entwickelten sich langsamer. Dazu kämen Unsicherheiten im Zusammenhang mit dem Brexit. Die Nachfrage aus vielen wichtigen Kundenbranchen sei deutlich zurückgegangen, vor allem aus der Automobilindustrie.\nUm den Konzern profitabler zu machen, setzte der seit fast zwei Jahren amtierende Brudermüller Ende 2018 ein Sparprogramm auf. Dazu gehören Stellenstreichungen. Den Sparkurs habe BASF beschleunigt, sagte Brudermüller. Nun soll der Abbau von 6000 Stellen Ende 2020 erreicht werden, ein Jahr früher als geplant. Im vergangenen Jahr baute BASF weltweit bereits 3100 Stellen ab. Im Gegenzug plant BASF in den kommenden fünf Jahren Investitionen von 23,6 Milliarden Euro.\nIm vergangenen Jahr fusionierte die BASF ihre Öl- und Gastochter Wintershall mit dem Konkurrenten Dea. Das Unternehmen soll im zweiten Halbjahr in Frankfurt an die Börse gehen. „Wir bereiten einen Börsengang vor“, sagte BASF-Finanzchef Hans-Ulrich Engel. Ob er dann auch wie geplant kommt, sei aber von den Marktbedingungen abhängig.\nDie BASF-Mehrheitsbeteiligung Wintershall Dea steht wegen den Bau der umstrittenen Leitung Nord Stream 2 im Fokus. Wintershall Dea ist an der Pipeline, die Gas direkt von Russland über die Ostsee nach Deutschland transportieren soll, finanziell beteiligt. Das Projekt ist den USA ein Dorn im Auge. Deshalb drohen den Firmen, die an der Pipeline mitbauen, Sanktionen. Der Bau liegt derzeit auf Eis.\n„Es wird über Alternativen für die Fertigstellung von Nord Stream 2 nachgedacht“, sagte Engel. Nach dem Baustopp hatte Russland ein Spezialschiff für die Verlegung von Gasröhren in Bewegung gesetzt. Im Moment habe der Stopp keine konkreten Nachteile für Wintershall Dea, sagte Engel. Die Pipeline soll Ende 2020 fertiggestellt sein. (dpa)\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus effect on world economy grows more alarming.

O consulado geral de Portugal em Macau e Hong Kong aconselhou esta terça-feira a comunidade portuguesa a seguir as orientações das autoridades do território, no âmbito das medidas de prevenção face ao novo coronavírus chinês. Até agora, Macau registou dez casos confirmados de infeção.\n“O consulado geral de Portugal aconselha a comunidade portuguesa residente em Macau a seguir os conselhos e as orientações das autoridades de saúde pública da RAEM [Região Administrativa Especial de Macau]”, indica o cônsul geral, Paulo Cunha-Alves, num email enviado à Lusa.\nNo mesmo texto, o diplomata sublinhou que, apesar do encerramento dos serviços consulares, foi criado um piquete de atendimento para dar resposta aos casos mais urgentes. “Os serviços consulares estão encerrados ao público em geral desde o início das festividades do Ano Novo Lunar chinês.

Só se vão “manter os serviços urgentes”, com o objectivo principal de reduzir a circulação de pessoas, indicou. Ho Iat Seng admitiu ainda que o território está a ponderar encerrar as fronteiras com a China.\nO governante explicou que o encerramento das fronteiras é uma decisão difícil porque é necessário avaliar o impacto no fornecimento de alimentos ao território e porque adiciona constrangimentos à rotina diária de muitos residentes de Macau e de muitos trabalhadores do território que vivem na China.\n“Não estamos a encerrar nenhuma fronteira, não vão a correr comprar alimentos. Temos stock suficiente, não se preocupem”, assegurou.\nO responsável apelou ainda à população para que não saia de casa e “reduza ao máximo as actividades comerciais”. “Não posso mandar encerrá-los”, disse, sobre os espaços comerciais, mas “se não tiverem clientes, os próprios comerciantes vão decidir encerrar os negócios”, sustentou.\nContudo, pouco depois houve uma “corrida” aos supermercados. Em pelos menos seis destes espaços da ilha da Taipa, o cenário era o mesmo: corredores cheios de pessoas, filas enormes para efectuar o pagamento, com as pessoas, de máscara, a empurrarem carros de compras onde se encontravam empilhadas embalagens de carne, enlatados, sacos de arroz e garrafões de água.\nPor outro lado, era possível ver filas nas ruas para entrar em espaços que vendem congelados, que rivalizavam com outras que se mantêm há mais de uma semana para se adquirir máscaras de venda racionada nas farmácias.\nO Governo de Macau adquiriu ao todo 20 milhões de máscaras. Cada residente, mediante apresentação da identificação, recebe dez máscaras para igual número de dias.

As autoridades informaram que mais de 2,9 milhões de máscaras foram vendidas, desde o anúncio do primeiro caso de infecção em Macau, há duas semanas.\nQuantos aos desinfectantes, também esgotados em Macau, Ho Iat Seng sublinhou que não vai utilizar o mesmo método de racionamento para a população. “Não vamos garantir esse tipo” de produto para a população, afirmou. “Importante é nos hospitais e lares (...), esses têm de ser garantidos”, frisou, acrescentando que foram adquiridas quatro toneladas de produtos desinfectantes. “A prioridade é para os trabalhadores médicos (...), não queremos que médicos e enfermeiros sejam infectados”, reforçou.\nA conferência de imprensa para divulgar as medidas excepcionais teve lugar no dia em que Macau anunciou ter identificado o décimo caso de infecção no território e ter admitido a possibilidade de existir um surto comunitário, face ao cenário de um caso de contaminação local.\nA China elevou para 426 mortos e mais de 20.400 infectados o balanço do surto de pneumonia no país provocado por um novo coronavírus (2019-nCoV) detectado em Dezembro passado, em Wuhan, capital da província de Hubei (centro), que tem cidades sob quarentena, afectando cerca de 56 milhões de pessoas.\nHong Kong anunciou, esta manhã, a primeira morte relacionada com o coronavírus.\nO antigo território britânico suspendeu as ligações marítimas com Macau e fechou quase todas as fronteiras terrestres e marítimas com o continente para impedir a propagação do novo coronavírus.

Four more cases have been identified in a viral pneumonia outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan that has killed two people and prompted countries as far away as the United States to take precautionary measures./nThe latest cases bring to 45 the number of people who have contracted the illness, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said Saturday. Five are in serious condition, two died and 15 have been discharged. The others are in stable condition./nThe cause of the pneumonia has been traced to a new type of coronavirus. Health authorities are keen to avoid a repeat of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, another coronavirus that started in southern China in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800 people./nThe U.S. announced Friday that it would begin screening passengers at three major airports arriving on flights from Wuhan. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it would deploy 100 people to take the temperatures and ask about symptoms of incoming passengers at the Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City's Kennedy airports./nAt least a half-dozen countries in Asia have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China.

On March 24, while announcing a three-week preventive lockdown of the entire country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi allocated Rs 15,000 crore to boost the health infrastructure. The funds will be used to create additional hospital beds, build on the stockpile of COVID-19 testing kits and train medical practitioners. The Centre is putting in place protocols, including the acquisition of medical equipment and protection gear needed in the special isolation wards and facilities. A training protocol for frontline health workers is also being prepared.\nThe funds announced are a beginning. We would need more, depending on how soon we can end this affliction. Earlier, states were only using National Health Mission (NHM) funds. Now, they have access to a central fund, says Dr V.K. Paul, public health expert and a member of NITI Aayog. The first thing to do with the funds is equip hospitals, with personal protective gear, ventilators, additional oxygen, drugs and train staff. While isolation wards are being created, Dr Paul says COVID-specific facilities also need to be looked at for Stage 3. In Geneva, they are out of ICU (intensive care unit) beds. Such is the virulence of the disease at its peak. We need good hospitals that is where the focus is now. To support hospitals, we must also have isolation facilities, a strict surveillance system and should even consider setting up call centres in medical colleges, he says. Dr Paul maintains that India is still at Stage 2 (local transmission), but testing is being done more widely now.\nKerala, which has both an enduring healthcare system and a strong network of Panchayati raj bodies, is stealing a march on other states with its preparedness. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan says since a high number of people might need to be put under quarantine, local bodies have been instructed to identify hospitals, buildings, schools and auditoriums for the purpose. Even a minor lapse can prove disastrous, Vijayan cautioned office-bearers of local bodies during a video conference on March 19. If there is a spurt in cases, the existing facilities would not be enough to meet the requirements. Since the vast majority under observation would be home-quarantinedas people under special care’, Kerala’s strategy is to get the local bodies to take responsibility for local communities and ensure they do not face logistical problems while handling the situation.\n2 Dedicated COVID-19 hospitals and ICUs\nWith a hospital bed to population ratio of just 1:1,000 or around a million hospital beds in all, less than 100,000 ICU beds and only 40,000 ventilators at hand, India’s healthcare infrastructure is ill-equipped to face a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. Ventilators will be particularly critical. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in a report, said that about 5 per cent of COVID-19 patients may require intensive care, and half of those may need ventilator support.\nCOVID-19 impacts the lungs. In severe cases, the lungs fill up with fluid and it becomes hard to breathe. A ventilator ensures that the lungs do not collapse while the treatment is on, says Dr J.V. Divatia of the department of anaesthesiology, critical care and pain at Mumbai’s Tata Memorial Hospital. He warns of trouble if the patient numbers in India match those in China or Europe. There is no guideline on how many ventilators a hospital needs. In India, we keep about 20 per cent of beds for critical care, which is about enough in normal conditions, says Dr Divatia.\nMost high-end ventilators available in India are imported and cost Rs 5-12 lakh each. Hospitals say the quality of equipment made in the country isn’t as reliable. If orders are placed in advance, more ventilators can be bought and set up within a week. With little demand for their products at home, Indian manufacturers have been exporting ventilators. Ventilators manufactured by the Delhi-based Croyox Medical Service, costing Rs 4 lakh each, have been exported to Nepal, Thailand and Europe previously. Things changed on March 19 with the government’s ban on export of ventilators. It wants 100,000 simpler’ ventilators, customised for COVID-19 patients, installed across the country by April 30. Mysuru-based Skanray Technologies is being tasked to make 5,000 of these. Low-end ventilators could be an alternative if the COVID-19 symptoms are not very severe, says Dr Divatia.\nVentilator parts such as valves and sensors, though, are expected to remain in short supply. We will share the knowhow with others ready to make these customised ventilators so that the demand can be met as soon as possible, says Vishwaprasad Alva, managing director, Skanray Technologies. Experts also underscore the need to ensure adequate oxygen supplies in hospitals; many hospitals in Europe struggled to save COVID-19 patients as oxygen supplies ran out.\nAcross states, properties are being identified to transform them into dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. These could be defunct or upcoming hospitals or even hostels of educational institutions that can be converted into 250-300-bed facilities. The first such facility is a 100-bed centre set up by the Sir H.N. Reliance Foundation Hospital, Mumbai, at the 700-bed SevenHills Hospital in Andheri. Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, has pledged his Club Mahindra Resorts to serve as care centres for COVID-19 patients. He also said the group’s manufacturing units will see if they can manufacture ventilators. Hyderabad’s Owaisi Hospital and Research Centre is setting up an exclusive 100-bed centre.\nThe All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, which has about 1,300 doctors and 1,800 nurses on its rolls, has set up an isolation ward for COVID-19 cases. The institute has also freed up some 150 beds at its facilities in Jhajjar, Haryana. Regular meetings are being held to assess the situation and, on March 23, AIIMS suspended OPD (out-patient department) services as a precautionary measure.\nPlans for more isolation wards are being fine-tuned and will be reviewed by the ICMR in terms of protocol. This is among the steps being taken just in case the need arises, says Dr Indu Bhushan, CEO, National Health Authority (NHA). We are preparing ourselves should there be a [community-level] spread. That includes ensuring that private sector facilities support the treatment of COVID-19 cases. The NHA is assessing the capacity and readiness of private hospitals on this.\n3 Stimulus for domestic pharma\nThe abrupt stoppage in the flow of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), mostly from China, is impacting the Indian pharmaceutical sector, with fears now of a potential shortage of bulk drugs and intermediates. A corpus fund to incentivise Indian pharma companies is one way to encourage domestic production of APIs. The central department of pharmaceuticals has asked the Union ministry for environment, forest and climate change to waive the environmental impact assessment reports for projects by some categories of pharma firms. This, it is felt, will help reduce the time required to manufacture bulk drugs and APIs locally. The Centre has also pledged Rs 10,000 crore towards the production of critical drugs and another Rs 4,000 crore to promote manufacturing of medical equipment in the country.\nThe ICMR’s announcement on March 23 that the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine could be used as a preventive drug by COVID-19 high-risk groups (health workers or household members of patients) has led to a scramble, with chemists reporting that stocks are running out. In Mumbai, most shops are out of stock. Doctors have been trying a combination of drugs, which worked for other infections, to treat COVID-19 symptoms. If this drug is proven to work, we would have a need for it, says Dr C.S. Pramesh, director, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai.\nFollowing US president Donald Trump’s endorsement of hydroxychloroquine, Indian pharma companies Ipca and Zydus Cadila received bulk orders of the drug from the US. Even though India has a strong foothold in the production of hydroxychloroquine and pharma experts say production can be ramped up any time, there is already a noticeable shortage because of hoarding. While the government is planning to stockpile about 2 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, ensuring smooth supplies will also require a ban on its export, like the UK has done, as well as on over-the-counter sale.\n4 Reliable testing kits\nAs of 10 am, March 25, India had tested 22,928 samples for COVID-19, according to ICMR. This includes more than 500 random sample tests. The governing body for testing in India had come under fire for limiting the testing criteria in the initial days of the outbreak to those who had travelled to countries affected by the virus or had come in close contact with a COVID-19 patient. While about 300,000 test kits were available, only about 9,000 samples had been tested in the first week of March. Without data, it is hard to gauge the extent of the spread or make projections on the course the disease will take. Testing can slow down the disease, says K. Sujatha Rao, former Union health secretary.\nOn March 20, ICMR expanded the testing criteria to include even those who showed flu-like symptoms but had not travelled to countries reporting an outbreak of the disease. Two days later, it was announced that private labs would be granted licences for testing and orders would be placed with Indian companies to produce COVID-19 test kits. Private labs, however, say it is too early to comment on whether they can start testing since quality-compliant kits are not freely available. Also, the countrywide lockdown has crippled public transport, affecting staff strength in the labs.\nDr Navin Dang, founder of Dr Dang’s Labs (one of the private facilities approved for testing), favours widespread testing. A few kits might be lost, but lives are also saved, he says. An ideal situation would be one like South Korea where mass testing is possible, where anyone with symptoms can be tested and isolated if needed. Dr Dang, however, discourages home tests. Self-assessment is not advisable as it is not reliable. The COVID-19 test has highly specific guidelines, nose and throat swabs are collected in protective packing and tested in labs with a biosafety level of 2 and above and a real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) system. Trained personnel are needed for it, he says.\nThe Centre has capped the pricing of the test at Rs 4,500 and urged private labs to conduct the test free of cost, if possible. It has also mandated that only US Food and Drug Administration and European CE certified test kits be used. Pune-based Mylab Discovery Solutions, the first home company to get commercial approval for manufacturing the test kits, has produced indigenous kits that give results faster (in 2.5 hours as opposed to the standard 7 hours) and are cheaper (the company wants to price it around Rs 1,500). While ICMR has ordered about 200,000 kits from Germany, MyLab claims it can produce that many in a week. Its test kits, though, are yet to acquire international certifications. For me, quality is everything and I will not start testing till the time I am able to procure high-quality test kits. We cannot afford misdiagnosis at this stage, says Dr Dang.\n5. Lessons from home-quarantine\nFrom a COVID-19 positive man in Telangana, who hosted 1,000 guests at his wedding, to a London-returnee in Kolkata who repeatedly evaded testing, to the wife of a COVID-19 patient who escaped from quarantine and boarded a train to Agra, India’s fight against coronavirus is being thwarted by cases of individuals fleeing isolation. Who says COVID-19 cannot affect young people? It can. There have been severe symptoms in the youth too. Fewer, but it cannot be ruled out, says Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman and managing director, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram. Those who are old or immunocompromised are high-risk. Recovery is also slower for them. The lungs get damaged a bit in severe cases, and this can impact long-term cardiovascular health, though we don’t know exactly how yet. Dr Trehan says that COVID-19 being a new disease, it is hard to predict who will get sick and in what manner. Those breaking quarantine because they feel they are going to get only mild symptoms and will be fine are wrong. They are putting everyone at risk.\nWhile states like Maharashtra are hand-stamping quarantined patients, to allow easy detection in case they step out in public, Kerala has adopted a home-quarantine model that relies more on community support than coercive measures. It is very difficult to convince people to stay at home for two weeks. We had been constantly contemplating how people could be dissuaded from breaking the rules of quarantine without having to punish’ them, says Dr Amar Fettle, nodal officer for public health emergencies in Kerala’s health department. The state has close to 53,000 people under home quarantine. Dr Fettle credits this to community outreach. We have 30,000 Accredited Social Health Activists and 15,000 field workers, who visit homes and educate people on the importance of isolation and social distancing, he says.\nThe state health department also makes surprise calls twice daily to check in on those in quarantine. The calls make note of the medical and other supplies they may be in need of, which are then arranged for through the primary health centres or panchayats. We realised that when you let people know that you are working with them, and not merely enforcing rules, they are more willing to listen, adds Dr Fettle. There are the odd defaulters in Kerala as well, but few.\n6. Defeating fake news\nAnother challenge is to curb the fake news circulating on COVID-19 and counter it with a credible information source. Telangana is rolling out one such digital solution to fight the misinformation. We are planning a WhatsApp number, on which people can get [COVID-19-related] messages verified, a website as well as an archive of fact-checked information, says Dileep Konatham, director, digital media, Telangana government. There have also been instances of misreporting by local electronic media, such as quarantined individuals undergoing tests being reported as new COVID-19 cases, only to retract the news within a few hours without even a hint of an apology. Determined to come down hard on such misinformation, Telangana has invoked Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which stipulates imprisonment and fine for circulating false alarms/warnings’ related to disasters.\nThe AIIMS staff has been among the victims of misinformation. On March 24, a circular from the hospital mentioned how members of its staff living on rent were being harassed or evicted by home-owners over fears that they would pass on the infection. Myths help COVID-19 spread. Doctors must be supported, not stigmatised, says Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, adding that the pandemic is a daily evolving scenario. COVID-19 is a serious threat. Hospitals are taking steps to cope with the high numbers. The public needs to play a part too. If we are responsible today, it could stop the spread.\n7. Strengthening the healthcare force\nWith an estimated 0.62 doctors per thousand people, as opposed to the WHO ideal of 1 per thousand, India’s healthcare sector looks acutely under-staffed in the fight against coronavirus. According to Dr Devi Prasad Shetty, founder of the Narayana Health chain of hospitals, round-the-clock treatment of 2,000 patients in an ICU would require an estimated 2,800 nurses, 800 resident doctors and 400 anaesthetists. At the time of community transmission in China’s Wuhan (a city of 11 million), 9,689 patients were severe and needed to be admitted to an ICU. Going by Dr Shetty’s estimate, attending to, say, 9,600 patients in Delhi (a city of 18 million) will require the services of 13,440 nurses and 3,840 doctors. Last year, it was reported that Delhi has 4,644 sanctioned (not necessarily filled) posts for doctors while the Delhi Nursing Council puts the number of registered nurses in the city at about 7,000.\nTo bridge the shortfall, Dr Shetty recommends that postgraduate students of medicine be given the option by their institutions to serve at COVID-19 ICUs and wards as part of their training. He also suggests that the Indian Nursing Council permit final-year nursing students to take care of stable’ patients while young doctors trained overseas be given temporary licences to work under senior doctors in India. The government also needs to ensure the safety of healthcare workers. Doctors should be given personal protective equipment for practice runs and COVID-19 ICU simulations should be set up to teach them the safe practices, says Dr Shetty.\n8. A protocol for safe funerals\nIn Italy, mounting fatalities prompted the authorities to call in the army for safe disposal of bodies. As with other contagious diseases, there is a strict protocol in place for cremation/ burial of COVID-19 patients to minimise the risk of spreading infection. In India, in the absence of guidelines, there have been reports of crematoriums refusing to handle bodies of COVID-19 victims. In Delhi, the family of a woman who succumbed to the disease had to run from pillar to post for hours before the city’s largest crematorium let in her body for the last rites. According to officials at Chennai’s Kalyan Hospital, the role of the hospital ends with cleaning and securing a COVID-19 victim’s body in a body bag, and the local administration needs to take over from thereon. A protocol that ensures the timely, hassle-free and respectful funeral of COVID-19 victims is urgently required.\n9. Ensuring the sick know what to do\nThe protocol for treatment in Germany bans hospital walk-ins. Those who feel they have symptoms are forced to stay at home, dial a number, which can take 40-50 minutes to connect, and wait for a doctor to call back to see whether or not their condition is serious enough to be treated. This has led to severe psychological stress for patients, many of whom have gone on social media to share their stories. To avoid such a situation in India, a clear guideline needs to be designed so that individuals with COVID-19 symptoms know what to do. Examples from Italy point to the fact that the infection spread a lot more through people-to-people contact in hospitals. Italian doctors have emphasised that COVID-19 should be treated at home as much as possible.\nGoa is creating an app that guides a person on the next steps to take based on a self-assessment of symptoms. But as cases rise, this may not be enough. Some projections point to 300,000 cases soon. If that happens, India would collapse, as would any country, says Rao. She is, however, hopeful that the situation will remain manageable. We are already one of the five countries to have isolated the virus strain. We should be coming up with a standardised procedure or guidelines soon. At this point, meticulous planning will save the day. Those who are sick should be assisted with the least amount of waiting period, says Rao.\n"}, {"content": "World wary of coronavirus even as cases drop; Chinese drug trial results weeks away. BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - The Chinese province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak reported a record rise in deaths and thousands more infections using a broader definition on Thursday, while Japan became the third place outside mainland China to suffer a fatality.\nThe epidemic has given China’s ruling Communist Party one of its sternest challenges in years, constrained the world’s second largest economy and triggered a purge of provincial bureaucrats.\nWith China’s streets, restaurants and flower markets bare, a miserable Valentine’s Day was expected on Friday.\nJapan confirmed its first coronavirus death - a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo - adding to two previous fatalities in Hong Kong and the Philippines. For all related coverage on the outbreak, click: here\nFor related Reuters graphics on the new coronavirus, click: tmsnrt.rs/2GVwIyw\nJapan is one of the worst affected of more than two dozen other countries and territories that have seen hundreds of infections from the flu-like sickness.\nThe Japanese woman fell ill in January but only later showed symptoms of pneumonia and was hospitalized, with coronavirus confirmed after her death and the contagion route under investigation, the health minister said.\nHowever, the big jump in China’s reported cases reflects a decision by authorities there to reclassify a backlog of suspected cases by using patients’ chest images, and is not necessarily the “tip of an iceberg” of a wider epidemic, a top World Health Organization official said on Thursday.\nMike Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies program, said that more than 14,000 new cases reported in Hubei province overnight came after a change to include results from quicker computerized tomography (CT) scans that reveal lung infections, rather than relying just on laboratory tests to confirm cases.\n“We’ve seen this spike in the number of cases reported in China, but this does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,” Ryan told a briefing in Geneva.\nThe biggest cluster of infections outside China is on a cruise liner now quarantined off a Japanese port and a further 44 cases were reported on board on Thursday, raising the total to 219. But authorities said some elderly people would finally to be allowed to disembark on Friday.\n“Outside the cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship we are not seeing a dramatic increase in transmission outside China,” the WHO’s Ryan said.\nHe added that the main U.N. health agency expected the rest of a special WHO team to arrive in China over the coming weekend to investigative the epicenter of the epidemic.\nU.S. President Donald Trump praised China over its response and said Washington was working closely with Beijing. “I think they’ve handled it professionally, and I think they’re extremely capable,” Trump said in a podcast broadcast on iHeart Radio.\nBut Trump’s top White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, was more critical. “We’re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese, these numbers are jumping around... there was some surprise,” he told reporters.\nIn central China’s Hubei province, officials said 242 people died on Wednesday, the biggest daily rise since the flu-like virus emerged in the provincial capital Wuhan in December.\nTotal deaths in China are 1,367.\nThe rise, following a forecast earlier this week by China’s senior medical adviser that the epidemic might end there by April, halted a global stocks rally. [MKTS/GLOB]\nBut it appeared largely due to the change in methodology.\nHubei had previously only allowed infections to be confirmed by RNA tests, which can take days. RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries genetic information allowing identification of viruses.\nBut it has also begun using CT scans of lungs, the Hubei health commission said, to pinpoint and isolate cases faster.\nAs a result, another 14,840 new cases were reported in the province on Thursday, up from 2,015 new cases nationwide a day earlier. But excluding cases confirmed using the new methods, the number of new cases rose by only 1,508.\nAbout 60,000 people have been infected in total, the vast majority of them in China.\nThe outbreak, believed to have emerged from a Wuhan market where wildlife was traded illegally, has triggered a backlash against local political leaders.\nProvincial Communist Party boss Jiang Chaoliang was fired as secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee, and Ma Guoqiang removed as party chief in Wuhan, state media said. They were the two highest-profile officials to be axed since the outbreak.\nChinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are weeks away, although WHO chiefs have cautioned a vaccine could take 18 months.\nWhile the Princess Diamond cruise liner remained in quarantine, another luxury liner, the MS Westerdam, was finally allowed to dock in Cambodia after being barred from Guam, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand over fears that one of its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus - even though none had tested positive.\nThe Westerdam’s passengers clapped and cheered on their arrival at sunset.\n"}, {"content": "a chinese director and 3 of his family members passed away after getting infected with covid-19. Chinese director Chang Kai has passed away at the age of 55 after contracting COVID-19, sparking anger across China after his last words were revealed. The Hubei native had alleged that his elderly father was refused treatment after falling ill and eventually passed away at home after being turned away by numerous medical institutions. His mother and older sister have also passed away after being infected with the virus. \n In his last words, Chang Kai shared that he and his father came down with a fever, started coughing and had breathing difficulties on January 25. He went to various hospitals to seek treatment, but was turned away as he was told that there were no available beds. He returned home, but succumbed to the disease two days later. \n Chang Kai’s mother, who was looking after her husband before his passing, was also infected. She was sent to the hospital on February 4 after her condition deteriorated, and passed away on the same day. \n Unfortunately, both the director and his wife, who were caring for the two elderly folk, also tested positive for COVID-19. They were said to have pleaded with numerous hospitals and clinics to treat them, but were only admitted when their respective conditions deteriorated. Chang Kai passed away in the wee hours of February 14 at the Wuhan Huangpi People’s Hospital, whereas his wife is still fighting the sickness.  \n The director’s sister, who does not live with them, also passed away on February 14 after being infected too. It's said that she was present at the reunion dinner that the family had on January 24 — the day before Chang Kai’s father showed symptoms.  \n Chang Kai leaves behind his only son, who is currently studying in England. He was said to have been told by his family to not come home after the outbreak in Hubei, and it is not known if he would be able to pay his last respects to his father as the Hubei province is still under lockdown.  \n Netizens have voiced their anger over the news on Weibo, with many asking for health officials to be more transparent with updates. “Do you really expect entire families to die just like that?” one wrote. Another added, “It’s one thing to die knowing that you were given the best treatment, but it’s a whole different thing to know that you weren’t even given a fighting chance.” \n "}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Ramdas Athawale chants Go Corona, Corona Go.

María Guadalupe Guzmán Tirado, Jefa del Centro de Investigación, Diagnóstico y Referencia del IPK\nEl doctor Francisco Durán García, director nacional de Epidemiología del Ministerio de Salud Pública (Minsap), actualizó sobre la evolución más reciente en el mundo del nuevo coronavirus SARS CoV-2, causante de la peligrosa y contagiosa enfermedad de la Covid-19.\nFoto: Captura de pantallaExpresó que desde que en diciembre de 2019 se detectaron los primeros casos en la ciudad china de Wuhan, la progresión ha sido muy rápida.\nExplicó que las últimas cifras sitúan en 144 el número de naciones con al menos un caso, y que existen más de 180 000 infectados y más de 7 000 fallecidos, según los últimos datos divulgados este martes.\nEl doctor Durán García destacó el esfuerzo de China para detener el virus y señaló que fuera de ese país se contabilizan más de 98 000 contagiados con una tasa de mortalidad del 4%, por encima de lo registrado en China en el momento más intenso de la infección.\nSobre la situación en la Isla, confirmó la presencia de dos nuevos casos de la Covid-19 en Cuba, con lo cual suman siete pacientes diagnosticados con esa enfermedad.\nPuntualizó que en casi todos los contagios se mantiene la característica de que han sido por contacto con algún infectado extranjero.\n«No podemos hablar de que existe transmisión en el país, porque eso ocurrirá cuando empecemos a encontrar personas con presencia del virus, con o sin síntomas, que no hayan tenido relación con alguno de los pacientes infectados llegados del extranjero o con vínculos con ellos. Nos preparamos para esa situación», apuntó.\nSignificó que en Cuba, desde el mes de enero se preparó el plan de prevención y control de la epidemia y, desde entonces, ha venido realizando un grupo de acciones con la conducción de las principales autoridades nacionales de todo el territorio, pues esta enfermedad requiere de la intersectorialidad.\nEl Director Nacional de Epidemiología del Minsap agregó que a este plan se le fueron incorporando conocimientos en diferentes características clínicas, epidemiológicas y tratamientos.\nEn nuestro país, existe la ventaja de no tener frontera terrestre y con un buen control, se minimizaba el riesgo de que entrara, porque puede que la persona este incubando la enfermedad y no se detecta a la hora de la entrada.\nDesde el inicio se adoptó la medida de aislar a las personas con características de esta enfermedad en los centros previstos, lo que permitió mantener una vigilancia estrecha a un número de casi 25 mil personas en la atención primaria y cualquiera que viniera de las naciones de riesgo de esta pandemia.\nINFORMAN DE DOS NUEVOS CASOS CON COVID-19, POR LO QUE SUMAN SIETE LOS CONTAGIADOS EN CUBA\nInformó que en el día de hoy el laboratorio del Instituto de Medicina Tropical (IPK) Pedro Kourí confirmó el diagnóstico del séptimo caso en Cuba, donde casi todos han sido personas que han venido de países de transmisión y dos de ellos, quienes han tenido contactos muy estrechos con personas procedentes del exterior.\nSobre la cuarentena, precisó que «esta medida se establece en cada país en la medida en que se va complejizando la situación del mismo, no la internacional».\nCuando se adoptan las medidas establecidas y se tienen un grupo de casos que no evidencia la transmisión de la enfermedad, la cuarentena no se justifica, aclaró.\nDe igual forma, explicó que los cierres de centros laborales y docentes crean una situación de tensión y estrés, procesos que se saben disminuye las capacidades inmunológicas del cuerpo y representa más riesgo.\nEl país está consciente de ello y en los últimos días se han tomado medidas para evitar las aglomeraciones, aseveró\n\n¿POR QUÉ EN CUBA NO SE HAN ESTABLECIDO MEDIDAS EXTREMAS?\nAl comentar por qué no se han establecido en Cuba medidas extremas como la cuarentena, explicó que esta la asume cada país en dependencia de sus características. La Organización Mundial de la Salud establece las medidas por etapas.\nEl especialista reiteró que ninguno de los casos detectados en Cuba ha sido por transmisión, sino por haberse contagiado en el exterior.\n«La cuarentena se establece en dependencia de la transmisión y en este momento no se justifica. Trabajamos por no llegar a ese momento», aseguró.\nIndicó que tampoco es prudente el cierre de escuelas o centros de trabajo hasta que no haya transmisión en el país.\n«Cuando no hay transmisión evidente y cierras escuelas, se crea una tensión extra y disminuye la capacidad inmunológica. Cuba está atenta y se ha hecho público que un grupo de actividades con grandes concentraciones de población se han suspendido», subrayó.\nCUBA Y LAS INFECCIONES AGUDAS RESPIRATORIAS\nMaría Guadalupe Guzmán Tirado, jefa del Centro de Investigación, Diagnóstico y Referencia del IPK, hizo referencia a las infecciones respiratorias agudas (IRA), de manera general, las cuales, alegó la especialista, constituyen la causa de muerte de tres y cinco millones de personas en el mundo, aun cuando en eso influyen también el mal uso de antibióticos y otras circunstancias menores.\n«Es decir que son conocidas históricamente nos hemos enfrentado a este tipo de padecimiento, que en su mayoría son virales, y los acompaña en ocasiones un uso inadecuado de antibióticos, además de la confusión por las similitudes de los síntomas, como la neumonía, la bronconeumonía, etc», alertó.\nDijo que Cuba no escapa a esa realidad, las IRA son la primera causa de muerte por infecciones en nuestro país, pero también son motivo de hospitalización y en muchos casos de uso incorrecto de antibióticos, pues la mayoría son virales, aunque las infecciones bacterianas también pueden producirlas. Generan, además, ausentismo escolar y laboral.\nEntre las IRA, refirió, los virus ocupan un lugar principal y causan una amplia gama de síntomas que van desde la rinitis, el resfriado común y los que afectan el tracto inferior como la neumonía, la bronconeumonía y bronquiolitis en niños pequeños. Diferentes virus pueden producir la misma sintomatología.\nAl respecto, destacó que hablamos de virus como el de la influenza A, que conmocionó al mundo en 2009, el de la influenza B, los de la parainfluenza, el enterovirus D68, entre otros virus emergentes, y también los coronavirus.\n\nSEGUIMIENTO DE LAS INFECCIONES RESPIRATORIAS POR EL SISTEMA CUBANO DE CUBANA\nLa Jefa del Centro de Investigación, Diagnóstico y Referencia del IPK señaló que los coronavirus son un grupo viral muy conocido, identificado en la década de 1930, que afecta a muchos animales como aves, murciélagos, conejos, caballos, ratones y cerdos, produciendo cuadros respiratorios y de diarrea, incluso neurológicos.\nEn la década de 1960 fue reconocido un grupo de coronavirus, que afectan al hombre y pasan a ser zoonosis. Existen cuatro fundamentales y todos son vigilados por Cuba.\nEn estos momentos se realiza un seguimiento más proactivo de los mismos ante esta emergencia mundial, pero el seguimiento de las infecciones respiratorias virales y bacterianas es cotidiano en el sistema nacional de salud, destacó.\n«El cuidado personal solo lo puede hacer correctamente cada persona», puntualizó.\nLa doctora Guzmán Tirado explicó que los coronavirus son «virus envueltos, blandos, virus RNA. Por esas características es que se habla tanto de lavarse las manos o utilizar cloro o alcohol como parte del cuidado personal para combatirlos, pues son susceptibles a esas soluciones.\n«El cuidado personal solo lo puede hacer correctamente cada persona. Cuando alguien estornuda y está con un cuadro respiratorio, podemos contagiarnos con cualquiera de los virus, si tocamos alguna puerta de entrada como la boca, los ojos o la nariz. «De ahí la necesidad del lavado frecuente de las manos.\n«Sin embargo, el coronavirus surgido a finales de 2019 en Wuhan es nuevo y ya se conoce que tiene alta similitud con el SARS aislado en murciélagos, que son reservorios de diferentes virus».\nRecordó que en 2009 tomó fuerza el MERS con una elevada mortalidad de entre el 30 y 35%, pero localizado en la zona del Mediterráneo oriental. A su vez, en 2012, el SARS tuvo en China un 9% de letalidad y se comportó como un cuadro grave.\nSobre el nuevo coronavirus, por su similitud al virus del SARS del murciélago, la especialista del IPK abundó que si bien es posible que haya un huésped intermedio no reconocido aún, es muy probable que tuviese su origen en los murciélagos.\n«Por sus espículas, parecidas a una corona cuando se observan a través del microscopio electrónico, es que recibe el nombre de coronavirus».\nFoto: Captura de pantallaCUBA CUENTA CON LA TECNOLOGÍA NECESARIA PARA REALIZAR EL TEST QUE DETECTA LA COVID-19\nPor su parte, la doctora María Guadalupe Guzmán Tirado, jefa del Centro de Investigación, Diagnóstico y Referencia del IPK, explicó que las infecciones respiratorias agudas son una causa de entre tres a cinco millones de muertes en el mundo, y Cuba no escapa de eso. Las mismas pueden causar una serie de síntomas que varían según el tipo, por lo que diferentes virus pueden producir una misma sintomatología.\nDe acuerdo con la especialista este coronavirus se diagnostica a través del exudado nasofaríngeo, test que conlleva una tecnología nada barata, que puede costar hasta 50 dólares y que tenemos en el país, no solo en el IPK, sino también en Villa Clara y en Santiago de Cuba. «También tenemos los reactivos, el personal especializado, los laboratorios, el equipamiento, etc...», dijo.\nSobre el IPK, la doctora destacó que tiene tres grandes funciones: la investigación de enfermedades infecciosas, el servicio especializado, y la docencia. Este centro asume a los pacientes infectados y sospechosos de Covid-19 siguiendo los protocolos de la OMS, de la experiencia China y de la experiencia del país.\nEn el caso de la docencia, ya se ha capacitado el personal del Sistema de Salud y de otros organismos de Cuba, o sea de diferentes sectores, así como a los propios entrenadores que se encargaran de impartir el conocimiento en otros centros.\nIgualmente, se mantiene el intercambio con científicos de otras partes, así como con organizaciones internacionales de salud, no solo para el enfrentamiento del coronavirus, sino de otras enfermedades. Por esa colaboración, la especialista agradeció la solidaridad hacia Cuba.\n\nSOBRE EL DIAGNÓSTICO DEL NUEVO CORONAVIRUS\nEl diagnóstico de este coronavirus, dijo que se hace a través de un exudado nasofaríngeo, que es donde encontramos partículas del virus a través de técnicas moleculares de avanzada, lo que se conoce como PCR en tiempo real, una tecnología empleada para identificar diferentes tipos de virus.\n«Son métodos modernos y costosos. Un test de PSR en tiempo real puede costar entre 40 y 50 dólares, aseguró.\nAñadió que esta tecnología se encuentra disponible en el país, tanto en el IPK, como en tres laboratorios ubicados en los centros provinciales de higiene y epidemiología de La Habana, Villa Clara y Santiago de Cuba.\nFoto: Captura de pantalla\nPARA UNA ATENCIÓN MÁS ESTRECHA EN LA COMUNIDAD\nPablo Feal Cañizares, director de la Unidad de Promoción de Salud y Prevención de Enfermedades (Prosalud), comentó que en Cuba se ejecutan acciones propias del sistema de salud para proteger a las personas. Expresó que ese plan se adecúa a la experiencia sanitaria del país y de otros en el mundo.\nDijo que los consultorios del médico de la familia y los policlínicos se han ido organizando para dar una atención más estrecha. La principal tarea en marcha es la identificación de los grupos vulnerables, tales como personas con más de 60 años o con enfermedades respiratorias, los que viven solos y los hogares de ancianos.\nArgumentó que, además de las acciones de desinfección, se ha reforzado la pesquisa activa por el médico de la familia, dando prioridad a este grupo, y buscando síntomas respiratorios con el objetivo de adoptar medidas inmediatas.\nEl plan contempla la certificación de cada proceso, dijo, al tiempo que explicó que tras realizar acciones de capacitación en todo el país, ahora corresponde un entrenamiento más especializado.\n\nACUDIR AL MÉDICO ANTE CUALQUIER SÍNTOMA\nSobre el plan de comunicación, agregó Pablo Feal Cañizares que se ha logrado una mayor participación de la población. Los medios de prensa nacionales han aportado información oportuna, verídica, insistiendo en el riesgo, pero sin crear pánico.\n«Lo fundamental es transmitir confianza, seguridad y la necesidad de que los cubanos se protejan».\nA la par se han creado materiales educativos que se transmiten por los medios de comunicación, mientras aumenta la participación intersectorial. Cada organismo tiene una tarea, puntualizó.\nEl especialista aconsejó que ante cualquier síntoma respiratorio, se debe acudir al médico cuanto antes, así como hay que evitar salir del país, y en caso de viajar y regresar, ser chequeados por las autoridades sanitarias.\n«Lo más importante es que los cubanos mantengan cuidado, con responsabilidad y prudencia», manifestó.\nEl lavado de manos, reiteró, es la medida más efectiva para prevenir esta enfermedad. En cuanto a los nasobucos, exhortó a la solidaridad de los cubanos, teniendo en cuenta que pueden ser confeccionados en las propias casas. “La producción industrial está enfocada en garantizar las mascarillas del personal que está directamente expuesto a los contagiados o sospechosos, como los médicos».\n[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument> <w:View>Normal</w:View> <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom>

SINGAPORE — The Covid-19 situation is forcing businesses to think even harder about diversification — from making sure that their supply of labour comes from different countries, to housing their foreign workers in different dormitories, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing. \n His comments came after a two-hour dialogue with about 25 corporate leaders in Singapore on Friday (Feb 14), where they aired their concerns about the impact that the virus has had on their businesses. \n Mr Chan told reporters that the outbreak has mainly affected tourism-related sectors, the food and beverage sectors and the retail sectors but there are some sub-sectors that are still holding up pretty well. \n For other sectors, such as manufacturing, Mr Chan said the business leaders are not only concerned about the potential disruptions to the supply chain from China, but also the supply chains that come indirectly from China to the rest of the world and to Singapore. \n Business leaders also cited short term cash flow as being another concern, he said, although they added that they are taking steps to diversify their sources of supply chains and labour. \n He noted that because of the United States-China trade war last year, some companies had already begun undertaking measures to diversify their supply chains and it is likely that the Covid-19 outbreak will push more businesses to do the same. \n With regard to the supply of labour, Mr Chan said the business leaders agreed that there is a need to reassess where their manpower comes from so that they can avoid relying on a particular country for labour. \n However, Mr Chan added that the more pressing issue for local businesses is ensuring that their workers do not all stay in the same dormitories. \n “Some of the companies, especially the smaller ones, might conveniently house their workers all at the same place. \n “But that is not a very resilient business continuity plan and I think we want to help many of these smaller companies to diversify their supply chain and mitigate these risks at the local level.” \n To mitigate the problem of cash flow, Mr Chan said that business leaders can do their part by helping each other tide through the challenging times. \n “The larger contractors must not withhold payment from the smaller contractors, otherwise it will impact the entire ecosystem negatively,” he said. \n Agreeing, Mr Ernie Koh, who is the executive director of furniture manufacturer Koda and an adviser to the Singapore Furniture Industries Council, said companies whose “balance sheets are strong” and can pull through the current downturn should help support those who are struggling. \n “I have always believed in supporting local businesses… Everyone has to stay afloat and with the big boys helping the small ones, we can all stay afloat (through this period),” said Mr Koh, who was one of the representatives present at the closed-door meeting. \n BUSINESSES CONFIDENT OVER GOVERNMENT MEASURES  \n Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr Chan said he was also happy with the feedback from the business leaders that they are confident with the measures that have been taken by the Government to combat the outbreak. \n “Many of them said they are assured that Singapore has expanded its surveillance regime to help detect more cases compared to some other countries who may not have been as rigorous in their detection and surveillance processes,” he said. \n The business leaders also told Mr Chan that they were looking forward to “position themselves for the recovery” and rebound from the ongoing crisis. \n To do so, the companies have taken advantage of the current situation to strengthen the training of their workers, review their current business models and production processes, said Mr Chan. \n “I think this speaks very well for our business community that while they manage the current situation, they also have an eye for the future to make sure that we can be the fastest one to recover (from the crisis).“ \n Mr Alexander Melchers, vice-president of the Singapore National Employers Federation, said that after the Sars outbreak in 2003 was contained, the rebound for businesses was significant. \n That is why Mr Melchers, whose firm C Melchers Gmbh & Co is in the luxury goods business, has already started to make preparations for when the economy picks up again. \n “I’m telling my staff and the people that I work with to get ready for the upturn. There will be a rebound and we want to be ready for it. The staff needs to be there and they need to be skilled, ready and motivated,” he said. \n MEASURES TO SUPPORT WORKERS TO BE ANNOUNCED DURING BUDGET 2020 \n When asked on how the Government will support businesses who are struggling during this period, Mr Chan said additional measures to support businesses and workers during this downturn will be announced on Tuesday in Budget 2020. \n The Budget Speech will be delivered by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat in Parliament on Feb 18 at 3pm. \n Mr Chan added that the authorities have taken lessons from previous national crises such as the Sars outbreak, the global financial crisis and H1N1 when designing the measures. But since each crisis still has its own unique set of challenges, he cautioned that the measures will not necessarily be the same. \n “So while we can take a lesson from the past, we must also apply them in context,” he said. \n "}, {"content": "Novo coronavírus.

Certain mathematical models for simulating financial markets are similar to those for studying epidemics. \n We know this because we are two financial modellers who have been involved in modelling epidemics for public health authorities. \n Here, we would like to do our bit for public education on the Covid-19 outbreak by explaining five concepts from epidemiology, which is the study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why.  \n The hope is that when the public is better able to understand what information about Covid-19 is shared, it will minimise irrational fear. \n KEY STATISTICS \n The media has been reporting on the number of newly infected and deaths cases daily. What is equally important is the number of recoveries, which is infrequently reported by the media. \n Imagine this: There are 10 newly infected and three deaths one day. This sounds terrible, but if eight people recover on that day, then there is a net “exit” of one patient (3+8-10) from the pool. \n In any epidemic, perhaps the most important indicator is whether the net pool is increasing or decreasing. \n Another helpful statistic is the growth factor, which is each day's new cases divided by new cases from the previous day.   \n The growth factor computed from total cases reported (worldwide) was mostly below one from Feb 13 to 19, but surged back to mostly above one from Feb 20 until now, as infections began spreading rapidly beyond China to other countries. \n Sophisticated models should also consider relevant country-level statistics, such as population, density, travel frequencies, medical resources available per capita and spare capacities in health systems to cope with infectious diseases.  \n EPIDEMIC PYRAMID \n The typical classifications in an epidemic pyramid are death, severe, mild and asymptomatic, as follows:  \n  \n Learning from their Sars outbreak experience in 2003, Singapore and Taiwan have resources and operating procedures in place to reach deep down the pyramid to trace every (asymptomatic) case possible even before symptoms are shown.   \n But let’s be realistic. No matter how effective the screening process is, there will be misdiagnosis. \n Initial statistics collected from any outbreak almost always understate the full burden.  \n For example, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially estimated 12,469 deaths for the H1N1 virus in the US from April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010. But by 2019, it increased its estimate for that period to at least 75,000 deaths, or six times the earlier figure. \n Initial observed fatality statistics can be used to project the full burden with data that may take months or even years to arrive. This is called a cross-sectional problem because we take one cross section of the pyramid to make an educated guess on the size of a deeper cross section of the pyramid.  \n Case fatality rate is the number of deaths over a defined period of time divided by the number of individuals diagnosed with the disease during that time.  \n This is a different problem by focusing on the time dimension. As long as epidemic models are careful in drawing conclusions from data already available at specific time points, they can still provide helpful insights. \n TOCC (TRAVEL, OCCUPATION, CONTACT, CLUSTER) TRACING \n Some countries may be too big in physical size. Many lack the resources to test and diagnose every suspected case.  \n Moreover, many patients avoid seeking medical help until they show severe symptoms. As a result, we have to assume that a portion of undiagnosed patients may still be infecting others in the overall population.  \n As long as there is a way to perform TOCC tracing from the diagnosed cases, there is a path to slow down the spread of infections.  \n Public health officials worry the most about infections from unknown sources — also known as the silent patients — in which contacts cannot be back-traced easily.  \n When the silent patients include say a taxi driver, he or she may have infected some passengers with no easy way to trace all related passengers riding his/her taxi.  \n That is how epidemic control can become extremely challenging.  \n Those were the worrying signs observed in the early stages in Wuhan and Hubei, and perhaps we are noticing similar patterns emerging in Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy.   \n TREATMENTS \n From an epidemiological point of view, patients are removed from the pool by either recoveries or deaths.  \n The human body does have natural mechanisms to rid itself of viruses including the Covid-19 virus, but that is not always successful before the onset of other fatal complications.  \n Therefore, the medical goal is to increase recoveries by treatments and to decrease deaths. \n Certain treatments such as antibody therapy have been around since the 1970s. The issues are what dosage to use for which types of patients, and whether there are any potential side effects.  \n Safe vaccines may take many months to develop by clinical trials.  \n In a public health emergency such as the outbreak in Wuhan, public health authorities may choose to bypass lengthy clinical trial procedures, but it is unwise if shortcuts are taken everywhere.    \n EPIDEMIC MODELS \n Epidemiologists describe the dynamics of how a disease is spread with mathematical models to better predict the effectiveness of disease control measures using “before and after” analyses. \n Impactful epidemic models require: 1) reasonable and transparent data as model parameters, or the entire exercise will become “garbage in, garbage out”; 2) a research environment where model results can be discussed openly to focus time and energy on the roughly correct models.  \n There is a legitimate policy concern that raw data may be prone to misinterpretations by potentially faulty analyses, creating unnecessary fear among the public. \n Discussions among responsible scientists can take place in a “moderated” but still expedited forum (such as on the medRxiv server co-hosted by Yale) to encourage participation and to minimise unnecessary overreactions to preliminary results. \n This way, “scientifically credible” clinical data can be released in a much shorter timeframe than the typical journal peer review process to allow other scientists to begin accessing the data, creating a win-win solution to address both scientific and public policy concerns. \n We encourage everyone with a good grasp of these concepts to review the primary sources instead of relying solely on secondary sources to interpret the statistics.  \n For example, a recent report by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre and the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London shows the estimates of the overall case fatality ratio in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of Covid-19 to be approximately 1 per cent.  \n The confidence range is from 0.5 per cent to 4 per cent. At the low end of the range or 0.5 per cent, Covid-19 is a low fatality but highly infectious disease like a terrible influenza, but public health officials may need to consider additional measures at the high end of the range or 4 per cent.  \n Armed with better understanding of information shared, the public will be more prepared until effective vaccines and treatments become widely available.  \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Anthony G Constantinides is Professor of Communications and Signal Processing of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and heads the Financial Signal Processing Lab at Imperial College London. Imperial alumnus Dr Bernard Lee is Founder and CEO of financial analytics firm HedgeSPA and author of Investment Analytics in the Dawn of Artificial Intelligence. \n "}, {"content": "Crece la ira en China sobre cómo se gestó la epidemia de coronavirus. Le dieron la noticia este miércoles en el hospital número 4 de Wuhan. Su suegro había fallecido, uno de los más de 200 víctimas mortales del coronavirus que asuela esa ciudad. El individuo al que un informe policial publicado este viernes identifica como Ke no pudo contenerse. Se abalanzó sobre dos médicos y comenzó a golpearlos, arrancándoles la ropa protectora. Se encuentra ahora bajo custodia policial.\nEs un incidente más de los muchos que dejan en evidencia estos días la furia del público en torno a una crisis, la epidemia de coronavirus, de la que culpan a la desastrosa gestión de las autoridades locales de Wuhan y su provincia, Hubei. Una epidemia que ya ha infectado a cerca de 10.000 personas y en la que, pese al refuerzo de los suministros y al envío de miles de médicos y sanitarios adicionales, sigue faltando material protector suficiente en los hospitales y doctores y enfermeras se encuentran al borde del agotamiento.\nLa tensión entre el Gobierno central -dispuesto a acabar con la epidemia y el descontento de la oblación a toda costa-, y unas autoridades locales que quieren evitar que se les responsabilice del caos, es evidente estos días, en los que llueven las acusaciones del uno y el otro lado. Y el escalón más bajo lleva las de perder. Según la revista Southern Weekly, ya 33 funcionarios de nivel municipal o provincial han sido destituidos, amonestados o se les ha abierto un expediente por mala gestión de la crisis.\nAl malestar por el desbordamiento en los centros sanitarios se ha sumado la publicación de una serie de informaciones científicas que corroboran las sospechas de que se ocultó información clave al público durante las primeras semanas, mientras el problema se hacía cada vez mayor en diciembre y la mayor parte de enero.\nUn informe de un numeroso grupo de expertos oficiales chinos, que publicaba el miércoles el New England Journal of Medicine, encontraba, tras examinar los primeros 425 casos de infección en Wuhan, que los contagios entre seres humanos empezaron a darse desde mediados de diciembre. Pero las autoridades insistieron en que no había indicios de ello. Finalmente, se admitió el 20 de enero, cuando la propagación de la epidemia comenzó a dispararse.\n“Decir que estoy furioso es quedarme corto. No tengo palabras”, publicaba en Weibo, el Twitter chino, el catedrático de Biología en la Universidad de Zhejiang Wang Liming, tras leer el informe, “es la primera prueba sólida de que se ocultó intencionadamente que había contagios entre humanos”. Su mensaje desde entonces ha sido borrado.\nBuena parte de las iras se dirigen no contra el Gobierno central -el consenso entre la mayoría de la población es que las cosas han mejorado desde que ha tomado el control de la crisis-, sino contra las autoridades provinciales de Hubei y el alcalde de Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, una figura que parece tener los días contados en el cargo. El último en arremeter contra él ha sido el epidemiólogo jefe en el Centro de Prevención y Control de Enfermedades, Zeng Guang. En una entrevista con el periódico estatal Global Times, ha apuntado que el gobierno municipal de Wuhan pudo haber tardado en responder a la crisis “principalmente por la falta de conocimientos científicos” sobre el nuevo tipo de coronavirus, pero también por “cierta indecisión en la toma de medidas”.\nDurante esas primeras semanas vitales, según las críticas, Zhou no solo tardó en ofrecer información, sino que actuó de modo que, a todas luces, contribuyó a diseminar la infección. A principios de enero organizaba una comida con 40.000 personas para batir un récord de participación. E insistía en que la gente se fuera de vacaciones para el Año Nuevo lunar: antes del cierre por cuarentena el día 23, se habían marchado de la ciudad cinco millones de personas.\nTambién se le acusa de haber intentado suprimir información.

In support of each employee placed on leave during this period, it will allow eligible employers and self-employed persons to claim S$100 a day.  \n This comes a day after the Government announced that students and staff members from schools, preschools and student care centres who returned from overseas between March 14 and 20 will be placed on a mandatory 14-day leave of absence from their date of return. \n In a statement on Friday (March 20), MOM encouraged employers to impose a similar 14-day leave of absence for all employees returning to Singapore between those dates. \n \"The Government recognises that many parents have been affected by this national measure due to the need to provide care for their children during this period,\" MOM said, adding that it is a “useful precautionary measure” for recent travellers to stay away from the workplace to prevent further transmission of Covid-19. \n School holidays this year for the month starts from March 14 to 22.  \n The ministry called on employers to first adopt flexible arrangements to allow affected employees to work from home during their company-imposed leave-of-absence period. \n But if working from home is not feasible, they are encouraged to provide more paid leave, and eligible employers will be able to claim the S$100 in daily support for each affected staff member who completes the leave of absence, MOM said. \n Self-employed persons will also be eligible to apply if they have self-imposed the 14-day leave of absence. \n However, employers and self-employed persons will not be eligible if they or the affected employee performed work remotely or if they were required to use their own annual leave, childcare leave or other paid leave during the leave-of-absence period, MOM said. \n   \n Those with affected employees placed on a mandatory stay-home notice but whose travel did not start before the following specified dates will also not be eligible:                      \n Travelling to mainland China on or before Jan 31, 2020;        \n Travelling to Daegu city or Cheongdo county in South Korea on or before Feb 26, 2020; \n Travelling to South Korea, Northern Italy, or Iran on or before March 4, 2020; \n Travelling to Italy, Spain, France or Germany on or before March 15, 2020; \n Traveling to Asean countries, Japan, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom on or before March 16, 2020; or                    \n Travelling to all other countries on or before March 20, 2020. \n People given stay-home orders must remain in their place of residence at all times, while people on leave of absence are allowed to leave their place of residence to buy daily necessities or to attend to important personal matters.  \n Only Singapore citizens, permanent residents and work pass holders are covered under the leave-of-absence support programme, while employers with affected work pass holders will also qualify for a levy waiver. \n Singapore tightened its travel restrictions on Wednesday to stem the rise of imported Covid-19 cases here. \n All travellers arriving in Singapore after 11:59pm on Friday will be issued with stay-home notices under the expanded restrictions. \n "}, {"content": "Coronavirus vaccine may still be a year away: Australian University.

MONTREAL - The U.N.'s aviation agency on Friday approved restrictions for a global program designed to help airlines offset their carbon emissions, a move that curbs industry funding for older projects whose environmental benefits have been challenged by climate activists.  \n The International Civil Aviation Organization council approved recommendations to exclude offset projects begun before 2016 while delivering emission reductions through end-2020, ICAO said in a statement, confirming a report earlier in the day by Reuters.  \n ICAO cannot impose rules but sets standards approved by its 193 member countries. Its 36-member council was tasked with weighing which programs would be eligible under the venture for airlines, known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).  \n The council's decision to accept credits from six programs for CORSIA's pilot phase from 2021-2023 came despite protests from Brazil, China and India, which wanted older projects to be eligible, said two sources who discussed the private talks on condition of anonymity.  \n Developing countries had hoped a global push by airlines to offset emissions would mop up a glut of carbon credits awarded under earlier climate initiatives.  \n One of the six programs is the United Nations' Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the world's largest offset scheme set up under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to help fund emissions reductions in developing countries.  \n The fate of billions of older CDM credits, the majority of which come from China and India, was a thorny and unresolved issue for climate negotiators in Madrid in December, raising the stakes for ICAO.  \n ICAO was under pressure to strike a balance between approving enough credit options for airlines to purchase under the plan without squashing supply, which could push up prices.  \n Some environmentalists feared the council would approve weaker standards to help airlines hard-hit by the global outbreak of a coronavirus called COVID-19 that has led carriers to seek urgent government financial support.

SINGAPORE — Earlier this month, Dr Chng Woei was asked by her 24-year-old daughter if the family was not going to have dinner with the maternal grandparents until “this dies down”.   \n “This” refers to the Covid-19 crisis which has hit every continent except Antarctica, and has earlier this week been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.  \n And dinner with the elderly folks was out of the question till the situation improves, the general practitioner (GP) replied to her daughter.  \n The 51-year-old, who works at Healthmark Medical Clinic in Punggol, would rather be safe than sorry. Since the clinic is a Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC), a network of clinics providing subsidised treatment and medication during public health outbreaks, she could never be certain if the next patient she sees is a Covid-19 carrier, and her worst fear is that she may end up transmitting the virus to her parents who are in their 80s.  \n That is why she has restricted her family’s visits to her parents’ house to less than 30 minutes each time. Even then, they would not have dinner together, unlike before.  \n “I can’t afford for them to catch the disease,” said Dr Chng, aware that the novel coronavirus can prove deadly for old people with weaker immune systems. \n Outside her consultation room is a staff nurse who is seven months pregnant. \n Despite being heavy with child, 38-year-old Norashinta Mansoor continues to soldier on with her duties — to screen, identify and separate the higher-risk walk-in patients at the neighbourhood clinic, so that the GPs can be properly dressed in full personal protective equipment (PPE) when seeing the suspect cases. \n Asked why she had chosen to work on the frontline, even though she was given the option not to because of her pregnancy, Ms Norashinta said she had instinctively gone into a crisis mode after the virus landed on Singapore’s shores on Jan 23. She remains unfazed at having to handle her third infectious disease outbreak as a nurse — the first two were Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003 and H1N1 in 2009.  \n In fact, she is feeling guilty that she will have to go on her four-month maternity leave from next month, and is encouraging her colleagues to take the necessary time off to rest before she goes away. \n  Despite being six to seven months pregnant, Ms Norashinta Mansoor, a clinical assistant and trained nurse with Healthmark Medical Clinic in Punggol, pressed on to work at the frontline from the start of the Covid-19 outbreak.

She had just returned from her maternity leave in the first week of February when she was tasked with managing both suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases.  \n With the frontline staff’s ongoing travel restrictions, the 31-year-old’s original plans to breastfeed her first-born — now four months old — regularly had to be shelved as she could no longer make trips to send the pumped milk back to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, where her baby is, as and when she wanted to. \n She had since obtained special permission from her bosses once a month to travel, see her baby, and send two weeks’ supply of breast milk. But to make up for the rest of the month, her husband would have to make at least one trip to Singapore to get more milk from her. \n “I really miss my child, but for his safety also, I don’t want to always go back as I am currently nursing confirmed Covid-19 cases,” said Ms Tay. \n Meanwhile, Dr Leong Choon Kit, 53, who runs Mission Medical Clinic in Serangoon, is keeping a distance of at least one metre from his loved ones, including his wife and teenage daughter. \n That means sleeping on a foldable mattress at night, while his wife takes the spot on the bed. And there are no hugs and kisses too, he added. \n Sacrifices such as these have become part and parcel of life for those working on the frontline in the fight against the highly contagious Covid-19 virus in Singapore, which has seen a total of 200 confirmed cases as of Friday (March 13). \n For more than a month now, frontline healthcare workers have been grappling with lost time with family members and disruptions to their personal routines and plans.  \n Many have to endure working long hours under a plasticky nursing gown, goggles that could fog up, an N95 mask so snugly-fitted that it could cause a headache over prolonged use, a shower cap and gloves.  \n They also have to deal with the mental strain of having to keep up with constantly changing standard operating protocols and definitions of suspect cases as the Covid-19 situation rapidly evolves. \n Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a senior doctor juggling duties between TTSH’s Emergency Department and the NCID, told TODAY that they are at “version 43” of their clinical protocol as of Thursday — just 50 days after the first Covid-19 case was announced here.  \n In recognition of their invaluable role, along with the sacrifices that come with it, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced in Parliament on Feb 28 that public officers directly battling the disease will get a special bonus of up to one month, while a one-off Covid-19 grant will be given to 900 PHPCs, including more than 600 GP clinics, which had been activated to deal with the public health crisis.  \n As Singaporeans adjust to living with Covid-19, TODAY spoke to some 20 frontline workers to get a glimpse of how their lives had been upended by the pandemic.  \n  Ms Bernalyn Jane Tay, a senior staff nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, makes a video call with her husband Jason Raj and son Ashton Raj, just after reaching home from a midnight shift at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.

Why are we talking about dying?” Dr Leong remembered saying in reply. \n Dr Philip Koh, 54, a GP with a Healthway Medical branch in Tampines, said a young doctor had also shared with him that for the first time, he had told his father “I love you”, just in case he dies from Covid-19. \n While such anxiety has since subsided as more scientific information on the virus emerges, some GPs today, especially those with young kids and elderly parents, remain adamant about not taking chances and risking the lives of their loved ones. \n Among them is Dr Lee, a GP who goes beyond the MOH requirements to wear the full PPE for every single patient he sees.  \n Inevitably, his outfit had attracted the attention of some of his patients, said the doctor who declined to give his full name.  \n But the 35-year-old, who practises in an Aljunied clinic and works part-time as a locum, would explain to them that it is his way of protecting his two-year-old daughter who is also looked after by his parents who are entering their 70s.  \n “When I go to work, the first thing I care about is my daughter and my family. Although I care about my patients, my family comes first… I don’t want to infect them. If an elderly gets it, it becomes bad and can turn into an ICU (Intensive Care Unit) case,” said Dr Lee, whose wife is also a GP.  \n Noting that some of his GP friends are voluntarily wearing full PPE as well, he added: “If you are a family man, you just have to take care of yourself and your own family first.” \n  Dr Lee, a general practitioner, will not take a chance on dressing down when he sees patients walking through the clinic daily, even if they declare that they do not have fever or flu symptoms. Photo courtesy of Dr Lee \n DEALING WITH PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT UPFRONT  \n The full PPE is all the more necessary for him, as he had observed a trend of patients making false declarations that they had no respiratory symptoms at the front counter of the clinic, only to “ambush” him by coming clean to him about their runny nose, sore throat or cough in the consultation room. \n Typically, a clinic following PHPC guidelines would have triage staff segregating patients who better fit Covid-19 suspect case definition from other patients to minimise any cross-transmission. The process also ensures that the GP could be forewarned to don the PPE before seeing higher-risk patients.  \n Dr Lee got so irritated with such irresponsible behaviour that he decided to take a tally during a shift on March 5, and found that five out of the 20 patients he saw within a two-hour period were not upfront about their medical condition.  \n “It beats me why they don’t declare… They lie even when the triage staff warned them twice about the consequences of what might happen to them if they don’t declare,” said Dr Lee. \n “I put my life on the line to help, so I am asking the public to be more socially responsible.” \n MOH this week urged members of the public to be socially responsible as well, noting that despite its advisories against doctor-hopping, 38 of 160 Covid-19 cases had visited more than one GP clinic, and eight among them visited more than three GP clinics.  \n Family doctor Jody Liu, father of three children aged four, seven, and nine, is also afraid of bringing the virus home and puts on an “almost full PPE”— goggles, an N95 mask and gloves — at work. \n But while the 38-year-old does not wear a disposable nursing gown, he has been making sure that he changes out of his work outfit before going home. And the first thing he would do back home is to head to the shower before his kids could touch him.  \n For the time being, he has also stopped wearing a watch and stopped using his phone during his two shifts — from 8.30am to 2pm and 6pm to 9pm — to reduce surface contamination. He also comes to work about 15 minutes earlier to prepare for the day and leave about 15 minutes later to clean himself and his workstation, all of which adds up to an extra one hour for his double-shift work days that he could have spent with his kids. \n These are important measures as Dr Liu, who works at a PHPC, recognises that GPs like him may be called upon to assess people under the stay-home notice or home quarantine should they develop symptoms of the virus, such as fever, cough or breathlessness.  \n “We are like the ministry’s or the NCID’s triage,” he said. “If we suspect them, then they get to the hospital.” \n MANPOWER SHORTAGES, FAMILY MEMBERS CHIPPING IN  \n Dr Clarence Yeo, from Killiney Medical Clinic in the River Valley area, had been working almost daily since February. He believes this would be “useful for the patients”, since MOH had advised that a patient should be reviewed by the same GP if they continued to develop symptoms after consulting one. \n The 47-year-old GP who sees an average of 50 to 60 patients daily — about half of them coming in with fever, flu or cough — said he will wait for the number of Covid-19 cases here to dwindle before considering taking leave. \n Asked when that might be, he said: “It is very hard to predict. We can’t say the next month, May, or June.”  \n Regardless, he is ready to put in the hours for as long as the outbreak drags on. \n In his second televised address to the nation on the Covid-19 situation on March 12, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the outbreak “will continue for some time — a year, and maybe longer”. \n Dr Alvina Nam, 52, who runs Clinic@Costa located in Bayshore’s Costa Del Sol condominium, could not find a triage staff at short notice, so she enlisted the help of her 77-year-old mother and 49-year-old sister who were also eager to lend a hand. \n The two women now take turns manning a booth outside the clinic, which is on the PHPC network, to record the temperature of patients at the clinic and ask pertinent questions, such as whether they have any recent travel history over the last three weeks or if they possibly have had any contact with a confirmed Covid-19 case. \n  Dr Alvina Nam (right), a general practitioner, with her sister Ms Serena Nam (left) and mother Mrs Susan Nam, who help screen patients before they enter the clinic. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n “Am I subjecting them to possible virus infection? There is always a possibility… (but) they accept the risk,” said Dr Nam. \n She added: “My mother is also old and not in the best of health. There is a small risk and certain fear, but they are generally understanding and want to pitch in during this time.” \n Her sister, Ms Serena Nam, a teacher who left the workforce after giving birth to her son eight years ago, told TODAY: “She is my sister. It never occurred to me (to refuse to help). We are a very close-knit family.”   \n After all, she had dealt with bigger fears than contracting Covid-19.  \n Ms Nam had been a resident in Hong Kong for 20 years but she recently returned to Singapore so that her son could continue schooling as protests roiled the Chinese city. “After all that turmoil, you’ll kind of say, okay, I will survive,” she said. \n GPs are not the only ones who are struggling with staffing woes. Manpower shortages and extra shifts are also common at restructured hospitals.  \n LIFE IN THE NCID  \n TTSH’s Dr Ng and assistant nurse clinician Ong Zh Hua gave TODAY a glimpse of what life is like in the NCID, which sees three in four of the nation’s Covid-19 cases. \n They were originally part of TTSH’s Emergency Department team which had screened the hospital’s initial suspected cases since December, well before the NCID’s screening centre was up and running by Jan 29. They now alternate shifts between the two departments.  \n Dr Ng’s most memorable shift took place on Feb 5, the day after MOH announced Singapore’s first four cases of local transmission detected at Yong Thai Hang, a Chinese health products shop at Cavan Road in Lavender. \n It happened to be his very first shift at NCID and an unexpected crowd of 300 worried individuals flocked to the screening centre to get checked for Covid-19, after MOH said it would be getting in touch with people who had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to mainland China. \n Dr Ng was the only senior doctor rostered with five junior doctors then.  \n “That was a very, very bad shift, but we survived because people came from all over to help,” said the 33-year-old.  \n  Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a doctor at Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Emergency Department. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n Before he knew it, manpower was diverted from the team manning the Emergency Department. Two consultants, two registrars and a few more doctors arrived to help at short notice. \n And not once did he sense anyone having the attitude of “it is not my problem. I am not manning this post”. “They asked if I needed help even before I asked for help,” said Dr Ng. \n Still, he remembered having only “barely survived” that shift. \n On other days, Dr Ng said he faced challenges such as being verbally abused by an unstable suspected Covid-19 patient who screamed at him and threatened to escape from the isolation area, prompting him to call for security back-up.  \n To deal with the hospital’s increased caseload, Dr Ng also had to work extra shifts, sacrificing time with his five-year-old son and wife, who is currently four months pregnant. His wife is a doctor at the National University Hospital. \n Ms Ong, 36, meanwhile, had to forgo two weeks’ leave to train nurses who were seconded to work at the screening centre.  \n She was supposed to spend Chinese New Year with her family in Sarawak, Malaysia, but ended up having to work on both the eve and the first day of the festival. \n Now that travel restrictions have been imposed on frontline workers, Ms Ng said she may have to cancel her plans to return to her hometown later this month for Qing Ming, the Chinese tomb-sweeping festival. \n A 23-year-old outbreak nurse at a hospital, who declined to be named, said that her busiest day entailed her and three other nurses having to settle 20 suspected Covid-19 case admissions during her 12-hour night shift, as a result of contact tracing efforts. \n Thankfully, two nurses were redeployed from other wards so they could finish their shift in time. \n She also noted having to deal with the psychological states of her patients, on top of managing their clinical needs. In one instance, she had to manage a suspected Covid-19 female patient who was listed as a high-suicide risk while being confined. \n “Some of them were actually quite confident that they didn’t have it and still wanted to go home as soon as the swab test was out,” she said. “Some who were tested positive might still be in a state of denial.” \n  Ms Ong Zh Hua, an assistant nurse clinician at Tan Tock Seng Hospital who works in both the screening centre and emergency department, dons a full set of personal protective equipment. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n BEYOND N95-INFLICTED ‘BATTLE SCARS’  \n Now imagine having to deal with all these work contingencies while running around covered by a humid, overheated “shell”— the full PPE — amid muggy weather this past fortnight.  \n As Senior Staff Nurse Benjamin Ong, 29, from TTSH’s Department of Emergency Medicine, had put it candidly in an Instagram post that went viral: “Life as a frontline during this period isn’t easy, to be honest it sucks. \n “You kiss your loved ones goodbye before heading to the ‘war zone’... Trust me, it isn’t easy to breathe wearing any of those (N95 or powered air-purifying respirator), and with all that protection on, you work quick and fast, catching your breath with every step you make because life matters.” \n He added: “After finishing your shift sweaty with tiredness, aching back, sore calf, painful ankles, you found out that not only is your annual leave frozen, you are not even allowed to leave the country as a frontline staff.” \n Indeed, the hospital frontline workers told TODAY it is common now to end their work day drenched in their own perspiration and dehydrated, as they were reluctant to drink more water, just in case they might need to “degown” often for toilet breaks.  \n Besides getting “battle scars”— facial imprints, pressure sores, abrasions and even blisters on their nose bridge left behind by prolonged N95 use — some frontline workers are also getting pimple outbreaks. \n For TTSH nurse Ms Ong, wearing the N95 for more than four hours had led to pain at the point where the mask’s strap cuts into the skin above the ear.  \n Difficulty from breathing under it has also given her dizzy spells sometimes, while some of her colleagues had felt nauseous or even vomited as a result, Ms Ong said. \n Her sweat-drenched shirt from all the running around had also caused her to feel cold mid-shift, and she had adapted by making it a routine to change into another shirt during one of her breaks. \n During their mealtimes, they also have to observe social-distancing by sitting about two metres apart from one another.  \n And they would have to be reminded to eat, with nurses taking turns to make sure that team-mates do not get so overwhelmed that they skip lunch.  \n For Dr Ng, the constant use of alcohol-based hand rubs recently had caused eczema to flare up on his hands as they became dry and chapped. He had been aggressively applying steroid medication to reduce the inflammation and itch. \n  Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a doctor at Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Emergency Department, has blisters on his hands from daily use of disinfecting alcohol rub that dries out the skin. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n The full PPE had also made it difficult for co-workers at the screening centre to recognise who’s who, he said. “Nurses didn’t know where the doctors were.” \n To get round the problem, the frontline workers had implemented coloured caps for easy identification. Senior doctors wear green caps, junior doctors blue caps, nurses white caps, while support staff wear red caps.  \n At their “gowning stations”, there are also rows of duct tape so that workers could write their name prominently and stick it onto their gowns, Dr Ng said. \n Doctors and nurses also “gown and de-gown our phones as well”, Dr Ng said, referring to the practice of placing their clean phones in clear ziplock bags and disposing of the exposed bags in the biohazardous waste bin, where they also dump their PPE. \n The process ensures that their mobile phone surfaces stay virus-free. \n Emergency nurses at private hospitals, such as Senior Staff Nurse Nicholas Zhu of Farrer Park Hospital, also have to don the full PPE over long hours as and when suspected Covid-19 cases are being held at an isolation area. \n The 34-year-old said his perspiration had caused his goggles to fog up slightly, but he would have to leave it on throughout his entire 12-hour shift on busier days.  \n MORALE BOOSTERS \n With all the myriad of challenges, work days now seem to be longer for frontline healthcare workers.  \n But Ms Capre Rena Joy Sobremisana, a senior staff nurse at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, noted how everyone has been pressing on. \n “When duty calls, we drop everything, such as spending time with our family and friends. We tend to power through a busy shift even if our bodies tell us to sit down and have a rest,” the 34-year-old told TODAY. \n  Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a senior doctor at Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s emergency department, received this photo from his son’s preschool teacher during one of his shifts. Photo courtesy of Ng Wei Xiang \n The long shifts get more bearable these days, thanks to morale boosters coming in the form of food, presents and “thank you” notes from members of the public — a marked change from before when some healthcare workers donning their uniforms found themselves being ostracised in public. \n The nurses and doctors said they are thankful for the chicken rice, nasi lemak, cookies, bubble tea, skin care products and flowers, among other things, that come their way.  \n But the gifts that take away all their fatigue are usually the extra special ones from their families. \n For TTSH’s Dr Ng, that pick-me-up came via a WhatsApp message during a hectic work day, sent to him from his son’s preschool teacher. It was a photo of his five-year-old holding up a drawing paper on which he wrote: “I love you. Thank you for saving Singapore.” \n "}, {"content": "População proibida de sair de Wuhan devido a vírus.

Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak which lasted four months in Singapore in 2003, the current Covid-19 outbreak in Singapore is likely to continue for at least a year. \n He outlined some baseline things Singapore must get used to — such as practising good personal hygiene and social distancing — and how the country must plan for a possible spike in cases. \n Here, I would like to elaborate on some key features of the Covid-19 pandemic that may be less well-known and what they mean for how Singapore tackles the outbreak. \n First, we know that an infected person will typically transmit the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19) to two to three close contacts, predominantly via droplet spread. \n What is less commonly known is the serial interval, defined as the duration between the onset of symptoms of an infected person and the symptom onset of the people he or she transmits the virus to. \n This is between four and six days for the coronavirus, longer than the serial interval of influenza (two to three days). \n Thus the spread of Sars-CoV-2 has been slower and less explosive than a pandemic influenza virus, which last emerged in 2009. \n This slightly longer serial interval provides more time for contact tracing and interventions such as the quarantining of close contacts to break the chain of transmission. \n However, Covid-19 is characteristically mild during the first few days, and is virtually indistinguishable from an ordinary upper respiratory tract infection — upwards of 20 per cent of patients may not have fever at the start, but are nonetheless infectious. \n Of greater importance is that approximately 5 per cent of confirmed adult cases will require mechanical ventilatory support in an intensive care setting. \n The mortality rate was strikingly high in China’s Wuhan and Italy’s Lombardy because hospitals were overwhelmed and intensive care facilities were not available to many who required them. \n Secondly, there is no proven effective treatment for Covid-19 as yet, although more than 100 clinical trials are being launched. \n Several Sars-CoV-2 vaccine candidates have been developed. However, having a commercially available vaccine available in just over a year from now remains an optimistic estimate, even with expedited regulatory approval in view of the multiple safety and efficacy trials necessary. \n Thirdly, the contours of the epidemic have changed substantially since the start of the year. China is no longer the epicentre of the outbreak after weeks of extraordinary efforts including the lockdown of Wuhan and several cities in Hubei. \n Iran and Italy, however, became secondary epicentres for the spread of the virus to the Middle East and Europe respectively, while struggling to cope with their own outsized local outbreaks. \n Cases have now increased dramatically worldwide, particularly in Europe and also the United States. \n In several low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia, the number of tests done and cases reported to date remain worryingly low. There is considerable uncertainty about the scale of the outbreak in these countries. \n This current state of affairs, where most territories are either at the ascending phase of their local outbreaks or where outbreak containment is beyond their means, is why Sars-CoV-2 will likely continue to spread around the world for the foreseeable future. \n It could even become an endemic virus like seasonal influenza or chickenpox. \n An effective vaccine will considerably ameliorate its impact in a way that is similar to measles and chickenpox, but it will not remove the threat entirely. \n In Singapore, current efforts have significantly contained the spread such that the healthcare system has not been overwhelmed despite occasional spikes of suspect and confirmed cases from different clusters. \n Nonetheless, the recent surge of cases worldwide contributed to an increase in imported cases over the past few days. Some citizens from neighbouring countries also came to Singapore with the express intent of seeking medical care. \n These developments led to the implementation of the most far-reaching travel restrictions in Singapore to date. \n But unless Singapore completely shuts its borders to the world for the duration of the pandemic, a drastic intervention that would hugely impact the economy and all aspects of life here and which our political leaders have repeatedly stressed we cannot afford to do, there will be continued importation of cases. \n These have the potential to generate clusters of secondary cases, adding to the ongoing community spread already present within the country. \n This is not a cause for despair however, because we have been successful so far. But it does mean that long-term sustainability of control efforts becomes critical. \n From the perspective of the healthcare system, the key is to prevent any of its various components — primary care, acute and community hospitals, preventive services and so on — from being overwhelmed. \n This overwhelming of the system would not only result in eventual higher mortality from Covid-19, but would also have negative knock-on effects on the care of virtually all other medical conditions including, for example, heart disease, diabetes mellitus and cancer. \n Singapore’s current approach has been to minimise the risk for Sars-CoV-2 to spread in healthcare settings while creating capacity within the system. \n This includes: Heightened alert and screening at hospital and clinic entry points, delayed elective surgeries and outpatient follow-ups, as well as severely limited clinical — especially bedside — training for undergraduate and postgraduate healthcare personnel. \n But this is an immediate adaptive response to the outbreak that is unsustainable in the medium term. \n This will need to be evaluated with consistent policies at the national level to alleviate stress in healthcare staff. There is also a need to monitor the training of medical and nursing students to ensure that the current disruption of training does not affect their clinical competency when they graduate over the next couple of years. \n Different measures to offload pressure on the healthcare system and build surge capacity are no doubt being considered. \n PM Lee for instance has noted that if Singapore sees very large number of cases, we will not be able to hospitalise and islolate every case like we do now. \n The sensible thing to do then is to hospitalise only the more serious cases and isolate the majority with mild symptoms in the community setting, including at home. \n The Government has already incrementally recommended targeted social distancing practices, including the recent suspension of social activities for senior citizens aimed at protecting this particular vulnerable group. \n Other measures could include expanding Covid-19 testing in primary care (or even at home), much like what South Korea has done, and expanding the role of telemedicine in general. \n Cross-training a segment of the Singapore Armed Forces Volunteer Corps and perhaps even full-time national servicemen to be able to use personal protective equipment and function as medical orderlies could be a radical but potential way of expanding the healthcare worker pool in preparation for a possible large surge of cases in the future. \n They should ideally not be taking care of Covid-19 cases, but could help out in the care of patients with other diseases. Private hospitals can be co-opted for use for public sector non-Covid-19 patients as well. \n In conclusion, it is unlikely that the threat from Sars-CoV-2 will end in 2020, and may not entirely be dispelled even if an effective vaccine became available next year. \n Singapore has been successful in containing the epidemic to date, but will need to adapt further and implement innovative interventions in the healthcare system to ensure the sustainability of these efforts. \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang heads the Infectious Diseases Programme and is co-director of the Leadership Institute for Global Health Transformation at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore. \n "}, {"content": "Stella Calloni: El coronavirus puso al mundo entre las dignidades solidarias y la miserabilidad de un sistema que agoniza.

Cuando la atmósfera está saturada de materias inflamables, en cualquier momento, una chispa puede provocar una explosión financiera. Es difícil prever dónde puede producirse la chispa. La chispa es como si fuera un detonador pero no es la causa profunda de la crisis. Todavía no sabemos si la fuerte caída bursátil de fines de febrero de 2020 ‘degenerará’ en una enorme crisis financiera. Pero es una posibilidad real», sostiene Toussaint.\nAdvierte asimismo que «es importante ver de dónde proviene realmente la crisis y no dejarse engañar por las explicaciones que constituyen una cortina de humo ante las causas reales».\nEn tanto, lo que se está viendo en Europa es nada más y nada menos que el desenmascaramiento de la destrucción del sistema de bienestar que, con sus bajas y sus altas, se había logrado instalar en esos países.

Desde un principio, Estados Unidos fue claro con sus asociados en la Organización del Atlántico Norte (OTAN): «Nosotros tenemos el armamento necesario, pero ustedes deben pagarlo».\nCuánto sacrificó Europa para hacerse cargo de una guerra con invasiones y ocupación de países con los que podía negociar y obtener productos como el petróleo pagados en euros, conveniente para unos y otros y en paz.\nLas guerras de ocupación colonial contra Afganistán, Irak, Libia, Siria, Yemen (ambas aún en curso), y otras en preparación, no solo han destruido países con la pérdida de millones de vidas, desastres humanitarios, destruyendo además sitios, ciudades que eran patrimonios de la humanidad, cunas de la civilización, violando todos los derechos de las naciones victimizadas y las leyes internacionales, amparados por una escandalosa impunidad.\nEstas guerras coloniales unilaterales han significado una tragedia para los pueblos de Europa, víctimas además de las imposiciones neoliberales. Para pagar las armas y equipos sofisticados de última tecnología es posible que hayan utilizado, los gobiernos europeos, los casi 290.000 millones de euros que robaron al Estado libio como chacales, ya que estaban colocados a recaudo en bancos europeos ante el bloqueo de Estados Unidos.\nLos mayores «beneficiados» en estas guerras coloniales de alta criminalidad son los fabricantes de armas y equipos en Estados Unidos e Israel.\nIncluso economistas norteamericanos habían advertido que estas guerras, cuyas estrategias fueron trazadas en grandes mapas en los salones del Pentágono, estaban también destinadas a acabar con el bloque capitalista competitivo que podía ser la Unión Europea. Además de significar también una «guerra contra el euro», defendido a capa y espada por la alemana Ángela Merkel, la gobernante capitalista más política de Europa.\nAl final del desastre humanitario que significaron las invasiones y ocupaciones, estas guerras dejaron a las puertas de Europa millones de inmigrantes, desesperados, hambrientos sin hogar, sin país, sin patria. Solo basta con mirar las cifras de organismos internacionales antes de estas invasiones brutales para entender que en Libia o Siria la población tenía un nivel de vida a veces más alto que la de un ciudadano europeo común.\nHuyendo de la guerra, desamparados por los organismos internacionales, miles de desesperados fueron tragados por el mar o destinados a vivir como mendigos maltratados en las fronteras del horror. ¿Qué ganó Europa en todo esto? ¿Quién lidera la ocupación de esos países? ¿Quién se apropió del petróleo y otras riquezas territoriales?EL VIRUS QUE PARALIZÓ AL MUNDODesde principios de marzo, la Cancillería china sostiene que el Ejército de Estados Unidos podría haber llevado el coronavirus a la ciudad de Wuhan, la más afectada por el brote, donde en octubre de 2019 esos soldados realizaron maniobras militares.\n«¿Cuándo comenzó el paciente cero en Estados Unidos? ¿Cuántas personas están infectadas? ¿Cómo se llaman los hospitales? Podría ser el Ejército de EE.UU. lo que llevó la epidemia a Wuhan», dice un mensaje escrito en Twitter el pasado 9 de marzo por el portavoz de la Cancillería china, Zhao Lijian.\nPor su parte, Philip Giraldi, ex agente de la Agencia Central de Inteligencia (CIA), entrevistado por Hispan TV afirmó que su país podía haber creado este virus como un arma de guerra para dañar a China e Irán. En el caso de Italia, varios analistas remarcaron que este es el primer país europeo en firmar tantos acuerdos importantes con China, lo que enojó a Washington.\nPor su parte, militares iraníes también denunciaron que varios estudios demuestran que es posible que el COVID-19 sea una nueva estrategia y forma de guerra de Estados Unidos y aliados contra sus enemigos para «generar muertes, desestabilización e inestabilidad».\nEl analista internacional José Jofré Leal advirtió que no se trata de «nuevas estrategias y nuevas formas de guerra», ya que, de acuerdo con las investigaciones y estudios, en esta pandemia se combinan «elementos de guerra convencional, guerra irregular, guerra biológica y guerra cibernética».\nTambién se refirió a las declaraciones del líder de la revolución islámica de Irán, el ayatolá Seyed Ali Jamenei, quien ordenó movilizarse para enfrentar una guerra biológica ante la hipótesis de que el brote del COVID-19 sea un ataque de este tipo, argumentando que Estados Unidos estaría utilizando el nuevo coronavirus como un arma biológica. «Sobre todo, los propios chinos han admitido la posibilidad de que tropas estadounidenses hayan incorporado el coronavirus a China», dijo este experto en referencia a las maniobras que realizaron en Wuhan.\nRobert Redfield, director de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) de Estados Unidos, admitió el pasado 11 de marzo públicamente que algunos estadounidenses, que aparentemente murieron de influenza, dieron positivo en la prueba del nuevo coronavirus en el diagnóstico final.\nDe la misma manera, la portavoz del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Rusia, María Zarajova, consideró como «deliberadamente falsas» las acusaciones de Estados Unidos a Rusia por el coronavirus, recordando que el secretario de Comercio de ese país, Wilbur Ross, dijo en febrero pasado al diario chino Global Times que veía al virus como «una oportunidad», ya que podría ayudar a la recuperación de empleos en Estados Unidos en medio de la guerra comercial que Washington mantiene con Pekín.\nEn este mismo entorno, la OMS hizo una advertencia de que se acortan los tiempos para erradicar el coronavirus, que se convirtió en una pandemia -no tanto por las cifras de mortalidad, menores que las gripes y neumonías estacionales-, sino por la cantidad de países afectados, manifestando especialmente su preocupación por los casos que se dieron en Italia que no tienen un «vínculo epidemiológico claro» con lo sucedido en China.\nEn este marco de situaciones múltiples, los medios del sistema ocultan verdades, y frente a una tragedia humanitaria no dudan en manipular las informaciones y utilizarlas también como armas de una guerra ciega.\nEntre tantas sombras, desde una pequeña isla en el caribe, como es Cuba, a pesar de encontrarse bloqueada por la mayor potencia del mundo (Estados Unidos), han partido los medicamentos que han hecho posible el control de esta enfermedad en China, asociada con el gobierno cubano para producir medicinas en un gran laboratorio chino.\nMientras los gobiernos de ultraderecha y golpistas en América Latina han despojado a sus poblaciones de la única medicina que han recibido a lo largo de sus vidas de manos de los sacrificados médicos cubanos, como ha sucedido en Brasil, Bolivia y otros lugares, condenando a los pueblos al abandono en salud, Italia solicitó al gobierno cubano su ayuda médica.\nEstas son las luces y sombras de un momento de suma fragilidad que vive el mundo y en el cual es evidente que la solidaridad es el mayor antídoto, pero también la certeza de que no podemos dejar que se continúe jugando a la guerra, que sabemos que significa el final para la humanidad.(Fuente: Diario Contexto)\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus crash wipes $5 trillion off world stocks.

O grande timoneiro nadou a 16 de julho de 1966 nas águas do rio que banha Wuham, acompanhado por guarda-costas, para mostrar que aos 73 anos estava em plena forma física. É considerado o maior ato de propaganda política da República Popular da China. \r\nAs imagens do pai fundador do país, líder histórico do Partido Comunista Chinês, fundador do maoismo, correram Mundo. Mao Tsé-Tung tinha a sua residência de verão em Wuham, a capital da província de Hunan onde nasceu, no povoado pobre de Shaoshan, a quatrocentos quilómetros, onde ainda hoje se idolatra o líder. \n\r\nA ocasião é celebrada todos os anos, milhares de adoradores de Mao entram no Yangtsé, mas a cidade que banha já não é a mesma, tornou-se na meca do capitalismo à chinesa, rasgada por arranha-céus, povoada por lojas de cadeias ocidentais de vestuário, de ‘fast-food’, frequentadas pelos milhares de alunos de uma das maiores universidades chinesas e berço de unidades de produção das grandes marcas da indústria automóvel, o que já lhe valeu a comparação com Detroit, antes do declínio da cidade americana. \r\nAli vivem milhares de migrantes que trabalham nas grandes unidades da General Motors, Honda, Nissan, PSA e Renault, bem como nas chinesas Dongfeng (parceira e acionista da PSA) e SAIC (parceira da GM) que dá emprego a seis mil pessoas.\r\nMas foi na tradicional balbúrdia insalubre do mercado - que esteve para ser encerrado no ano passado e que vende peixe, mariscos e aves, mas também animais exóticos para consumo humano, de ouriços a crocodilos vivos - que foram identificados entre vendedores e frequentadores do espaço sintomas de pneumonia, depois reportados à Organização Mundial de Saúde no último dia do ano passado. \r\nUma semana depois, já em 2020, estava identificado um novo Coronavírus (2019-nCoV) que pôs a cidade de quarentena e espalhou o alarme pela província berço de Mao, contagiando depois o resto do Mundo, primeiro com o corte de várias ligações aéreas internacionais para evitar que o vírus viajasse. Ainda assim, poucos dias depois do alarme havia mais de seis mil casos em toda a China central, centena e meia de mortes, e o registo de casos em Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan e outros países asiáticos, mas também na Austrália, nos Estados Unidos, na América do Sul e na Europa.\r\nEsperava-se que 15 milhões de pessoas passassem por Wuham durante o período das miniférias do Ano Novo chinês - talvez muitas pudessem ter ido a poucos quilómetros a norte ao sítio arqueológico de Panlongcheng, que data da dinastia Shang, entre 1600 e 1046 a.C. Os gastos com entretenimento e transporte, segundo a S&P Global, devem cair 10 por cento por causa do Coronavírus.\r\nCidade histórica\nWuhan tem mais habitantes que Portugal. Ali vivem cerca de 11 milhões de pessoas, apesar de tudo número pouco expressivo para os padrões chineses: é apenas a sétima cidade mais populosa da China quando classificada por população da área urbana. \r\nMas Wuhan tem uma importância vital na saúde económica do país - situada na confluência do rio Yangtze e do seu maior afluente, o rio Han, com 1500 quilómetros de extensão, é um importante centro de comunicação e distribuição para toda a China central e também para os principais parceiros económicos. Dali seguem as redes de transporte fluvial, aéreo e ferroviário que participam na engrenagem do crescimento da segunda maior economia do Mundo. \r\nO centro económico, político e comercial da região é frequentemente chamado de a ‘via da China’ e economistas preveem que o impacto no Produto Interno Bruto chinês da quarentena parcial imposta pelo Coronavírus seja, pelo menos, de um por cento - caso a emergência não se perpetue muito para além das comemorações do Ano Novo chinês, a 25 de janeiro último, cujo tradicional feriado foi este ano comemorado com máscara protetora no rosto ou em casa, como impuseram as autoridades.\r\nEm 2019, o crescimento do PIB de Wuhan foi de 7,8 por cento, 1,7 pontos percentuais acima da média nacional. O valor total das importações e exportações alcançou 244 mil milhões de yuans (cerca de 40 mil milhões de euros), um recorde que foi de 13,7 por cento acima do ano anterior e representou 61,9 por cento do valor total do comércio exterior da província.\r\nMais de 300 das 500 maiores empresas do mundo estão presentes na cidade, incluindo a Microsoft. Nos últimos anos, Wuhan investiu para se tornar num centro de alta tecnologia, especialmente para a indústria ótica. Ainda assim a sua reputação como a ‘cidade automóvel’ da China nunca esmoreceu, o seu impacto como grande centro logístico influencia sobremaneira a saúde económica da China de que chegou a ser brevemente e em duas ocasiões, a capital - em 1927 e novamente durante a terrível Segunda Guerra Sino-Japonesa, em 1937.\r\nMas já em 1911 Wuham tinha marcado a história daquele grande país, quando foi palco da chamada Revolta de Wuchang, que derrubou a última dinastia imperial. Quinze anos depois, as tropas comandadas por Chiang Kai-shek conquistaram a cidade, dando fôlego ao controlo do território pela aliança entre o seu Kuomintang (KMT) e o Partido Comunista, que compreendia já todo o sudeste do país. \r\nMas Wuhan foi também símbolo da divisão entre o KMT e os comunistas. A guerra com o Japão, que invadiu a China como parte dos seus planos expansionistas ainda antes da Segunda Guerra Mundial, pôs fim às tentativas de Chiang Kai-shek de unificar o país. Ante o avanço japonês, o governo do KMT viu-se obrigado a abandonar a capital, Nanjing, retirando-se para Wuhan e, depois, para a cidade remota de Chongqing.\r\nEm julho de 1967, no auge da Revolução Cultural, ocorreu o chamado ‘incidente de Wuhan’: um conflito armado entre dois grupos que lutavam pelo controlo da cidade. As duas forças opostas eram o ‘Milhão de Heróis’ e a ‘Sede Geral dos Operários de Wuhan’. \r\nO primeiro integrava 500 mil pessoas, principalmente trabalhadores qualificados, funcionários públicos e do partido, e foi apoiado pelo comandante da Região Militar de Wuhan, general Chen Zaidao. A ‘Sede Geral’, com outros tantos apoiantes, era composta por operários e estudantes da Guarda Vermelha. Envolveram-se numa guerra de propaganda visando obter o apoio da comunidade local - Mao era presidente do Comité Central do Partido Comunista da China e já tinha nadado nas águas do Yangtsé. \r\nDoze dias depois, a 28 de julho de 1966, os representantes da Guarda Vermelha escreveram a Mao, reivindicando rebelião e revolta para levar avante a Revolução Cultural. Muitas pessoas acusadas de serem contrarrevolucionárias foram constrangidas ao suicídio. \r\nDurante o ‘agosto vermelho’ de 1966, houve 1772 mortos só em Pequim. Em Xangai, houve 704 suicídios e 534 mortes relacionadas com a Revolução Cultural, em setembro. Em Wuhan registaram-se 62 suicídios e 32 assassínios.

HONG KONG — Scientists who infected monkeys with the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 have found that those that recovered developed effective immunity from the disease — a potentially important discovery in the race to develop a vaccine. \n But the researchers also found that the animals could become infected through their eyes, which means wearing a face mask may not be enough to protect people from the disease. \n Scientists around the world have been racing to develop a vaccine and the first clinical trials could be held in China and the US within a month. \n But a number of cases, where people who had tested negative for the disease and were discharged from hospital only to give a positive result a few days later, have cast doubt on the process. \n The rate of reoccurrence ranged from 0.1 to 1 per cent nationwide, according to China’s state media reports. However, in some provinces such as Guangdong up to 14 per cent of the discharged patients had reportedly returned to hospital because of the test results. \n If it turns out that these patients had been reinfected by the same virus, then vaccines will not prove effective. \n But the monkey experiment carried out by a team from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences may help dispel that fear. \n Details of the experiment were made available last Saturday (March 14) on bioRxiv, a website for studies pending peer review. \n Professor Qin Chuan wrote that his research team infected four rhesus monkeys with the Covid-19 strain and the animals started to show signs of sickness three days later. \n They developed a fever, started struggling to breath and lost their appetite and weight. \n On the seventh day of the experiment, Prof Qin euthanised one of the monkeys and found the virus had spread throughout its body from nose to bladder with visible damage to the lung tissues. \n The remaining monkeys, however, recovered gradually and eventually stopped showing symptoms. \n About a month later, after tests returned negative results and X-rays showed their internal organs had fully recovered, two monkeys were dosed with the virus through the mouth. \n The scientists recorded a temporary temperature rise, but other than that everything appeared to stay normal. \n Autopsies were performed on these two monkeys about two weeks later, and the researchers could not find a trace of the virus in their body. \n Meanwhile, very high antibody levels were detected after the second week, suggesting that the immune system was prepared to fight the disease. \n Prof Qin said the results would have “important implications in evaluating vaccine development”. \n The researchers argued that the positive test on some recovered patients may be down to some other cause rather than the patients becoming reinfected. \n “It may be attributed to ‘false negative’… test results before their discharge or the patients not making a full recovery even though they meet the criteria for a discharge,” they wrote. \n The animal experiment supports observations made by some doctors on the front line in the fight against the disease. \n Professor Zhong Nanshan, a leading government scientist, said in Guangzhou last week that they had found a strong presence of antibodies in recovered patients, which meant the virus could no longer use them as a carrier again. \n “Now the question everyone cares about is whether the close contacts and family members may be infected because (the patient) tested positive again. So far I have not seen any evidence,” Zhong said. \n Nonetheless, the government has taken precautions. From March 5, all patients discharged from hospitals need to stay in a quarantine facility for another two weeks. \n A doctor, who works at a public hospital in Beijing looking after Covid-19 patients, said the experiment provided valuable information because monkeys are genetically close to humans but “what happens on monkeys does not always work on us”. \n The doctor also said that a recent case in Japan has caused “some concerns in medical circles” after the health authorities reported that a 70-year-old patient who had recovered was hospitalised again for developing Covid-19 symptoms such as fever and difficulty breathing. \n In a separate experiment involving three monkeys, Prof Qin and colleagues also found evidence to suggest people could be infected through the eyes. \n Dr Wang Guangfa, a senior medical expert from Beijing, was infected after a trip to Wuhan to investigate the early outbreak despite wearing a face mask and other protective gear. \n Dr Wang suspected that the virus entered into his body through the eyes as he wiped sweat from his forehead, but had no evidence to support the theory. \n He later recovered at home in Beijing with relatively mild symptoms. \n To verify the theory, Prof Qin and colleagues dropped a solution containing the virus into two monkeys’ eyes. \n To their surprise, the researchers did not find the virus on the surface of the monkeys’ eyes the next day. But several days later, both animals tested positive. \n Further investigations showed that the viral strain might have landed on the conjunctiva, a tissue lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white of the eye, and then travelled through the tear duct before ending up in the upper throat. \n However, the infection suffered by the monkeys appeared to be less severe than that of another animal that had caught the virus through the throat, according to another paper posted by Prof Qin on bioRxiv last Saturday. \n According to several other recent studies, the new coronavirus can survive in the air or on metal surfaces for days. \n The scientists wrote that their findings suggested that people should be more aware of the need to protect their eyes. \n They argued transmission could be cut by “regular hand-washing in daily life and wearing protective eyewear when in close contact with patients or in crowded places, especially for clinicians”. SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST \n "}, {"content": "China's controversial quarantine measures worked, prominent epidemiologist argues. BEIJING (CAIXIN GLOBAL) - China's controversial quarantine measures limited the size of the country's Covid-19 outbreak and should be kept in place until late April, according to a study by a prominent Chinese epidemiologist. \n The study, led by Dr Zhong Nanshan, who has spearheaded China's effort against Covid-19, was published last month in China's Journal of Thoracic Disease, of which he is editor-in-chief. It defended various measures taken by China since late January to control the spread of the virus, including citywide lockdowns, forced quarantines and shutdowns of public transportation. \n Critics have charged that these moves were ineffective, violate the rights of individuals, and were too late to materialise after the discovery of the virus, and initial efforts to warn the public of its danger were suppressed. \n Yet Dr Zhong argued that these measures managed to quickly reduce the number of new cases. The study said that they also cut both the number of peak \"active infections,\" which refers to the number of people ill at the height of a region's epidemic, and the predicted total number of infections by the end of the epidemic. \n Nevertheless, at a Feb 27 press conference in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong province, Dr Zhong said that the paper had been rejected by at least one \"authoritative\" overseas medical journal, though he did not say which or why. \n Using a version of the \"susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered\" mathematical modelling technique, the study predicted that with the quarantine measures in force at the time of its publication, the epidemic in China would peak on Feb 28 with 59,764 cumulative active infections, dwindle by late April and result in about 122,122 cases in total by the end of the epidemic. \n This contrasts with modelling done by overseas infectious disease experts, with one study estimating the country's Covid-19 cases would reach 160,000 by early February. While Dr Zhong's figures more closely match China's official case numbers, Caixin has previously reported that the official tally excludes a significant portion of people who have tested positive for Covid-19, namely those without symptoms. \n According to Dr Zhong's team, a five-day delay in implementing the country's various lockdowns would have tripled the total number of infections in the country. Taken five days earlier, the measures would have cut the number of cases nationwide by two-thirds. \n Meanwhile the paper predicted that infections in Hubei, the province hardest hit by the outbreak, would peak on Feb 20 at 42,792 cases, then grow to a total of 59,578 by late April, when the outbreak is expected to near its end. \n Had interventions been delayed, both Hubei's active infections and total cases would have been over 2.6 times the current projected amount. Had the interventions been introduced five days earlier, the epidemic peak should have arrived five days earlier, with the total case number not exceeding 25,000. \n The study argues that if Hubei had ended its restrictions on movement after the extended Chinese New Year holiday concluded in early February, the province would have had a second peak in infections in March. \n The authors found similar trends for Guangdong and Zhejiang, two other provinces hit hard by the virus. \n \"The continued policy of 'early detection' and subsequent isolation might be effective in preventing a second epidemic wave in Guangdong and Zhejiang,\" the study said. \n The paper cautions that the return of migrants to Chinese cities, broadened testing and climate factors could affect the number of cases and that \"the policy of strict monitoring and early detection should remain in place until the end of April 2020.\" \n This story was originally published by Caixin Global. \n "}, {"content": "US summons Chinese envoy over coronavirus comments. WASHINGTON • The US State Department summoned the Chinese ambassador to the United States last Friday to protest against Beijing's comments suggesting the US military might have brought the new coronavirus to Wuhan, as tensions between the two global powers over the outbreak intensified. \n Mr David Stillwell, the top US diplomat for East Asia, delivered a \"stern representation\" to China's Ambassador Cui Tiankai, a State Department official said, adding that Mr Cui was \"very defensive\". \n The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said China was seeking to deflect criticism of its role in \"starting a global pandemic and not telling the world\". \"Spreading conspiracy theories is dangerous and ridiculous. We wanted to put the government on notice we won't tolerate it for the good of the Chinese people and the world.\" \n United States Defence Department spokesman Alyssa Farah wrote on Twitter last Friday that \"the Communist Party of China has chosen to promulgate false & absurd conspiracy theories about the origin of Covid-19 blaming US service members. #ChinaPropaganda\". \n The Chinese Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. \n Despite the tension, US President Donald Trump last Friday praised Beijing for its \"data sharing\". Asked by a reporter during a White House news conference about \"odd narratives\" being offered by some Chinese officials, Mr Trump appeared to brush off any concern, saying he had read one article on the subject, but that he did not think it was representative of his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping. \n Mr Trump, who last week called the outbreak a \"foreign virus\" started in China, added: \"They know where it came from, we all know where it came from.\" \n Tensions escalated after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian took to Twitter last Thursday: \"When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!\" \n Mr Zhao's comments came days after Mr Robert O'Brien, the US national security adviser, said China had reacted slowly to the coronavirus, probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also complained that the US response had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from Beijing. \n The coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, hitting financial markets, bringing some flights to a standstill, closing schools and forcing the postponement of many major events. \n REUTERS \n "}, {"content": "Pessoas com passaporte português retidas em cruzeiro “não estão em risco especial”.

Die mysteriöse Pandemie mit Grippe-Symptomen reißt immer mehr Opfer in den Tod.\nMEV-1 heißt das Virus, das in dem Hollywood-Thriller „Contagion“ zur globalen Bedrohung wird. Vor neun Jahren brachte US-Regisseur Steven Soderbergh den Katastrophenfilm mit Stars wie Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet und Marion Cotillard ins Kino.\nDurch die Coronavirus-Krise ist der sachlich inszenierte Thriller plötzlich bei Streaming-Diensten wieder stark gefragt. Was 2011 noch packende Unterhaltung war, hat nun einen bitteren Beigeschmack. Die Covid-19-Pandemie mit rapide steigender Zahl von Infizierten und Toten zeigt immer mehr Parallelen mit Katastrophenszenarien „Made in Hollywood“. Und das Coronavirus lehrt die Entertainment-Branche jetzt das Fürchten.\nAusgerechnet Hollywood-Liebling Tom Hanks und seine Ehefrau Rita Wilson überraschten als erstes Promi-Paar mit der Nachricht, dass sie beide mit Sars-CoV-2 infiziert sind. Der Unterhaltungsbetrieb liegt quasi lahm. Film- und TV-Produktionen werden gestoppt, Kinostarts weltweit abgesagt, Messen und Festivals gecancelt. Branchenexperten rechnen mit Kinokasseneinbußen von bis zu 20 Milliarden Dollar in diesem Jahr, wenn sich der Stillstand über mehrere Monate hinzieht.\nDer erste Einbruch kam schon im Januar mit der Schließung der Kinos in China, dem Ursprungsland des neuartigen Virus, zugleich der zweitgrößte Kinomarkt nach USA und Kanada. Im Februar dann das vorläufige Aus für Tom Cruise und „Mission: Impossible 7“. Drei Wochen lang wollte Regisseur Christopher McQuarrie in Italien drehen, wo schon das Virus grassierte.\nEs geht Schlag auf Schlag weiter: Anfang März wird der Start des neuen James-Bond-Films „No Time to Die“ um sieben Monate auf November verschoben - „nach sorgfältiger Überlegung und gründlicher Bewertung des weltweiten Kinomarktes“, so die nüchterne Begründung. Wegen des Coronavirus war zuvor schon die gesamte Werbetour in China abgesagt worden.\nIn den letzten Tagen trifft es weitere Blockbuster: \"Fast & Furious 9\", \"The New Mutants\", \"Mulan\", \"Peter Hase 2\", \"A Quiet Place 2\". Fans müssen sich nun länger gedulden, bis diese Filme ins Kino kommen. John Krasinski, Regisseur des Horrorfilms \"A Quiet Place 2\", kommentierte den Aufschub auf Instagram. Seinen Film sollte man zusammen mit anderen Leuten im Kino erleben. \"Jetzt ist offensichtlich nicht die richtige Zeit dafür.\" Nach China, Italien und Polen machen auch in anderen Ländern immer mehr Lichtspielhäuser dicht.\nIn den USA bleiben die meisten Kinos vorerst noch geöffnet, doch sie geben nur die Hälfte der Tickets aus, um mehr Platz und damit mehr Abstand zwischen den Besuchern zu schaffen. Die Hollywoodstudios setzen die Empfehlung „Social Distancing“, also auf Distanz zueinander gehen, um Ansteckungen zu vermeiden, radikal um.\nDas Disney-Studio gab am Freitag einen massiven Drehstopp bekannt, Begegnungen am Set werden damit vermieden. Betroffen sind unter anderem Großprojekte wie „The Little Mermaid“, Guillermo del Toros „Nightmare Alley“ und Ridley Scotts Historiendrama „The Last Duel“ mit Matt Damon und Ben Affleck. Der Streaming-Dienst Netflix will vorsichtshalber mindestens für zwei Wochen die Produktion von Filmen und TV-Shows in den USA und Kanada einstellen.\nDer positive Coronavirus-Test bei Tom Hanks hatte am Set in Australien zum sofortigen Abbruch der neuen Produktion von Regisseur Baz Luhrmann geführt. Das Biopic vom Studio Warner Bros. ist eine noch titellose Filmbiografie über die Rock'n'Roll-Legende Elvis Presley, in der Hanks dessen Manager Colonel Tom Parker spielt. Der zweifache Oscar-Preisträger und seine Frau hatten die Diagnose am Donnerstag in den sozialen Medien bekannt gegeben. Sie seien nun in Quarantäne und würden „jeden Tag nehmen, wie er kommt“, gab Hanks betont locker von sich.\nBranchenexperten in Hollywood geben unterdessen eine düstere Prognose. Sie rechnen schon die möglichen Milliardenverluste durch die Corona-Krise hoch. 20 Milliarden Dollar könnten allein an den Kinokassen in diesem Jahr fehlen, vor allem, wenn die lukrativen ausländischen Märkte einbrechen, berichtete am Freitag das Filmblatt „Hollywood Reporter“. 2019 flossen weltweit noch mehr als 42 Milliarden Dollar in Hollywoods Kassen.\nAbgesagt ist auch schon die jährliche Fachmesse CinemaCon, bei der die Filmtheaterbranche Ende März in Las Vegas die neuesten Hollywoodprojekte vorstellen wollte. Auch die renommierten Filmfestivals Tribeca in New York und das Internationale Film Festival in San Francisco (beide für April geplant) sind abgesagt geworden. Das sind schlechte Vorboten für Cannes, wo die 73. Filmfestspiele Mitte Mai (noch) auf dem Plan stehen. Eine Absage würde die schon kränkelnde internationale Branche schwer treffen.

KATHMANDU - Nepal has closed all of its Himalayan peaks including Mount Everest this climbing season because of fears of the coronavirus outbreak, a government minister said on Friday.  \n Nepal, home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains including Mount Everest, gets more than four million dollars in permit fees for the world's highest peak and other mountains every year.  \n Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai said expeditions to all peaks in the March-May spring season had been suspended.  \n \"Climbing this season has been closed,” Bhattarai told Reuters.  \n \"It is as a precaution for that,\" he added, when asked it its was because of the coronavirus.  \n Nepal has confirmed just one case of the coronavirus - a student studying in China on a trip home - out of 450 people tested.  \n The suspension of expeditions in Nepal will affect hundreds of foreign climbers now preparing for the spring season, a window or relatively good weather between the end of the bitterly cold winter and the rainy season, which begins in June.  \n Everest, the world's highest mountain at 8,850 meters (29,035 feet), is on the border between Nepal and the Chinese region of Tibet. China announced the closure of its side of the mountain on Thursday.  \n It is the second time in recent years that the climbing season has been disrupted.

GENEVA/DUBAI - All countries need to prepare to combat the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said on Thursday, as authorities raced to contain the epidemic's rapid global spread and Wall Street looked set for its biggest weekly fall since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.  \n With new infections reported around the world now surpassing those in mainland China, World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said even rich nations should prepare.  \n \"No country should assume it won't get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally,\" Tedros said, pointing to Italy, where 17 people have died in Europe's worst outbreak.  \n In addition to stockpiling medical supplies, governments ordered schools shut and cancelled big gatherings, including sports events, to try to halt spread of the flu-like disease known as COVID-19 that emerged in central China more than two months ago from an illegal wildlife market.  \n The death rate appears to be around 2 percent, although it could be lower if there are many mild, undiagnosed cases, experts say.  \n By comparison, seasonal influenza has a case fatality rate of around 0.1%, said Anthony Fauci, Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, ahead of a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence, who has been put in charge of coordinating the U.S. response.  \n \"So therefore you have somewhat of a serious potential for morbidity and mortality,\" he said, adding, \"We're dealing with a serious virus.\"  \n There is particular concern over a case in Japan in which a woman tested positive for the virus for a second time. Second positive tests have also been reported in China and could imply contracting the disease does not confer immunity. Scientists warned that much remains unknown about this new virus.  \n The head of the WHO's emergency program, Dr. Mike Ryan, said discussions were being held with organizers about the fate of the 2020 Olympics, scheduled for July in Tokyo, although no decision was expected soon.  \n Their cancellation or relocation would be a massive blow for Japan, which said it was closing its entire school system for the next month in a bid to prevent spread of the virus.  \n The virus has so far mainly battered China, causing nearly 80,000 infections and more than 2,700 deaths, according to WHO figures. It has spread to another 46 countries, where around 3,700 cases and 57 deaths have been reported.  \n \"This virus has pandemic potential,\" Tedros told reporters in Geneva. He said Iran, Italy and South Korea were at a \"decisive point,\" but still short of sustained community transmission.  \n  \n MARKET SELLOFF  \n Spooked by the impact on China, the heart of corporate supply chains, and the increasing effect on other countries, stocks sank deeper into the red on Thursday and oil prices fell.  \n Global equity markets have dropped for six straight days, wiping out more than $3.6 trillion in value <.MIWD00000PUS>.  \n The S&P 500 <.SPX> finished 12% below its Feb. 19 record close, marking its fastest correction ever in just six trading days, while the Dow registered a record one-day points drop, which was also its fourth 1,000-point decline in history and the second this week.  \n Jeremy Farrar, a specialist in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, urged finance institutions to commit an initial $10 billion funds to fighting the virus.  \n \"What we are really missing is tangible, high-level funding and support from global financial institutions,\" he said in a statement. \"The possible impact of this coronavirus is far beyond a health emergency - it's a global crisis with potential to reach the scale of the global financial crisis of 2008.\"  \n Traders are betting the U.S. Federal Reserve will move aggressively to cut borrowing costs in coming months in response to the effects of the coronavirus on the economy.  \n Politicians are also scrambling to respond.  \n President Donald Trump's administration was considering invoking special powers to rapidly expand U.S. production of protective gear, two officials told Reuters.  \n California's governor complained that the state was monitoring over 8,000 people but had only 200 test kits.  \n President Emmanuel Macron attempted to rally the nation as France's number of reported cases doubled.  \n \"We have a crisis before us. An epidemic is on its way,\" Macron said.  \n Germany, too, has warned of an impending epidemic. And Greece, a gateway for refugees from the Middle East and beyond, announced tighter border controls.  \n There is no cure for the coronavirus, which can lead to pneumonia, and a vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop.  \n  \n MISINFORMATION 'EPIDEMIC'  \n Iran extended closures of cinemas, cultural events and conferences for another week and called off Friday prayers in some cities.  \n The WHO's Ryan said Iran's outbreak may be worse than realized. It has suffered the highest death toll outside China, with 26 dead, suggesting there are likely many more cases than the 245 reported, which includes some senior officials.  \n Italy, desperate to stave off a probable recession, warned that an \"epidemic of misleading information\" could do worse harm than the virus itself.  \n The coronavirus has played havoc with global aviation and tourism as airlines cancel flights, countries ban visitors from hot spots and nervous passengers put off travel.  \n Chinese authorities said the number of new deaths there stood at 29, its lowest daily tally since Jan. 28.

There is really no other option at the moment. However, we can tell you something that might cheer you up even in this grim period.\nYou've read about Survival Of The Fittest enough and it is time to implement it now. Why? Because we have to survive this pandemic without any sort of help. For those living alone, especially. It is taxing because there is literally no help.

Think about the fact that you will not have to choose between the white shirt or that red lipstick - you can actually just buy both without batting an eyelid.\nNO CONVEYANCE EXPENSES\nCab aggregators Uber and Ola have suspended their services and public transport isn't available as well. Moreover, you are working from home and aren't even stepping out for recreation. So, no expenses for conveyance either. Make no mistake, because you are saving big time here.\nNO RECREATIONAL EXPENSES\nWhen was the last time you opened your wardrobe and wore a fancy dress for an outing? Well, the answer should explain that our only outing has been from the bedroom to the kitchen and vice-versa and that too, in our pyjamas. No partying with friends.

Singapore, a tiny city-state of less than 6 million people, had one of the earliest and biggest clusters of cases of the coronavirus in early February, before it began its rapid, inexorable expansion around the globe.\nWithin weeks, the country's tally of infections with the highly contagious virus that causes COVID-19 was overtaken by skyrocketing caseloads in South Korea, several European countries and the U.S.\nSome strategies are proving more effective than others in containing the pandemic: pro-active efforts to track down and isolate the infected, access to basic, affordable public health care, and clear, reassuring messaging from leaders. East Asia's experience with the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China, has likewise helped.\nSince testing rates vary widely, it's hard to know for sure. But Singapore appears to be among the handful of places that tick all those boxes, though recent spikes in new cases show that any lapses can have dire consequences.\nSingapore's first case, confirmed on Jan. 23, was a 66-year-old man from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the disease was first detected in late December.\nBy mid-February, the number of recovered patients in the Southeast Asian city-state was outpacing new ones. That changed in early March after 47 cases were tracked to a Feb. 15 dinner gathering. As of Wednesday, Singapore had 266 confirmed cases and no deaths from the virus.\nAs new infections increased, the government tightened quarantine controls.\nTaiwan, a self-governed island off the coast of mainland China, has confirmed just 77 cases and one death. Most recent cases were residents returning from overseas travel.\nHong Kong has reported 167 cases and four deaths. Its leader, Carrie Lam, on Tuesday warned against all outbound travel and said any people arriving from outside greater China will face 14-day home quarantines or medical surveillance.\nOf the 13 cases found in the tiny gambling enclave of Macao, 10 have recovered. Casinos have been closed for weeks to battle the outbreak.\nCambodia, which has confirmed a dozen cases, last weekend moved to stop foreigners traveling from France, the U.S., Spain, Germany, Italy and Iran after several new cases were found among travelers.\nThailand, likewise, appears to have kept cases under control with aggressive public health campaigns intended to minimize infections, though new cases jumped recently as stepped-up testing found clusters linked to a boxing tournament and an evening gathering at a bar. So far, 177 cases have been confirmed among 70 million Thais, even though it's a top destination for travelers, especially from China.\nAssuming the numbers reported to the World Health Organization are accurate, many of the countries with lower caseloads are relatively isolated geographically: Singapore, New Zealand, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Mongolia. Some others may be latecomers in testing and reporting: Russia, Indonesia, Vietnam.\nFor Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the experience of battling the 2003 SARS outbreak, which infected some 8,000 people and killed nearly 800, helped ensure residents took the risks seriously, experts say.\n\"Almost everyone played ball and followed accordingly,\" said Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. \"SARS was our baptism by fire and we were forced to learn everything by swimming in the deep end of the pool.\"\nAfter the SARS outbreak, when 238 people were infected and 33 died in Singapore, the city revamped its already excellent health care system, writing up new protocols for containing outbreaks. It set up \"fever centers\" to isolate suspected cases, invested in equipment and improved training in handling infectious diseases, Leong said. So when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered, Singapore was ready to act, he said.\nFrom Feb. 1, Singapore blocked entry and transit for new visitors who had traveled to mainland China within 14 days. These restrictions have since expanded to include visitors with recent travel to Iran, northern Italy or South Korea.\nWhen the number of local cases without links to previous cases or travel in China surged, the government raised its alert to \"orange,\" the second-highest level, on Feb. 7. The Singapore Air Show, a huge event that draws thousands, scaled back the number of participants and barred most exhibitors and visitors from China from attending. Good hygiene and avoiding handshakes were recommended.\nThe National Public Health Laboratory, set up after SARS, was prepared to fast-track testing, using advanced diagnostics and newly developed COVID-19 test kits.\nRapid testing and isolation of suspected cases, and painstaking tracing of contacts, helped by police, surveillance videos and ATM records, have helped prevent a worse local outbreak, said Tikki Pangestu, a visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and former director of WHO's research policy and cooperation department.\nOnce a COVID-19 case is confirmed, Singapore embarks on \"diligent contract tracing,\" said Pangestu. It ordered workers arriving from countries with endemic virus infections to stay home. Worship services were suspended in favor of livestreaming after a cluster was found at a church. Schools suspended mass assemblies and staggered recess.\nSo far, 5,700 people have been quarantined.\nIn Thailand, too, public health workers have gone door-to-door to track down contacts, said Thanarak Plipat, deputy director-general of the Disease Control Department of the Health Ministry. \"We must go see them ourselves. This is an old public health way. We do our best,\" he said.\nIt has mostly worked. But newly confirmed clusters show one dinner, one boxing match or one religious gathering can undo weeks of work.\nInitially, Germany was thought to have done relatively well at slowing the spread, but infections there have jumped to 9,360.\nIn South Korea, where more than 270,000 people have been tested, newly discovered cases are dropping sharply, but clusters are still popping up, at a call center, at a church.\nThis week, Malaysia has reported a surge in cases linked to a religious gathering in its capital last week. Cambodia, Thailand and Indonesia also have confirmed new cases linked to that gathering.\nIt's unclear if the strategies used in an authoritarian society like Singapore would work in bigger countries whose citizens expect greater personal freedoms: In March, a Chinese couple was charged under Singapore's Infectious Diseases Act for misinforming health officials and obstructing contact tracing. If convicted, they may be imprisoned or fined.\nBut as virus controls expand to unprecedented levels in many other countries, the policies are looking prescient.\nSingapore is a small island with strong public trust in the government, \"a strong healthcare system, excellent information systems and plenty of money,\" said Pangestu. \"Many other countries, especially developing ones, do not have these capacities or characteristics.\"\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, lauded for adopting a calming, clear approach early on, said in a televised talk last week that the situation was under control but the government was planning ahead, trying to free up hospital beds to be prepared for any surge in cases.\nSingaporeans \"feel we are all in this together,\" Lee said, \"and we don't leave anyone behind.\"\n"}, {"content": "Jovem com deficiência morre na China após o pai ficar em quarentena devido ao coronavírus.

WASHINGTON (AFP) - The US will begin screening passengers on Friday (Jan 17) arriving from a Chinese city at the heart of a mysterious Sars-linked virus, officials said, after an outbreak that has stricken dozens claimed a second life. \n Three confirmed cases, meanwhile, have now been reported outside China - two in Thailand and one in Japan - even as health authorities around the world sought to assure the public that the overall risk of infection remained low. \n Martin Cetron, a senior official at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told reporters: \"To further protect the health of the American public during the emergence of this novel coronavirus, CDC is beginning entry screening at three ports of entry.\" \n These are San Francisco airport and New York's JFK, which both receive direct flights, as well as Los Angeles, the biggest destination for connecting flights, he said, adding: \"We're expecting that the screening over the next couple of weeks could include as many as 5000 people\" beginning Friday night. \n Incoming travellers will be asked to fill out a questionnaire and submit to a temperature check, with those showing possible signs of infection sent on to another facility for a diagnostic test that could take up to a day. \n The move came after Chinese officials said the infection had claimed its second death: a 69-year-old man who died on Wednesday in Wuhan, the central Chinese city believed to be the epicentre of an outbreak of the pathogen from the same family as the deadly Sars virus. \n No human-to-human transmission has been confirmed so far, but Wuhan's health commission has said the possibility \"cannot be excluded.\" \n The enigmatic illness has caused alarm because of its connection to Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n Pneumonia linked to the new virus has hit at least 41 people in China, with the outbreak centered around a seafood market in Wuhan. \n Of these 12 have recovered and been discharged from hospital, according to the Wuhan health commission, while five others are in a serious condition. \n The second man to die became sick on Dec 31 and his condition worsened two weeks ago, it said, with the disease causing pulmonary tuberculosis and damage to multiple organ functions. \n Thailand reported its second case of the coronavirus on Friday: a 74-year-old Chinese woman who had arrived from Wuhan earlier this week. \n Her condition is improving, said Thai health officials, who urged people not to panic as there was \"no spread of the virus\" in the South-east Asian country. \n That sentiment was echoed by senior CDC official Nancy Messonnier, who said: \"For families sitting around the dinner table tonight, this is not something that they generally need to worry about.\" \n Yet, much remains to be understood about the \"2019 novel coronavirus\" or \"2019-nCoV,\" according to the CDC, which added that \"there are indications that some limited person-to-person spread may have occurred.\" \n The latest fatality comes as China prepares for its busiest travel season of the year next week, when millions of people take buses, trains and planes for Chinese New Year. \n China has not announced any travel restrictions but authorities in Hong Kong have stepped up detection measures, including rigorous temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers. \n The Wuhan health commission said one man who had been diagnosed worked at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, but his wife, who also had the virus, reported \"no history of exposure\" at the facility. \n The first case in Thailand had not reported visiting the seafood market, the WHO said Tuesday. The woman was reported to be in a stable condition earlier this week. \n The patient in Japan, who was released from hospital, had also not visited the market. Japanese officials said it was possible that the man had been in contact with a person infected with the virus while in Wuhan. \n After the second death was reported, online discussion spread in China over the severity of the Wuhan coronavirus - and how much information the government is hiding from the public. \n Several complained about censorship of online posts, while others made comparisons to 2003, when Beijing drew criticism from the WHO for under-reporting the number of Sars cases. \n \"It's so strange,\" wrote a web user on the social media platform Weibo, citing the overseas cases in Japan and Thailand. \"They all have Wuhan pneumonia cases but (in China) we don't have any infections outside of Wuhan - is that scientific?\" \n But the CDC's Messonnier thanked her Chinese counterparts for quickly identifying the pathogen and making its genome publicly available to scientists around the world, allowing them to rapidly develop diagnostic tools. \n "}, {"content": "Angola entre os 13 países de prioridade máxima para vigilância devido ao coronavírus.

All public hospital emergency departments here are in \"outbreak response mode\" as Singapore raises its defences against a mysterious, Sars-like virus that is spreading in China. \n \"We cannot rule out the possibility that the new (Wuhan) virus will reach Singapore,\" Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), told The Straits Times. The stakes are higher now that the virus has started spreading from human to human. \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. All general practice doctors have also been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspect patients. \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID. Those 16 and younger will be taken to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. This is to nip the spread of the virus in the bud. The ambulance will then be properly cleaned before it is used again. \n At the NCID, the patients will be placed in special negative pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters. \n Prof Leo said the NCID has \"high-end\" Hepa filters in 124 negative pressure isolation rooms which clean 99.999 per cent of contaminants, including viruses. \n As an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays. \n It will take the laboratory between four and eight hours to determine if the patient is infected with a coronavirus. If that test proves positive, genetic sequencing will be done to confirm that it is the new bug. That takes 24 hours. \n Prof Leo said there are a lot of coronaviruses but only seven, including this new one, that spread from human to human. \n Four types cause the common cold and are mild. The other two are the more dangerous Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). \n Fifteen medical staff in Wuhan have contracted the bug, currently called the 2019-nCoV. \n Prof Leo said that it is not yet known whether this virus is as dangerous as Sars. \n But Singapore is not taking chances. All medical staff dealing with suspected cases are well protected with personal protective equipment (PPE). Laboratory staff will also have PPE and powered air purifying respirators - to filter out any possible virus. \n Prof Leo said Singapore has a stockpile of the disposable PPE as well as the powered air purifying respirators - enough to supply all hospitals should a major outbreak occur here. \"Yes it is expensive, but protection of staff is the most important thing,\" said Prof Leo, a veteran of the Sars outbreak in 2003, when medical staff caring for infected patients were among the 238 people infected and the 33 who died. \n The 330-bed NCID, which opened slightly over a year ago, has more than 100 \"surge beds\" which are kept empty and on standby for national emergencies. \n Although the flu vaccine does not protect against the Wuhan bug, she said it is a good idea to get vaccinated. On a national level, it will \"cut down on the background noise\". \n She added that should there be a positive case of the Wuhan bug here, people will be told. \n \"We need to be able to share the information and be able to guide the public, as well as the entire public healthcare system, to be able to handle the situation,\" she said. \n WIDER DEFINITION \n Singapore's Ministry of Health has widened its definition of suspect cases, and it will now include anyone with pneumonia who had been to China - not just Wuhan - within 14 days of the start of the illness. Anyone with acute respiratory infection who has been to any hospital in China within a fortnight of getting ill will also be treated as a suspect case. \n MORE SCREENINGS \n From today, Changi Airport will conduct temperature screening for all flights from China, and not just those from Wuhan. So far, all seven suspected cases in Singapore have proven not to have the Wuhan bug. \n SUSPECT CASES \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. At the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), the patients will be placed in special negative pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters.

Climate scientists tell us that climate change will not only bring about rising sea levels and more extreme weather events, it also increases the likelihood of epidemics. But despite the clear linkage between the two, our response to the current Covid-19 pandemic is almost completely opposite to our usual response to climate change. \n While the coronavirus can be fatal, the risk that one will die from the disease is (still) low. Nonetheless, governments in hard hit areas have acted promptly to declare “war” on the pandemic while societies have made large sacrifices to contain the disease. \n With climate change, while the impacts are far greater in terms of loss of lives and risk to the very survival of the human species, mitigating climate change is seldom a priority in a government’s resource allocation decisions. \n In short, we respond to epidemics (when they occur) with excessive fear and pessimism, even as we routinely discount the risks of, and are naively optimistic about, the very thing that makes them more likely. \n In dealing with low-probability, high-dread events such as dying from Covid-19, we systemically overestimate our risks — much like how people overestimate their risks of dying in a terrorist attack or a plane crash relative to far more common causes of death. \n On the other hand, people and institutions underestimate the high (and increasing) risk of climate catastrophe. How do we explain this paradox? \n PROBABILITY NEGLECT, PRESENT BIAS AND GLOBAL COMMONS \n Our overestimation of risks linked to the coronavirus and our underestimation of climate risks are two sides of the same coin; they are explained by a bias called probability neglect. \n When dealing with risks (whether the risk of an epidemic or of climate change), we do not rely on actual probabilities but on how easily the risk comes to mind (saliency bias), our instincts, and our instant emotive reactions (the affect heuristic). \n The coronavirus is very salient; we are constantly inundated by news of it and daily updates of the numbers infected and dead around the world. It also evokes strong emotional reactions, especially fear. Salience combined with fear causes us to believe that something is far more probable than it is. \n Climate change is exactly the opposite. It is usually not salient as most people believe it will occur in some distant future. Climate change also does not evoke strong emotional responses in most people, except possibly for the young. Being an abstraction for most people, climate risks are systematically underestimated. \n The result of our collective fear is that governments prioritise the “war” against the Covid-19 pandemic, often at the expense of other priorities. \n Global supply chains have also been disrupted; financial markets are roiled by the news of the disease spreading and of rising number of infections. \n The different responses to coronavirus and climate change also stem from what is known as present-biased preferences. People tend to overvalue immediate costs or benefits while discounting long-term impacts. \n In the case of the coronavirus, people are willing to make immediate sacrifices as there are short-term benefits, that of being protected from a potentially life-threatening disease.  \n With climate change, people are reluctant to incur even small costs today because the benefits (such as the survival of mankind and preservation of the natural environment) are in the future and, therefore, heavily discounted.  \n Climate change and epidemics are both problems of the global commons. Effective solutions require cooperation and coordination between governments.  \n But such cooperation is difficult because every country has an incentive to free ride on the efforts of others. \n With epidemics, this free-rider problem is less pronounced as the domestic costs of an epidemic are high enough for most governments to take some preventive measures. \n With climate change, the free-rider problem (and the consequent tragedy of commons) seems more insurmountable. \n The benefits of not taking any climate action are internalised (that is, the benefits are fully captured by the country not taking climate action), while the costs to the global commons are externalised (that is, the costs are shared or distributed to the rest of the world). \n LESSONS FOR CLIMATE ACTION \n First, there is an opportunity for those of us who wish to see more resolute climate action to use the coronavirus crisis to emphasise the causal link between climate change and epidemics.  \n Our message to governments and our fellow citizens should be: “If you do not wish to live with more of such viruses, we must take far more aggressive action on climate change.” \n Second, there are many things governments can do to highlight the salience of climate risks. \n For example, just as the number of confirmed infections and deaths from the coronavirus has been highly visible, governments should also provide regular information on the costs and damages of climate change, as well as how these are expected to rise. \n Third, governments can take steps to counter our present bias. With the coronavirus, the benefits of governments taking aggressive action now are clear for all to see.  \n With climate change, governments need to find ways to create a sense of crisis to persuade their populations that the costs of climate change are already upon us, and that the sacrifices needed to deal with it cannot be delayed anymore. \n Finally, the costs of climate change do not have to be fully internalised for countries to take action; they only need to be sufficiently internalised.  \n That the coronavirus began in China, the fastest growing emitter of carbon emissions, also creates an opportunity for China to play a leadership role in climate change mitigation. By doing so, China would also reduce the risks of future epidemics. \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Donald Low is senior lecturer and professor of practice in public policy at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where Xun Wu is professor and head of the Division of Public Policy.

Whether a country's developmental strategy is right depends on that country's situation, said the spokesman, citing China's progress over the past 70 years to become the world's second-largest economy, and lifting over 800 million people out of poverty. \n Those achievements were made under the leadership of the CCP and the \"system of socialism with Chinese characteristics\", benefiting not just China but the rest of the world. \"Though Mr Bilahari himself did not deny China's great achievements, he still criticised the political system and the leadership system that created them. Actually it is logically self-contradictory,\" added the spokesman. \n He added that the country has united around the CCP Central Committee headed by Chinese President Xi Jinping, its general secretary, since the 18th National Congress in 2012. \"China is striving hard to modernise the system and capacity for governance.

BEIJING — With millions of face masks, low interest loans and teams of medical experts, China is trying to paint itself as a Good Samaritan while deflecting criticism over its initial missteps in handling the Covid-19 coronavirus. \n Beijing has showered struggling European nations with aid as part of a diplomatic charm offensive. \n In recent weeks, it has also donated hundreds of thousands of surgical masks and test kits to the Philippines and Pakistan, sent teams of medics to Iran and Iraq, and extended a US$500 million loan to help Sri Lanka combat the virus. \n While Covid-19 first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December, Beijing says it has now curbed its spread, with new domestic cases dwindling to zero on Thursday. \n But as other governments now scramble to cope with the pandemic, China is sending masks, medical supplies and experts. \n It comes as Beijing and Washington are engaged in a tit-for-tat public opinion war over China's recent mass expulsion of US journalists and President Donald Trump's continued use of the phrase \"Chinese virus\" to describe the coronavirus. \n Mr Trump slammed China for its lack of transparency over the pandemic that has now infected more than 240,000 worldwide, saying \"the world is paying a big price\" in a news conference on Thursday. \n China's foreign ministry hit back on Friday, saying the US was trying to \"shift the blame\" for the pandemic. \n With the US also battling the virus on its home turf, analysts say China is rushing to reposition itself as an alternative global leader. \n \"Now, with the US government under Trump failing to provide any meaningful international response and the EU occupied with national responses, it offers China's government a unique opportunity to step into the empty spot,\" said Dr Marina Rudyak, an expert in Chinese foreign aid at the University of Heidelberg. \n By doing so, China was also trying to rewrite the Covid-19 narrative, deflecting criticism of its initial attempts to cover up the outbreak and posing as the saviour of \"other countries who either delayed their response or were less prepared than China,\" added Dr Rudyak. \n President Xi Jinping pledged assistance to hardest-hit Italy and Spain in phone calls with their prime ministers, the official Xinhua news agency reported. \n EU ‘GRATEFUL’ \n Two Chinese medical teams were sent to Italy in a high-profile show of solidarity with the earliest European Union partner in Mr Xi's massive \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure project. \n Italy is now the second hardest-hit country in the world with more than 35,000 cases. \n EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter this week that China would ship two million masks to Europe \"immediately\" and expressed her gratitude to Premier Li Keqiang. \n She said the EU helped China in January, by donating equipment, and tweeted: \"Today, we're grateful for China's support.\" \n Beijing also sent medical equipment to Serbia this week after an appeal for help. \n \"It has turned out that without you Europe can hardly defend itself,\" Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told Beijing's ambassador as Chinese virus tests arrived. \n He said the country had been waiting for its \"Chinese brothers\". \n The EU — of which Serbia is not a member — announced a ban on the export of medical equipment on Sunday, a move slammed by Vucic. \n Xinhua said more aid and doctors from China would arrive in Serbia in the next few days. \n Beijing has in recent years challenged Brussels for influence in the Balkans, in particular through heavy loan-based infrastructure investment in cash-strapped countries. \n Other political allies which China has supported or supplied include a number of African nations. \n Meanwhile Mr Jack Ma, China's richest man, donated two millions masks to be distributed across Europe, with shipments having arrived in Belgium, Spain and Italy. \n Another million masks bound for France left China on Wednesday. \n A front-page commentary by the state-run People's Daily on Thursday emphasised China's role as a \"responsible major country\" that willingly cooperates with other nations. \n For some European countries, China's strategy appears to be working. \n \"There are competing narratives evolving in Europe.

LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Here are some key features of viruses and the new coronavirus that was identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December and is causing an outbreak of disease in China and beyond.\n* Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with “crown”-like spikes.\n* Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n* Like other coronaviruses, the newly identified China coronavirus is being transmitted from person-to-person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n* Infection with the newly identified virus has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and there are limited accounts that it may also be spreading before symptoms show.\n* Infectious disease and virus specialists say the scale of the current outbreak now points to “self-sustaining” human-to-human transmission. They estimate that each infected person is infecting, on average, two to three more people.\n* Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.\n* Genetic data suggest the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a “recombinant” virus strain.

That is home to a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, to which most of South Korea's cases have been traced after some members visited the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the disease emerged. \n The Seoul government asked prosecutors to launch a murder investigation into leaders of the church. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said that if founder Lee Man-hee and other heads of the church had cooperated, fatalities could have been prevented. \n Mr Lee knelt and apologised to the country, saying that one church member had infected many others and calling the epidemic a \"great calamity\". \n It was not immediately known how many of South Korea's dead were members of the church. \n 'OUTBREAKS ARE CURBED' \n But Wuhan itself, at the centre of the epidemic, shut the first of 16 specially built hospitals that were hurriedly put up to treat coronavirus cases, the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said. \n There was also a steep fall in new cases in Hubei, the province around Wuhan, but China remained on alert for people returning home with the virus from other countries. \n The virus broke out in Wuhan late last year and has since infected more than 86,500 people, mostly in China. \n Only eight cases were reported in China beyond Hubei on Sunday, the WHO said. \n China's UN Ambassador Zhang Jun at a news conference said: “We definitely believe that with the coming of spring we’re not far from the coming of the victory of the final defeat of Covid-19.” \n Outside China, there are now more than 8,700 infected and over 125 deaths. \n Iran, one of the worst-hit nations, reported infections rising to 1,501, with 66 deaths, including a senior official. With stocks of gloves and other medical supplies running low in pharmacies, authorities uncovered a hoard of supplies including millions of gloves. \n In Britain, which has 40 confirmed cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to be prepared for a further spread.

On Feb 18, just five weeks ago, I started my Budget 2020 speech setting out what we must do to combat the threats posed by the Covid-19 outbreak. At that time, there were 800 confirmed cases outside of China. \n The outbreak has escalated quickly. Three weeks after my Budget speech, on March 11, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Covid-19 a pandemic, recognising the severity and risk of further global spread. \n Today, the WHO estimates that the number of people infected has exceeded 410,000, across more than 190 countries. \n The Covid-19 outbreak is a battle on many fronts - medical, economic and social. \n First, on the medical front, countries are taking extraordinary measures to contain the spread of the virus, so that their healthcare systems are not overwhelmed. Many countries have implemented lockdowns, while the United States has declared a national emergency. \n In Singapore, we are doing everything we can to keep you and your families safe. We acted early and decisively. As the severity of the virus outbreak grew worldwide, we stepped up our measures. This has, so far, helped to keep the number of cases at manageable levels during the first wave. \n However, as much as we try, the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to take at least a year to be resolved, and the economic repercussions would last even longer. The world is seeing successive waves of infection, and importation of infections. We must be prepared to take further tougher measures. \n Yet, measures on the medical front to contain the pandemic, both in Singapore and around the world, have made the second front of the battle - the economic front - even more difficult. These public health measures have caused severe economic disruptions and uncertainties. As more countries implement their measures, the economic disruptions will be wider, deeper and more prolonged. \n The global economy is now facing both a supply and demand shock. \n On the supply side, supply chains have been disrupted as locked-down workers are unable to work. With highly integrated global supply chains, a disruption in any one part of the chain, or in any one country, will have knock-on effects worldwide. \n Passengers at Changi Airport on Monday, one in a protective suit, mask and shoe covers. The extraordinary situation of the pandemic calls for extraordinary measures, says Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat. PHOTO: REUTERS \n On the demand side, aggregate demand has fallen as people stay home and curtail spending. Consumer and business confidence are plunging in the face of growing uncertainties. \n The International Monetary Fund has downgraded its 2020 global growth forecast three times since January 2019, and flagged that a further downgrade is imminent in April. It added that it expects a recession at least as bad as during the 2008 global financial crisis. \n Global financial markets are being roiled by the mounting uncertainties and cutback in economic activity. Stock markets have come down from their peak some weeks ago. \n The S&P 500 index took only 22 trading days to fall by 30 per cent from its peak, making it the fastest drop of this magnitude in history. The key volatility indices in Europe and the US, which some call the \"fear index\", briefly reached levels last seen during the global financial crisis. \n Credit has tightened across the world, and the US yield curve has fallen below 1 per cent for the first time in history. The disruptions around the world will significantly curtail global demand, disrupt supply chains, and possibly lead to financial shocks. As an open economy that is highly integrated with the global economy, we will be deeply impacted by these global shocks. \n Based on advance gross domestic product (GDP) estimates released this morning, in the first quarter, the Singapore economy contracted by 10.6 per cent quarter on quarter, or 2.2 per cent year on year, reversing the 0.6 per cent growth in the previous quarter. \n This morning, the Ministry of Trade and Industry further downgraded Singapore's GDP growth forecast for 2020, from a range of minus 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent announced last month, to between minus 4 per cent and minus 1 per cent. \n This extraordinary situation calls for extraordinary measures. \n Last month, I committed $6.4 billion in the Unity Budget towards the Stabilisation and Support Package, the Care and Support Package, and to support our front-line agencies. \n Today, I will introduce measures worth over $48 billion in this Resilience Budget, to deal decisively with the situation at hand. This is over seven times of the first tranche. \n Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support our people in this battle, amounting to 11 per cent of our GDP. This is a landmark package, and a necessary response to a unique situation. \n The Government has sought and obtained the President's in-principle support to draw up to $17 billion from our past reserves to fund part of the Resilience Budget. \n The Resilience Budget focuses on three key areas: \n •First, save jobs, support workers and protect livelihoods. \n •Second, help enterprises overcome immediate challenges. \n •Third, strengthen economic and social resilience so that we can emerge intact and stronger. \n Let me now elaborate on our considerations for drawing on past reserves in this budget, and our fiscal position after the measures that I have put forth to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. \n Our reserves are our strategic asset, built up through the discipline and prudence of our people and political leaders, across generations. \n Our reserves serve as our bulwark against shocks and crises of an extraordinary nature. For a nation with no oil, no gas, no gold, no diamonds, or natural resources of any kind, it is remarkable that we have built this up. \n Our prudence and discipline in saving and growing our reserves give us the wherewithal to respond decisively when our nation faces extraordinary circumstances. \n Our founding fathers created a rigorous framework to ensure that such strategic assets are used only for the right purpose. We amended the Constitution in 1991 to provide for an elected president who is the custodian of our past reserves. \n Under Article 148A of the Constitution, the President can withhold her assent to any supply Bill if she is of the view that it is likely to draw on past reserves. \n Our principle is that each term of government must live within its means. Any additional spending that the government of the day proposes must be funded in a sustainable manner - recurrent expenditures should be funded from recurrent revenues. \n Past reserves can be drawn down only in exceptional circumstances, under a two-key system, if the President, after consulting the Council of Presidential Advisers, agrees with the Government's proposal to draw on the past reserves in exceptional situations. \n Despite political pressure to dip into the reserves, the Government has scrupulously upheld the principle that past reserves are to be used only for exceptional situations. \n Until now, the Government has drawn on past reserves only once, during the global financial crisis, when the President approved a draw of $4.9 billion to fund the Jobs Credit Scheme and special risk-sharing initiative. \n During that period, the Government also sought the President's concurrence to use $150 billion of past reserves to back the deposit guarantee scheme. I was at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) at that time. We had asked for this, and it took us a long time to deliberate on this. As it turned out, the guarantee was not triggered, and there was no draw on past reserves. \n The Covid-19 pandemic, and the multiple threats it poses to our nation, is the sort of event that we had accumulated reserves for. \n We have saved up for a rainy day. The Covid-19 pandemic is already a mighty storm, and is still growing. \n If over the years we had frittered the reserves away, on more immediate but less existential needs, big and small, as some in this House have pressed the Government to do, we would be in a much weaker position today. \n We are experiencing a confluence of multiple external shocks - a pandemic that has triggered many nations to shut their borders, limit exports and halt economic activities, in order to fight this pandemic. \n This economic impact is magnified, as the global economy is already fragile, and further weakened by a protracted US-China trade conflict, and an oil price war. \n So this is not a normal business cycle that we would have anticipated and dealt with using the revenues collected by each term of government. It is a \"black swan\" event that comes only once every few decades. \n In view of the exceptional circumstances, the Government has sought the President's in-principle support to use past reserves to fund part of the package. \n The Covid-19 situation is fluid and fast-moving, and nobody is quite sure how it will develop. But because we have prepared ourselves well, Singapore has the resources to meet this crisis with confidence. \n We will use our resources to get through this together. \n The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely. Should it become necessary, I am prepared to propose to the President further draws on past reserves to deal with the situation. I trust that every member of this House will deeply internalise the mission to be careful stewards of our reserves. \n The measures that I have announced today will raise the overall Budget deficit for FY2020 to $39.2 billion (7.9 per cent of GDP). We are able to support this unprecedented deficit, and still remain fiscally sustainable, because we have been disciplined in the use of past reserves, tapping them only in exceptional circumstances like these. \n The situation remains highly fluid and uncertain, with significant risks. Our fiscal position will be affected from both the revenue and expenditure sides. \n With a weak GDP outlook, our revenues will be affected. Sentiment-driven revenues may come down sharply. \n While revenues are coming down, our expenditure will be going up, to enable us to respond effectively to the crisis. In the past few years, we benefited from unexpected revenue upsides, such as exceptional statutory board contributions from MAS and increased stamp duty collections. We cannot hope to rely on a repeat of this. Instead, we must be prepared to bear the down sides when they happen. Because we have been prudent and did not decide to spend all of the surplus that we collected, we are ready to meet such downsides. \n We can expect significant volatility in the economy, and in financial markets, in the near future. We will need to continue to review our expenditure plans very carefully in this fluid situation. We will adopt a nimble fiscal posture, so that we can quickly channel the resources at hand to the most urgent and important needs of our people. \n The Covid-19 pandemic is the most serious crisis we have faced in a generation. \n It has put all countries around the world to the test - on the medical, economic and social fronts. \n We have been able to respond boldly and decisively to the outbreak in Singapore, because we have forged a cohesive, resilient society. The whole nation has come together in response. Our healthcare and front-line workers are working tirelessly to care for the infected. Our cleaners are doing humble but heroic work to keep our environment clean. \n Thousands of public officers are working round the clock to respond to the threat of Covid-19. The private sector and corporations too have stepped forward. \n Individuals are doing their part - vloggers and bloggers are helping to share public messages, others are volunteering, giving support and encouragement and, crucially, by complying with health advisories and practising safe distancing. These include foreigners who live among us and who care deeply about Singapore. \n Many have also had to make sacrifices in this time. Families have had to make difficult adjustments to their lives, some having to undergo quarantine, cancel celebrations or put off other long-awaited plans, including wedding plans. \n And despite our best efforts to work with businesses and unions to save jobs, some workers have suffered a loss of income or jobs. \n The Government and the political leadership are in this with Singaporeans. We share the worries and anxieties of Singaporeans, and we will do our best for you. \n To show solidarity with Singaporeans, I announced at the Budget debate last month that the political leadership will take a one-month pay cut. With the deteriorating situation, we will go further. All political office-holders will take an additional pay cut of two months, altogether a three-month cut in their salary. \n The President, Speaker and both deputy Speakers have informed me that they will join in, and take a similar three-month pay cut in total. \n It is in times of crisis that the true character of a nation can be seen. \n The months ahead will not be easy, as the situation continues to evolve dynamically and unpredictably. We must continue to be on high vigilance, mentally and psychologically prepared for every scenario. \n The Government will lead the way. We will do our best to anticipate and respond to developments, make decisions based on facts and evidence, and exercise judgment when there are trade-offs. \n While we attend to the immediate and urgent tasks, we will set our sights on the long term, so that Singapore comes out of this crisis stronger as a nation. \n We will protect and advance the well-being and livelihoods of Singaporeans. We will take care of our people. We will leave no one behind. And we will stand with Singaporeans of all walks of life to battle this crisis, together. \n We are all in this together. And we must all look after one another in these trying times. \n This is the essence of who we are as a nation. This is the essence of who we are as a people. This is SG United. This is SG Together! \n Read Mr Heng's full speech here. \n "}, {"content": "Coronavírus: primeiro caso confirmado na Alemanha, segundo país europeu onde foi diagnosticado.

Quando os casos do novo coronavírus pareciam estar a abrandar no epicentro do surto, foram registados 14 mil novos casos nesta quinta-feira só na região de Hubei, onde fica a cidade de Wuhan. Este aumento, justificam as autoridades chinesas, pode estar relacionado com uma diferente forma de diagnóstico: como há poucos testes, os profissionais de saúde estão a contar para as estatísticas os casos diagnosticados através de tomografia computorizada aos pulmões. Ao todo são agora 60 mil casos de infecção confirmados e mais de 1360 mortes confirmadas só na China continental (254 destas mortes registadas nas últimas 24 horas, o dobro do registado no dia anterior).\nEste é o maior aumento do número de mortes desde que o vírus, agora designado “Covid-19”, foi identificado no final de Dezembro. Mesmo sem as 135 mortes registadas através desta nova forma de diagnóstico, o número de mortes em Hubei na quarta-feira foi de 107, que continua a ser o número mais alto verificado. Antes desta subida, o maior número de mortes relacionadas com este coronavírus em 24 horas foi de 103, a 10 de Fevereiro. Nesta quinta-feira, foram registados 15.152 novos casos de infecção em toda a China (mais de 13 mil com a nova forma de diagnóstico), quando no dia anterior tinham sido 2015 novos casos.\nAté agora, os casos na província de Hubei só podiam ser confirmados como sendo Covid-19 quando havia confirmação por parte dos testes de ARN (ácido ribonucleico), que tem informação genética em que se pode identificar organismos como os vírus. Recorrendo-se a radiografias torácicas e a tomografias computadorizadas para detectar novos casos, os pacientes com sintomas poderão receber tratamento mais rapidamente e aumentar as suas probabilidades de recuperar, adiantou a Comissão de Saúde de Hubei. Esta nova forma de diagnóstico está a ser aplicada somente na região de Hubei.\nDepois da subida vertiginosa do número de infectados, o Partido Comunista chinês substituiu detentores de cargos de topo no epicentro da epidemia por homens de confiança do Presidente. Esta “purga” é justificada pela actuação pouco célere e ineficaz das autoridades locais para conter a propagação do vírus.\nA subida a pique revela a dificuldade em perceber a verdadeira dimensão do surto na China, sobretudo no epicentro da crise de saúde, onde há milhares de pessoas doentes que ainda não foram testados, como faz notar o jornal The New York Times.

No Japão, foi registada a primeira morte nesta quinta-feira. Em Portugal, houve casos suspeitos mas nenhum confirmado; os 20 cidadãos que foram repatriados de Wuhan (18 portugueses e duas brasileiras) não apresentam sintomas e deverão sair da quarentena voluntária este sábado. \nPara acompanhar a situação, a Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS) enviou especialistas para a China e refere que uma primeira vacina poderá estar pronta em 18 meses. Por cá, os ministros da Saúde da União Europeia reunir-se-ão nesta quinta-feira em Bruxelas para discutir a evolução da nova estirpe de coronavírus. As 20 pessoas que chegaram a Portugal a 2 de Fevereiro vindas de Wuhan e que estão de quarentena voluntária sairão do hospital no sábado.

He will be treated in isolation, it added.\n“People in close contact with the patient will be kept in home isolation and be asked about their state of health every day,” it said. “As soon as a contact person develops symptoms, they will also be isolated in hospital.”\nIn North Rhine-Westphalia, the state health ministry said the man there was admitted to hospital on Monday afternoon with symptoms of severe pneumonia.\n“The patient is in a critical condition and is currently being isolated in the intensive care unit,” the ministry said.\n“The patient’s wife is also being treated as an in-patient with symptoms of a viral disease. Her condition is currently stable. The diagnosis on whether she has also been infected with the virus is still pending,” it added in a statement.\nSchools and kindergartens in the Heinsberg district of North Rhine-Westphalia, where the man is from, will remain closed on Wednesday as a precaution, the ministry said.\nThe new confirmed cases take to 18 the total number of coronavirus cases in Germany. There have been no deaths.\nCar supplier Webasto said last month a Chinese employee had tested positive for the virus upon returning to China following a visit to the company headquarters near Munich.

Das Ergebnis der Tests\nsoll am Montagmittag vorliegen.\nBereits vor einer Woche waren etwa 100 deutsche Staatsbürgerinnen und Staatsbürger und deren Familienangehörige mit einer Maschine der Bundeswehr nach Frankfurt am Main geflogen. Zwei von ihnen wurden positiv auf das Virus getestet.\nDie Zahl der Todesopfer durch das neue Coronavirus hat derweil die der Sars-Pandemie vor 17 Jahren überstiegen. Chinas Gesundheitsbehörde meldete am Sonntagmorgen 89 neue Todesfälle. Weltweit sind damit bisher 811 Menschen durch die Lungenerkrankung getötet worden. Durch die Atemwegserkrankung Sars waren 2002/2003 weltweit 774 Patienten gestorben.\nDie Fluggesellschaft Air China kündigte in der Nacht zum Sonntag an, ihre Verbindungen zwischen China und den USA wegen der Coronavirus-Epidemie \"anzupassen\". Der Webseite der Gesellschaft ist zu entnehmen, dass zahlreiche Flüge zwischen Peking und Washington sowie in andere US-amerikanische Städte bis zum 28. März gestrichen wurden. Einige der Verbindungen zwischen Peking und Los Angeles sowie San Francisco und New York werden der Airline zufolge jedoch weiter bedient.\nDie Zahl der nachgewiesenen Infektionen stieg in China zuletzt auf circa 37.200. Außerhalb der Volksrepublik gibt es in mehr als zwei Dutzend Ländern mehr als 270 weitere Fälle, davon 14 Erkrankungen in Deutschland.\nChina plant für den Kampf gegen die Epidemie\numgerechnet fast zehn Milliarden Euro ein. Mit dem Geld solle unter anderem sichergestellt werden,\ndass sich alle Chinesen einen Virustest und eine Behandlung\nleisten können, teilte das Finanzministerium mit. Auch solle verhindert werden, dass finanzielle\nEngpässe den Einsatz zur Eindämmung von Corona in den einzelnen\nRegionen behinderten.\nDie wachsende Zahl an Infektionen und Todesfällen durch das\nneue Virus ängstigt viele Chinesen, die am Montag\nnach den verlängerten Neujahrsferien an ihren Arbeitsplatz\nzurückkehren. In den sozialen Medien wurden Unmut gegenüber den\nBehörden und Zweifel an den offiziellen Fallzahlen laut. Die\nFerien waren verlängert worden, um die Ausbreitung des Virus einzudämmen.\nIn Spanien ist unterdessen eine zweite Infektion mit dem\nCoronavirus bestätigt worden. Auf Mallorca sei eine Person\npositiv auf den Erreger getestet worden, teilte das Nationale\nMikrobiologiezentrum mit. Tests bei drei weiteren Personen seien\nnegativ ausgefallen. Die vier seien mit jemandem in Frankreich\nin Kontakt gewesen, bei dem die Erkrankung anschließend\ndiagnostiziert worden sei. Zuvor waren in Frankreich fünf neuer Fälle gemeldet worden. Die französische Gesundheitsministerin Agnès Buzyn teilte mit, ein Kind und vier Erwachsene mit britischer Staatsbürgerschaft seien in Frankreich positiv auf das Virus getestet worden. Zwölf Fälle in Deutschland gehen auf eine chinesische Mitarbeiterin des bayerischen Autozulieferers Webasto zurück. Auch wurden zwei aus China ausgeflogene Rückkehrer positiv getestet. Zudem gibt es nach Angaben (Stand von Freitagabend) der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) Fälle in Italien, Großbritannien, Russland, Belgien, Finnland und Schweden. In Europa gibt es damit mindestens 37 Infizierte.\nEnde 2019 meldeten die chinesischen Behörden der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO eine Häufung von Lungenentzündungen unklarer Ursache in der zentralchinesischen Stadt Wuhan. Bereits eine Woche später identifizierten chinesische Forscher ein neuartiges Virus als Ursache der Krankheitsfälle. Es gehört zur Gruppe der Coronaviren. Wenige Tage darauf veröffentlichte eine Gruppe um den Virologen Christian Drosten von der Berliner Charité den ersten diagnostischen Test für das neue Virus, das Forscher provisorisch 2019-nCoV nennen. Mit dem Test kann das Virus im Labor nachgewiesen werden. Als Quelle des Erregers vermuten die chinesischen Behörden einen Lebensmittelmarkt in Wuhan, auf dem neben Fisch und Meeresfrüchten auch exotische Tiere wie Schlangen verkauft wurden. Der Markt wurde geschlossen und desinfiziert.\nSowohl die Atemwegserkrankungen Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) als auch Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) werden von Coronaviren verursacht, die ihren Ursprung in Tieren haben. Während der Sars-Pandemie infizierten sich in den Jahren 2002 und 2003 etwa 8.000 Menschen, mehr als 750 starben. Mit dem Mers-Virus haben sich seit seiner Entdeckung 2012 bis zum Jahresende 2019 etwa 2.500 Menschen angesteckt, jeder Dritte ist daran gestorben. Insgesamt gibt es aber mehrere Hundert Arten von Coronaviren. Viele von ihnen betreffen die Atemwege und können zum Beispiel Erkältungen verursachen.\nIn China sind inzwischen mehrere Tausend Personen erkrankt, einige von ihnen – die meisten wohl mit Vorerkrankungen – sind an einer Lungenentzündung infolge des Virus gestorben. Die ersten Infektionsfälle außerhalb Chinas wurden in Thailand, Japan und Südkorea bekannt. Es handelt sich um Reisende, die vorher in Wuhan gewesen waren. Am 21. Januar meldeten US-Behörden die erste Infektion bei einem Touristen, der aus Wuhan zurückkam, am 24. Januar wurden die ersten Fälle in Frankreich bekannt. Mittlerweile wurden auch erste Fälle in Deutschland bestätigt. Typische Zeichen einer Infektion sind Fieber, Husten und Atembeschwerden. Das Virus kann eine Lungenentzündung verursachen, die tödlich enden kann. Da es sich um eine virale Krankheit handelt, helfen Antibiotika nicht.\nInzwischen ist klar, dass das Virus von Mensch zu Mensch übertragen werden kann. Chinesische Behörden haben mehrere solcher Übertragungen bestätigt, nachdem auch etwa ein Dutzend Fälle bei medizinischem Personal bekannt wurden. Medizinerinnen und Mediziner gehen davon aus, dass das Virus vor allem über Tröpfcheninfektion übertragen wird. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation rechnet, wie sie am 24. Januar mitteilte, momentan damit, dass ein Infizierter im Schnitt 1,4 bis 2,5 andere Menschen ansteckt. Bewahrheiten sich diese Zahlen, ist das Virus weniger ansteckend als Sars und auch die Virusgrippe. Die WHO empfiehlt generelle Hygieneregeln zu beachten: Man solle sich häufig die Hände waschen und engen Kontakt zu Personen mit Atemwegserkrankungen und wilden Tieren meiden.\nDas lässt sich noch nicht mit Sicherheit sagen. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation teilte am 28. Januar mit, dass ungefähr ein Fünftel der gemeldeten Fälle durch das Virus schwer krank werde, im Zweifelsfall also intensivmedizinisch behandelt werden muss. Berichten zufolge handelte es sich bei den ersten Todesopfern um Patienten, die teils schwere Vorerkrankungen hatten. Auch bei anderen Infektionskrankheiten sind Menschen mit Vorerkrankungen besonders gefährdet – etwa bei der Grippe. Coronaviren sind dafür bekannt, dass sie mutieren, also ihr Erbgut verändern können. Das kann dazu führen, dass sie im Laufe eines Ausbruchs gefährlicher für Menschen werden – aber auch zum genauen Gegenteil. Das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) erwartet zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt keine ähnlich hohe Mortalität wie beim Ausbruch von Sars.\nDie WHO geht nach eigenen Angaben gegen die Verbreitung von Falschinformationen bezüglich des neuen Virus vor. Sie sorgten für Verwirrung und Angst in der Bevölkerung, sagte WHO-Generaldirektor Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"Wir bekämpfen daher auch die Trolle und Verschwörungstheoretiker, die falsche Informationen verbreiten und damit die Arbeit gegen den Ausbruch unterlaufen\", sagte Tedros. Man sei dafür mit zahlreichen sozialen Netzwerken in Kontakt. \"Wir haben sie gebeten, falsche Informationen herauszufiltern und korrekte Infos von vertrauenswürdigen Quellen zu begünstigen.\" Über Instagram und YouTube habe die WHO zudem den Kontakt zu Influencern und Influencerinnen gesucht und darum gebeten, sachliche Nachrichten über das Virus zu verbreiten. Dabei liege der Fokus laut Tedros auf der Region Asien-Pazifik.\nLaut einer Studie chinesischer Wissenschaftler und Wissenschaftlerinnen könnte das neuartige Virus auch über Fäkalien übertragbar sein. Einige Patienten in einem Krankenhaus in Wuhan hätten vor dem Auftreten von Fiebersymptomen und Atembeschwerden zuerst unter Durchfall und Übelkeit gelitten, heißt es in einer im Journal of the American Medical Association veröffentlichten Arbeit.\nDer Krankheitsverlauf habe bei zehn Prozent von 138 Erkrankten mit Durchfall und Übelkeit begonnen, schreiben die Wissenschaftler. Sie gaben an, sich bei den frühen Fällen der erstmals im Dezember in Wuhan aufgetretenen Krankheit vor allen auf Atemwegssymptome konzentriert zu haben. Dabei könnten mit dem Verdauungstrakt verbundene Symptome übersehen worden sein.\nAuch das Sars-Virus, das genauso wie die neuartige Erkrankung durch Coronaviren ausgelöst wird, hatte sich während der Epidemie Anfang der Nullerjahre teilweise so übertragen. David Fisman, Epidemiologe an der Universität Toronto warnte, die Ansteckung über Fäkalien könne vor allem in Krankenhäusern eine neue Herausforderung für die Eindämmung der Viruserkrankung darstellen. Als Hauptübertragungsweg des Virus gilt weiterhin eine Tröpfcheninfektion über den Husten eines Erkrankten.\n"}, {"content": "China heads into Lunar New Year on shutdown as virus spreads to Europe.

Health officials have warned that the Wuhan outbreak has reached a \"critical stage\", as the virus mutates and the outbreak continues to spread to more provinces, territories and countries. \n The United States and Macau registered their first cases yesterday, while infected people have been identified for the first time in Hainan, Fujian, Liaoning and Anhui, widening the number of affected provinces to more than 20. \n Hong Kong reported that a man had preliminarily tested positive for the virus, but a final test result would be known only today. \n The authorities fear the number of cases will soar as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel across or out of the country during the Chinese New Year holidays. \n The death toll climbed to 17 and, as of last night, at least 540 people have tested positive for the 2019-nCoV virus, which scientists have determined is part of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) family. \n The National Health Commission's emergency management office director Xu Shuqiang said the country is at a critical stage in its battle to stop the viral outbreak from turning into a pandemic. \n The virus is believed to have originated from wild animals sold illegally at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei province, where the first wave of patients had worked at, said virologist Gao Fu. \n \"From animal to human, the virus has adapted and evolved. The relationship between viruses and humans is like a cat and mouse game,\" said Professor Gao, who is director-general of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. \n While experts said the biggest worry is the emergence of super-spreaders, Prof Gao said there is no evidence of these highly infectious individuals yet, even though 14 healthcare workers were infected by one single carrier in Wuhan. \n The World Health Organisation identifies a super-spreader as someone who infects more than 10 secondary contacts. \n \"We will be monitoring closely because there is the possibility of super-spreaders,\" said Prof Gao. \n Wuhan Mayor Zhang Xianwang said the 14 healthcare workers - a doctor and 13 nurses - were infected by a patient in a neurosurgery ward who had not been tested for the new coronavirus. He developed a fever only after his surgery. \n \"That was a very profound lesson,\" said Mr Zhang, who has appealed to people not to travel in or out of the city. \n More than 90 per cent of the infection cases have been in Wuhan. The central Chinese city of 11 million has been on high alert as the authorities step up checks on travellers and vehicles. \n All trading of wildlife has been banned, and restaurants have been prohibited from serving dishes with the animals. \n News that the disease is now being spread through human contact sent jitters across cities, as people rushed out to buy face masks and disinfectants. Phar-macies in Beijing and Shanghai ran low on stocks, especially after the country launched a nationwide hygiene campaign. \n Beijing-based insurance agent Kevin Tu, 40, was bent on going home to Wuhan today to spend the new year with his parents. But he sought a refund for his air ticket yesterday after his parents insisted that he stay put in the capital city. \n \"They were worried about my safety, but I am worried about theirs too. I have told them to stay home as much as possible, and to avoid crowded places,\" Mr Tu, an only child, told The Straits Times. \n On Monday, the health commission upgraded the Wuhan pneumonia to a Class B infectious disease, which puts it in the same category as Sars. But it is handling the outbreak with stricter measures under a Class A category, which stipulates that an infection anywhere in the country must be reported within two hours. \n The Class A classification also allows for greater resources to be mobilised. \n Ms Jiao Yahui, a health commission official, said while there are hospitals currently designated for treating the pneumonia patients, the authorities' contingency plans include backup hospitals in case the epidemic becomes widespread. \n Front-line medical workers including Chinese traditional medi-cine practitioners in Beijing told ST that they have been made to cancel their Chinese New Year leave to be on standby since Tuesday. \n Hospitals in the capital city have set up pre-screening triages, and suspected cases are transferred to fever clinics. \"We just hope this battle will pass soon,\" said Chinese traditional medicine physician Jia Xiaoming, 30. \n "}, {"content": "Sale of masks soars in Delhi as city alarmed over coronavirus threat. Amid the coronavirus alarm, the sale of N95 face masks has soared in Delhi, triggering a massive shortage of the protective gear and a rise in its price in many areas.\nThe masks have vanished from the medical stores in some places including those around RML Hospital where the number of patients under observation rose to six on Monday. Another eight patients have tested negative and they have been discharged.\nWhere masks are still available, in Connaught Place, for instance, long queues formed at the stores. Customers were also seen snapping up hand sanitisers and thermometers.\nShops that have run out of N95 masks have no idea as to when their next delivery would arrive. Vendors of medical supplies said that masks were becoming harder to source. Uttam, a medical store owner near RML Hospital, confirmed that there has been a surge in the demand for masks after coronavirus cases were reported in India. \"We have sold around 10,000 masks in a week. These include both N95 and surgical masks. N95s are out of stock at the moment,\" he said.\nPawan, another medical store owner near RML Hospital, admitted that the increase in demand has spiked prices. \"A plain mask which used to cost Rs 5 is now being sold at Rs 10. Also, we used to buy one N95 for Rs 100. Now we're not getting it even for Rs 150,\" he said.\nMedical supply vendors said people who cannot get N95 masks are buying regular ones. However, according to Dr Sandeep Nayar, HOD, Respiratory Medicine, BLK Super Speciality Hospital, regular masks do not protect people from the Chinese virus.\n\"Only special masks like N95 or N99 can prevent coronavirus infection. These too should be tightly worn. Mouth and nose should be properly covered,\" he said.\nLast week, India banned exports of all kinds of personal protection equipment, including masks. The move aims at meeting the rising demand for such products.\nTHE EXPORT BAN \nOn Friday, the All India Food and Drug Licence Association (AFDLH) had sought a ban on the export of surgical and N95 masks as they were not available in local markets.\n\"Manufacturers are getting huge orders for these masks which are being sold for 10-times more than their actual price. Due to this, Indian citizens will find it difficult to get these masks when needed. Hence the export and the price of these masks should be controlled,\" AFDLH had written to the government.\n\"Given the high and lucrative demand internationally, manufacturers are ignoring the need in local markets and were busy in meeting the export demands. These trade activities had put Indians at the risk of not getting the masks to be safe from this virus. So, we demanded the government to ban its export and regulate the prices,\" said Abhay Pande, president, AFDLH.\nThe N95 respirator is designed to fit very closely to the face and, as a result, more efficiently filters airborne particles. The N95 face mask is available online but delivery can take up to two weeks, making it a less feasible option for customers.\nAt a high-level meeting on Monday, Health Ministry officials said that adequate materials like personal protection equipment (PPE) and N95 masks are available and the Centre is closely monitoring the situation in all states and Union Territories. coronavirus causes a flu-like severe respiratory ailment and can spread from person to person by airborne droplets that an infected person expels when sneezing or coughing.\n\"One must avoid direct contact with those suspected to have been infected by coronavirus. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose if you have not washed your hands properly. Cover your face while coughing or sneezing with a tissue,\" Nayar said.\nCENTRAL GOVT SWINGS INTO ACTION \nMeanwhile, a Group of Ministers (GoM) was formed on the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It held a meeting to review the preparedness to contain the spread of the virus in the country. The GoM includes Union ministers Harsh Vardhan, Hardeep Singh Puri, S Jaishankar, G Kishan Reddy, Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Mansukh Lal Mandaviya.\nThe ministers were apprised of the three confirmed cases reported from Kerala and the preventive steps and measures taken to contain coronavirus.\nThe GoM also took note of the government announcing a temporary suspension of the e-visa facility for Chinese travellers and foreigners residing in the neighbouring country and a fresh advisory saying anyone with travel history to China since January 15 can be quarantined.\nThe government has also advised that people having compelling reasons to visit India should contact the Indian embassy in Beijing or consulate in Shanghai or Guangzhou.\nSo far 645 people have been transported to India from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. They have been admitted to quarantine centres of the Army and the ITBP in and around the National Capital.\nTests conducted for coronavirus on 406 people, who were evacuated to Delhi from China's Wuhan city to an ITBP facility in Chhawla area, have been negative till now, a senior official of the border guarding force said. The Kerala government has declared the coronavirus epidemic as a state calamity with a third student testing positive for the infection in the state. The decision was taken at the apex committee of the State Disaster Management Authority chaired by Chief Secretary Tom Jose. Two earlier positive cases, also of students who came back from Wuhan, were reported from Thrissur and Alapuzha districts.\nMeanwhile, the death toll in China soared to 425 with 64 deaths on Monday while the number of confirmed cases climbed to 20,400, Chinese health officials announced on Monday.\n"}, {"content": "it’s ‘battle against nature’ for covid-19 and more time is needed to learn about disease: moh official. SINGAPORE — The Covid-19 disease appears to be “containable” based on the measures that some countries, including Singapore, have taken to combat the coronavirus outbreak, even though much is still unknown about it, said the director of communicable diseases at the Ministry of Health (MOH). \n “China, Hong Kong, Singapore have (put in place) quite a few different measures and different styles of containment, and they seem to be reducing the number of new cases. \n “So perhaps it is not quite as transmissible as influenza,” Dr Vernon Lee said on Tuesday (Feb 25) at a panel discussing how Singapore has responded to the Covid-19 outbreak so far.   \n However, he stressed repeatedly that more time is needed to understand the transmission and the severity characteristics of Covid-19.  \n “Time will tell. I think we still need to learn more about this disease.” \n Dr Lee, who is also an adjunct associate professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, was one of four panellists at the discussion organised by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) and streamed live on its Facebook page. \n The others were economist Barnabas Gan from the United Overseas Bank (UOB); Dr Carol Soon, senior research fellow at IPS; and Dr Shashi Jayakumar, senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS). \n They delved into how Singapore has dealt with the medical, economic, and social impact of the public health emergency. \n Dr Lee was asked by Dr Gillian Koh, moderator and deputy director of research at IPS, to give his take on how medical science and epidemiologists around the world are dealing with the new coronavirus, which had its first outbreak in Wuhan of China’s Hubei province in December last year. \n In response, he said it is unprecedented the way in which the amount of information known about Covid-19 has ballooned in the past two months, but there are still several unknowns.  \n “It is a battle against nature, and with time, some of these answers will be clearer.” \n When it came to establishing the mortality rate of the disease, for example, it is challenging to detect milder cases of Covid-19, which may also skew the statistics on case fatality rates by several magnitudes, he said. \n In Singapore, more than 10 per cent of Covid-19 cases have been admitted to the intensive care unit, which “is certainly concerning”, Dr Lee said. \n “Because of the sheer number of people that are affected across the globe, (Covid-19) still caused many deaths. So we do not want to trivialise any virus because it has some potential impact.” \n  From left: Dr Gillian Koh, Dr Vernon Lee, Mr Barnabas Gan, Dr Carol Soon and Dr Shashi Jayakumar at a panel discussion organised by the Institute of Policy Studies. Photo: Institute of Policy Studies, National University of Singapore   \n TOURISM LOSS COULD WIPE OUT 2020 ECONOMIC GAINS \n Since the time needed to fully learn about Covid-19 may be protracted, the economic impact of this disease can be significant, considering that Singapore’s economy was affected only across a single quarter during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) pandemic in 2003, Mr Gan said. \n Before the outbreak arrived in Singapore, UOB predicted that Singapore’s economy would grow by 1.5 per cent this year. \n However, current economic figures now point to a 25 to 30 per cent fall in tourism arrivals, which could work out to a S$6.8 billion to S$8.1 billion fall in tourism receipts this year due to the viral outbreak, he said. This is equivalent to the 1.5 per cent growth that UOB predicted earlier for 2020. \n “That will completely wipe out our GDP (gross domestic product) and bring it to around 0.5 per cent, just based on how much our tourism receipts actually fall,” he said.  \n Dr Koh noted that the fall could be greater, given the impact on other non-tourism sectors such as aviation, manufacturing, retail, and food-and-beverage. She asked Mr Gan whether the measures announced during Budget 2020 were enough to bolster Singapore through this period. \n In his Budget speech last week, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat had announced that the Government will set aside a total of S$6.4 billion to help workers, firms, households and frontline agencies tackle Covid-19. \n Mr Gan said some people have noted that a few measures came with a short time span, such as the three-month period for the Jobs Support Scheme to help companies retain workers, but the Government has around S$8 billion more up its sleeve in accumulated surpluses during the current term of government. This kitty could be used to “push up” the economy if needed, he said. \n SINGAPOREANS HAVE TO FACE A ‘SLOW-BURN’ CRISIS \n On how the people here have reacted, Dr Soon and Dr Jayakumar said that Singaporeans need to be able to prepare emotionally for health pandemics, which Dr Jayakumar described as a “slow-burn” crisis. \n Dr Soon noted that three types of misinformation emerged during this outbreak. These are factual misinformation, such as the false rumours of MRT station closures; misleading advisories such as unproven home remedies being shared online; and xenophobic, racist sentiments that have no basis in fact, which are observed both overseas and in Singapore. \n She said that Singapore has been effective in trying to plug information gaps about the virus through “a very interesting and relatively efficacious playbook”.  \n Besides daily updates about the spread of the virus, the Government reinforces key messages through different channels, such as through various government ministries, the media, and experts to help people dissect the situation. \n It has also wielded the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) to counter Covid-19 falsehoods in a way that most people agree with, she said. \n Government spokespersons were also quick to counter rumours, she added, noting how Health Minister Gan Kim Yong had come out at one point to categorically refute talk that the authorities were going to raise the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition from Orange level to Red. \n Still, more can be done, she said. While the Government has been providing updates usually at a certain time each day, on some days, the information may arrive later in the evening. This may create suspicions, Dr Soon said. \n “Where there is an information gap, people will rely on heuristics — mental shortcuts — to plug the gaps,” she added.  \n Dr Jayakumar said that while Singapore is prepared for one-off incidents such as terrorist attacks, the Government, academics and think-tanks should do more to look at how the country can bounce back from slow-burn crises such as pandemics and climate change. \n “In my point of view, it is almost problematic that Singapore is so safe, clean and secure. It is not normal... it is supernormal, because almost nothing of note, security-wise, seems to happen in Singapore.  \n “Now we have to accept that these things may be there for a long time,” Dr Jayakumar said. \n "}, {"content": "Rush is real: How world leaders are trying to fight corona-triggered recession fears.

Seguir as regras da Direcção-Geral de Saúde, da Organização Mundial de Saúde e do Centro Europeu de Prevenção e Controlo de Doenças – é nisso que os grandes grupos empresariais portugueses e multinacionais a operar em Portugal têm presente nos últimos dias para enfrentar o novo coronavírus. O que se concentra sobretudo em restringir viagens profissionais, usar a teleconferência e redes sociais para a actividade diária e solicitar aos trabalhadores que fiquem em casa sempre que tenham estado fora do país durante as últimas duas semanas.\nSão as multinacionais com sede ou presença em Portugal que, devido à sua dimensão, têm já medidas mais concretas em campo, segundo as respostas recolhidas por escrito pelo PÚBLICO de 14 empresas e duas organizações sectoriais.\nNa suíça Nestlé, o maior grupo alimentar do mundo com duas fábricas no país, foi solicitado “a todos os colaboradores que não realizem viagens internacionais em trabalho, nas próximas três semanas, em concreto no período entre 25 de Fevereiro e 15 de Março”.\nNa maior companhia de distribuição portuguesa, a Jerónimo Martins, que recorda que nos três mercados em que opera (Portugal, Polónia e Colômbia) “não há, até ao momento, nenhum caso de coronavírus confirmado”, as restrições estão, para já, localizadas geograficamente, com destaque para a zona onde surgiram os primeiros casos. “Logo desde o início da crise do coronavírus que, no grupo Jerónimo Martins, as viagens profissionais à Ásia foram proibidas, tendo-se desaconselhado também as viagens a título pessoal”.\nA EDP, cujo maior accionista é a China Three Gorges, “aconselha os colaboradores a evitar as viagens à China, e a países/zonas onde se verifiquem comunidades de transmissão activa do Covid-19”.\nNo caso da petrolífera Galp, “todas as viagens previstas para as áreas actualmente afectadas estão suspensas”, além de a sua realização estar “restringida aos casos de estrita necessidade”, reconhecendo a companhia liderada por Carlos Gomes da Silva que “vai continuar a monitorizar a evolução da situação e a avaliar eventuais ajustamentos das medidas adoptadas”.\nPela mesma medida, a multinacional Vodafone avança que “todas [as viagens profissionais] que não forem urgentes serão adiadas”. A operadora de telecomunicações “recomenda, ainda, que sejam evitadas viagens para destinos de risco” no caso de viagens pessoais dos seus trabalhadores. Garante que “está a acompanhar a evolução da situação” e que, se houver agravamento, “serão tomadas medidas de protecção adicionais, que podem incluir a suspensão total de todas as viagens profissionais”.\nIgualmente drástica é a opção da fabricante de bebidas Sumol+Compal: “a S+C proibiu as viagens profissionais para todos os países considerados de risco e restringiu ao estritamente necessário todas as restantes viagens profissionais”, afirma fonte oficial. “A proibição afecta todos os seus colaboradores” e “a situação é analisada e revista todas as semanas”.\n“De forma a mitigar o risco de contágio, as viagens ao estrangeiro e as viagens com recurso a transporte aéreo estão condicionadas”, responde, por seu turno o Millennium BCP, que adianta que “está a acompanhar de perto a situação em todas as geografias onde tem operações e a observar escrupulosamente todas as recomendações emitidas pelas autoridades competentes, no caso de Portugal as orientações da DGS”.\nO Super Bock Group, que nos últimos anos incluiu a China na lista dos seus principiais mercados exportadores, desaconselha não só “deslocações para destinos com restrições impostas por entidades oficiais, bem como reuniões “físicas” e contacto próximo com pessoas oriundas” das zonas identificadas na Itália, Japão, Singapura, Coreia do Sul e Japão.\nNa operadora de telecomunicações Altice, foi decidido o “adiamento de viagens aéreas não essenciais, em particular para o continente asiático” estando as “viagens aéreas para países com casos identificados” todas sujeitas a análise risco/benefício”.\n“No início de Fevereiro de 2020”, sublinha fonte oficial do grupo de telecomunicações com presença em vários mercados, “foi efectuada uma comunicação às equipas de gestão da Altice Portugal com informações e orientações preventivas, a serem propagadas por toda a organização”. E, “desde então, foi elaborado um plano de contingência que está em constante actualização”.\nTambém no início deste mês, o Super Bock Group criou “uma comissão interna com acompanhamento médico para monitorizar esta situação”. “Inserido no apoio de Medicina no Trabalho do grupo”, esclarece fonte oficial da cervejeira, “foi designado um contacto médico específico para o qual deverão os colaboradores canalizar quaisquer questões ou informações, através do email ou telefone”.\nTambém a CGD “tem um Plano de Contingência onde estão previstas as acções a tomar em caso de pandemia”, mas o banco público não pormenoriza, frisando contudo que “a Caixa Geral de Depósitos acompanha as posições que são tomadas pela Direcção Geral de Saúde”.\nOs CTT “estão a reforçar o Plano de Contingência para eventuais situações de crise, de modo a garantir a continuidade e o nível de serviço da sua actividade”, tendo realizado já “várias comunicações a todos os colaboradores, com as recomendações da Direcção Geral da Saúde (DGS)”. Está “a implementar na empresa essas mesmas recomendações”.\nO grupo segurador Fidelidade, detido em 85% pelo conglomerado chinês Fosun e em 15% pela CGD, garante que “elaborou um Plano de Contingência de resposta ao surto viral Covid-19 e que vem complementar o Plano de Continuidade de Negócio que a companhia tem preparado de forma permanente para responder a qualquer cenário adverso, em que um cenário de um surto viral está também incluído”.\nA REN – que sublinha que “tem como prioridade a segurança de todos os colaboradores e a salvaguarda da gestão das operações críticas da sua responsabilidade, como a gestão dos sistemas nacionais de transporte de electricidade e gás natural” – afirma que está “a acompanhar a evolução da situação desde o início em coordenação com as entidades oficiais”, seguindo as recomendações da DGS. “Todos os colaboradores estão sensibilizados para a importância da adopção de medidas de prevenção tendo acesso a canais internos e externos para esclarecimento de duvidas e obtenção de informação adicional”.\nNa operadora Nos, tem sido feito o acompanhamento diário, “em total alinhamento com a DGS e a OMS”, da evolução “do vírus 2019-nCoV”. “Existem, naturalmente”, acrescenta fonte oficial, “uma série de medidas preventivas já acauteladas”, que, todavia não pormenoriza.\nNo caso da FIPA – Federação das Indústrias Portuguesas Agro-Alimentares, explica Pedro Queiroz, director-geral da organização: “não temos nenhuma viagem prevista para os países mais afectados”. “Neste momento, a Federação está a desenvolver todo o seu trabalho dentro da normalidade e sem o cancelamento de qualquer compromisso nacional ou internacional”.\nAlém das medidas preventivas de evitar que os seus colaboradores viajem até destinos mais ou menos expostos ao novo coronavírus, a maior parte das empresas optou por pedir aos funcionários que, tendo viajado – sobretudo por causa da “ponte” que o dia de Carnaval, a 25 de Fevereiro, permitia – optassem pelo mais simples. Ficar em casa e recorrer ao teletrabalho.\nNo caso da Vodafone, “os colaboradores devem informar proactivamente a sua chefia directa das viagens pessoais para o estrangeiro que tenham realizado recentemente ou que estejam planeadas, identificando eventuais escalas” em países por onde tenham passado. O “alargamento do regime de trabalho em mobilidade, o qual já é prática comum na Vodafone” pode, “numa situação de emergência” passar “a abranger um maior número de colaboradores, durante mais tempo”.\n“Conscientes de que estamos a regressar de um período de férias, como medida de controlo e prevenção, as pessoas da Galp que possam regressar de áreas afectadas ficam a trabalhar em casa em regime de home office, seguindo as boas práticas aplicáveis, e sendo disponibilizado o acesso à realização de exames médicos”, explica fonte oficial da petrolífera.\nNa Sumol+Compal, “os colaboradores que viajem, em férias, para destinos de risco, têm que informar os Recursos Humanos e cumprir o previsto no Plano de Contingência”, sendo a situação “analisada e revista todas as semanas”.\nNa antiga Unicer, “qualquer colaborador, familiar ou pessoa próxima do mesmo, que tenha viajado nos últimos dias” para a China, Itália, Japão, Singapura, Coreia do Sul e Irão “tome medidas específicas no sentido de contactarem o nosso médico indicado, por forma a poder ser realizada a devida monitorização do estado clínico e despiste de qualquer possível incubação”. Caso tenham viajado para outros destinos, “nomeadamente com passagem por aeroportos, a recomendação adicional é que os trabalhadores “se certifiquem que todos os elementos do grupo de sua proximidade se encontram de boa saúde e sem qualquer sintoma que possa ser associado a esta doença”.\nSolução semelhante está a ser aplicada no grupo JM. “Uma vez que Itália é agora considerado um país foco”, os colaboradores que regressam deste ou de qualquer país considerado de foco, devem ficar a trabalhar de casa até terminar o período considerado necessário para garantir que a pessoa não está infectada”. “Tomaremos as medidas adicionais necessárias, de acordo com o evoluir da situação”, acrescenta fonte oficial da dona do Pingo Doce.\n“As situações em que se verifique a integração de pessoas com regresso de uma viagem à China, ou de países que constam da listagem emitida pelo ECDC [Centro Europeu de Prevenção e Controlo de Doenças], devem ser enquadradas em regime de trabalho à distância durante um período de duas semanas, sendo que o regresso às instalações da EDP, só deve ocorrer caso não se manifestem, durante esse período, sintomas de tosse, febre ou de dificuldades respiratórias”.\nA Altice irá também proceder à “vigilância e apoio aos colaboradores que regressem de zonas infectadas” e recorrer “ao regime de teletrabalho”.\nNo BCP, sempre possível e “como já é prática no banco”, assegura fonte oficial, “privilegiam-se as reuniões por videoconferência” num contexto de restrição de viagens aéreas.\n“Métodos alternativos de comunicação, como Skype ou pelo sistema de comunicação por telepresença”, que existem em todos os mercados em que está presente, é o que escolhe a Nestlé em substituição de “viagens profissionais domésticas” e recomenda “a todos os colaboradores”. “Por outro lado”, adiciona fonte oficial da Nestlé Portugal, o facto de ser hoje uma empresa “que tem implementadas práticas de trabalho mais ágil e flexível” permite aos seus colaboradores “trabalhar de qualquer local, inclusive de suas casas caso o entendam necessário”.\nA companhia alimentar suíça não acusa contudo qualquer impacto na actividade com o surto do novo coronavírus, localmente. “No caso da Nestlé Portugal, não verificamos por enquanto qualquer constrangimento ao nível da nossa ‘supply chain’ [cadeia de abastecimento], nem ao nível das nossas exportações”.\nA fabricante de bebidas Sumol+Compal garante que “não é possível, neste momento aferir ou correlacionar qualquer variação da actividade com o surto do coronavírus”.\nGlobalmente, o Super Bock Group não avança para já impactos. “Estamos, sobretudo, a fazer o acompanhamento da situação pela dimensão global que está a ter”. No caso específico do mercado chinês, diz fonte oficial, “é prematuro avaliar impactos na operação, considerando que as exportações para a China, nos meses de Janeiro e Fevereiro, são, por norma, mais brandas por ser uma altura do ano com temperaturas mais baixas e também porque houve encomendas relevantes em Novembro e Dezembro para salvaguardar as festividades como o Ano Novo Chinês”, este ano celebrado a 25 de Janeiro.\nA FIPA, a federação a que os três grupos pertencem, acredita “que a maioria das empresas [do sector agro-alimentar e das bebidas] está a operar dentro da normalidade”. Pedro Queiroz reconhece que “ainda é prematuro fazer qualquer avaliação deste tipo”, e recorda que “embora seja um mercado de grande atractividade, a China representa ainda pouco mais de 1% dos clientes e fornecedores da fileira agro-alimentar”. Conclusão? “Não se consegue apurar um impacto significativo no sector”.\nDa distribuição vem resposta semelhante: “a Associação Portuguesa de Empresas de Distribuição (APED) não registou, até ao momento, quaisquer alterações ao normal funcionamento dos espaços comerciais dos seus associados”. “Quer o consumo, quer o abastecimento estão a decorrer com total normalidade”, garante a associação que reúne híper e supermercados e marcas com Ikea e Fnac.\nA JM, especificamente, diz que não regista “qualquer impacto”: “relativamente à China, não temos exposição a importações alimentares e no que diz respeito a produtos não-alimentares as importações também são muito reduzidas”.\nA EDP, presente em várias geografias, diz que “até ao momento não foi registado nenhum impacto no normal funcionamento das várias empresas do grupo”.\nNo turismo, a Vila Galé assegura: “até ao momento ainda não detectámos qualquer impacto do coronavírus nas reservas” da segunda maior cadeia hoteleira portuguesa.\nOs CTT, por seu turno, garantem que “os fluxos de exportação e importação para a China estão abertos e sem interrupções”, mas admitem que “têm verificado uma redução da oferta de transporte e uma alteração da normalidade da actividade económica chinesa, devido ao abrandamento da economia local”.\nA Vodafone responde que “nesta fase não se sente impacto do coronavírus na actividade” da operadora de telecomunicações em Portugal e questionada sobre a China como cliente e/ou fornecedora, garantiu que “está a acompanhar de perto a evolução da situação, em conjunto com fabricantes e fornecedores, de forma a minimizar os impactos que possam vir a existir no seu negócio”.\nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\nDa mesma forma, e “procurando antecipar e mitigar os eventuais impactos do vírus, a Altice Portugal está em contacto permanente com os seus parceiros, tendo já implementado medidas preventivas como o reforço das coberturas de stock de equipamentos”. “Já em termos do negócio”, acrescenta a Altice Portugal, enquanto operadora de telecomunicações, não está a sentir impacto imediato na sua actividade.\nFinalmente, a Nos tem “vindo a gerir” com os seus “parceiros de equipamentos os eventuais impactos que a evolução desta situação possa causar ao normal funcionamento da actividade” o grupo. Mas defende que, à data, “não existam motivos que justifiquem a antecipação de qualquer acção.”\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 6-China orders sharp cuts in flights in, out of country to curb coronavirus risk. BEIJING (Reuters) - China has ordered airlines to sharply cut the number of flights in and out of the country out of concern that travelers from overseas could reignite the coronavirus outbreak that paralyzed the country for two months.\nThe Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said on Thursday it had directed Chinese airlines to maintain only one route to any country and limit the number of flights to one per week, effective March 29.\nThe authority also ordered foreign airlines to reduce their international routes to China to one per week and only operate one route into the country.\n“In accordance with the need for epidemic containment, CAAC may issue policy to further reduce the total number of international passenger flights,” the regulator said in a statement.\nAround 80% of international flights were already being canceled prior to the announcement, but Chinese airlines had been asked not to cut their international routes until Thursday’s order by the CAAC.\nChina also will temporarily suspend the entry of foreigners with valid Chinese visas and residence permits starting on March 28, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.\nThe moves, in conjunction with severe quarantine rules now being imposed on people arriving in the country, are set to slow the flow of inbound travelers to a trickle.\nBeijing is keen to prevent a resurgence of the coronavirus epidemic that emerged in the Hubei region’s capital Wuhan in late 2019 and has killed nearly 3,300 Chinese citizens to date and more than 21,000 people globally.\nSevere curbs on travel and transport brought the epidemic under control in China but at a heavy price, with some analysts expecting an outright contraction for the country’s economy in the first quarter. Beijing is exhorting industries to reopen, but the virus, which has now spread around the globe, continues to threaten China’s economy and the health of its people.\nMainland China has not seen any new locally transmitted coronavirus cases in six of the past eight days, shifting the focus to preventing infected people arriving from overseas from triggering a fresh outbreak in the country. All 67 new cases reported by the end of Wednesday were imported, as were all 47 reported the previous day, the National Health Commission said earlier on Thursday, putting the total number of confirmed cases to date at 81,285.\nThe commission reported a total of 3,287 deaths by the end of Wednesday, up six from the previous day.\nHubei, home to some 60 million people, reported no new cases on Wednesday and opened its borders.\nThe lockdown of Hubei’s capital Wuhan, where the virus first appeared late last year, will be lifted on April 8, a milestone in China’s war against the epidemic.\nAbout 90% of all the imported cases are Chinese passport holders, Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui told a press conference, adding that 40% of those were overseas Chinese students returning amid rising infections abroad.\n“We understand some overseas students are eager to come home...But under the current circumstances, by staying put, they can avoid being cross-infected in the hurried journey home or getting stuck mid-journey when the countries they transit in tighten border controls,” Luo said.\nShanghai will make every international traveler arriving from 6 p.m. local time (1000 GMT) on Thursday go into quarantine for 14 days, the local government announced.\nIt had previously only required this for travelers who had visited any of 24 badly-hit countries in the previous two weeks.\n"}, {"content": "El coronavirus ya ha matado a 81 personas e infectado a cerca de 2.800 en China.

La temporada de año nuevo ha hecho que decenas de millones de migrantes en áreas urbanas hayan regresado a sus lugares de origen para reunirse con sus familias. “La concienciación (sobre el coronavirus) es relativamente baja en esas zonas. Tenemos que cubrir ese punto vulnerable”, ha sostenido el alto funcionario. Para conseguirlo, afirmó, se movilizará a los cuadros locales del Partido Comunista y los comités vecinales en cada comunidad.\nHoras antes, el alcalde de Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, había reconocido que cinco millones de personas habían abandonado la ciudad antes de que entrara en vigor la cuarentena que la mantiene bloqueada desde el jueves pasado a las 10 de la mañana, en una medida que se ha acabado extendiendo a una quincena más de localidades cercanas con una población total de 46 millones. Una de las prioridades es ahora localizar a esas personas para que se sometan a cuarentena y eviten propagar el virus, en caso de ser portadoras.\nMientras tanto, los gobiernos de varios países occidentales continúan las conversaciones con Pekín para evacuar a sus ciudadanos atrapados en Wuhan, donde permanecen una veintena de españoles. El Gobierno japonés ha indicado este lunes que espera fletar, posiblemente este mismo martes, un avión para repatriar a sus más de 500 compatriotas en esa ciudad.\nLas autoridades chinas han recomendado que se limiten los desplazamientos en la medida de lo posible y se eviten las aglomeraciones, para evitar el contagio.

Afinal, qual é o impacto das restrições das viagens na transmissão do novo coronavírus?

Medidas de saúde pública e mudanças comportamentais, como a detecção precoce de casos e lavar as mãos, são mais eficazes.\nA equipa coordenada pelo cientista Matteo Chinazzi, da Universidade do Nordeste (dos Estados Unidos), usou um modelo de transmissão da covid-19 chamado “Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEAM)”.  \nOs resultados já tinham sido divulgados no portal de investigação de ciências de saúde MedRxiv e foram publicados esta sexta-feira na revista científica Science.

Por fim, a equipa salienta mesmo que na presença de grandes restrições de viagens na China e para fora do país, um grande número de indivíduos já expostos ao novo coronavírus viajou pelo mundo sem ser detectado.\nEstes resultados poderão ser um contributo para cientistas, equipas médicas e políticos combaterem a epidemia. “No futuro, esperamos que as restrições das viagens a propósito da covid-19 nas áreas afectadas venham a ter efeitos modestos, e que as intervenções para reduzir a transmissão permitam obter grandes benefícios para mitigar a epidemia”, escrevem os autores no artigo. \n"}, {"content": "Confusion and lost time: how testing woes slowed China's coronavirus response. BEIJING (Reuters) - Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters.\nYang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease.\nYang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time.\n“My brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don’t get any new answers,” Zhang told Reuters. “Every time the responses are the same: ‘There’s no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what’s going on.’ The doctors are all very frustrated too.”\nOfficially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan. 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travelers from China for the virus within three days.\nHowever, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan’s hospitals until about Jan. 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities.\nDuring that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China.\nDespite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being “rumor spreaders.”\n“The doctor didn’t wear a mask, we didn’t know how to protect ourselves... no one told us anything,” a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan. 20, five days after she was hospitalized. “I posted my aunt’s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.”\nNational, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some “loopholes” in initial treatment methods.\nWuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognized that “all parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information.” But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders.\n“In local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I’m authorized,” he said. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested.\nChina last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak.\nThe country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. However, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned.\nOnce a virus has been identified, “You need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you’ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.\nAlthough information from the region is scarce, Adalja suggested China has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. “We’re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,” he said.\nJohn Edmunds, a professor at the center for mathematical modeling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said China has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak.\n“We have a very incomplete picture of what’s going on,” he told Reuters. “Whether it’s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, I don’t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.”\nThe shortage of testing supplies and China’s initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people.\n“The improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus’s genome, building new hospitals at a moment’s notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,” said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan’s Center for Chinese Studies.\nCity managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. The week in which no new virus cases were reported in Hubei coincided with preparations for the Lunar New Year and sessions of the province’s National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.\nSeven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said.\nBut four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials.\nTo qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is “impossible to conduct the test right away,” an official at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters.\nThree hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll.\nWuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters.\n“Some severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn’t be able to be treated,” the worker told Reuters. “The actual deaths were higher.”\nReuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker’s account. Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nZhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus.\nHowever, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test.\nNone of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment.\nSixty-nine year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan. 8, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told Reuters. Xu’s symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties.\nHe was finally admitted on Jan. 22 to queue for the test at Hankou hospital in Wuhan after his daughter publicized his case on Weibo.\nResearchers at Lancaster University estimate that only 5.1% of infections in Wuhan have been identified. By Jan. 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. More than 30,000 people in Wuhan are under observation, according to the city’s health authorities.\n“All we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,” said a 33-year-old Wuhan woman surnamed Liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since Jan. 14 and was still untested on Monday. “At least if it’s confirmed we have a direction. If there’s no direction, there’s no hope.”\n"}, {"content": "Social distancing due to coronavirus: Satellite data suggest no large-scale decrease in emissions in India. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or Covid-19, has forced countries across the world to take extreme steps - one of these has been a complete lockdown of cities.\nBoth China and Italy adopted these extreme measures in order to contain the outbreak once it went out of control. While there is no conclusive way to quantify the effect of restricted human activity, its imprint on atmosphere is somewhat measurable.\nScientists have observed a pattern which links a decreased level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), first over China and now over Italy, since the implementation of mass quarantines.\nNitrogen dioxide is usually emitted into the atmosphere as a result of human activities such as motor vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities.\nBoth National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) and European Space Agency (ESA) experts link the decrease in NO2 levels with an effective decrease in machine-run activities in these areas.\nWHAT ABOUT INDIA?\nIndia has taken several steps to contain the spreading of the novel coronavirus - state governments as well as Union governments have issued multiple advisories and orders to restrict community spread, as much as possible.\nBelow are NO2 levels on February 7.\nBelow are NO2 levels on March 16,\nMost administrations have ordered closing educational institutions, cinema halls and cancelled sporting events.\nWhile there are no strict orders against domestic movements and industrial gatherings, the government has advised citizens to avoid travel and meetings.\nEven Prime Minister Narendra Modi has encouraged people to work from home.\nHowever, satellite data from the ESA show that there is negligible reduction in NO2 levels.\nThe data was collected between February 17 to March 16, 2020. This shows that despite all the advisories, the reduction in overall outdoor human activities in India has not been enough to leave a large imprint in the atmosphere.\nThis, however, may not be the exact assessment of all the activities happening on the ground, but it gives a sense of a quantifiable changes caused in the atmosphere due to large-scale human activities. Although, the situation in India is nowhere similar to that in China or Europe, these governments along with those of the UK and USA have been criticised for not taking similar measures sooner.\nWhen it comes to the novel coronavirus outbreak, the global science community has reached a consensus that no step is enough and preemptive measures are more effective in these situations.\nWhile experts world over are advising the governments to take more drastic measures to contain the outbreak into new areas, large-scale isolation and absence of public gatherings have shown effective results.\n"}, {"content": "WRAPUP 11-China reports big rise in coronavirus deaths, WHO sees no 'tip of iceberg'. BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - The Chinese province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak reported a record rise in deaths and thousands more infections using a broader definition on Thursday, while Japan became the third place outside mainland China to suffer a fatality.\nThe epidemic has given China’s ruling Communist Party one of its sternest challenges in years, constrained the world’s second largest economy and triggered a purge of provincial bureaucrats.\nWith China’s streets, restaurants and flower markets bare, a miserable Valentine’s Day was expected on Friday.\nJapan confirmed its first coronavirus death - a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo - adding to two previous fatalities in Hong Kong and the Philippines. For all related coverage on the outbreak, click: here\nFor related Reuters graphics on the new coronavirus, click: tmsnrt.rs/2GVwIyw\nJapan is one of the worst affected of more than two dozen other countries and territories that have seen hundreds of infections from the flu-like sickness.\nThe Japanese woman fell ill in January but only later showed symptoms of pneumonia and was hospitalized, with coronavirus confirmed after her death and the contagion route under investigation, the health minister said.\nHowever, the big jump in China’s reported cases reflects a decision by authorities there to reclassify a backlog of suspected cases by using patients’ chest images, and is not necessarily the “tip of an iceberg” of a wider epidemic, a top World Health Organization official said on Thursday.\nMike Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies program, said that more than 14,000 new cases reported in Hubei province overnight came after a change to include results from quicker computerized tomography (CT) scans that reveal lung infections, rather than relying just on laboratory tests to confirm cases.\n“We’ve seen this spike in the number of cases reported in China, but this does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,” Ryan told a briefing in Geneva.\nThe biggest cluster of infections outside China is on a cruise liner now quarantined off a Japanese port and a further 44 cases were reported on board on Thursday, raising the total to 219. But authorities said some elderly people would finally to be allowed to disembark on Friday.\n“Outside the cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship we are not seeing a dramatic increase in transmission outside China,” the WHO’s Ryan said.\nHe added that the main U.N. health agency expected the rest of a special WHO team to arrive in China over the coming weekend to investigative the epicenter of the epidemic.\nU.S. President Donald Trump praised China over its response and said Washington was working closely with Beijing. “I think they’ve handled it professionally, and I think they’re extremely capable,” Trump said in a podcast broadcast on iHeart Radio.\nBut Trump’s top White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, was more critical. “We’re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese, these numbers are jumping around... there was some surprise,” he told reporters.\nIn central China’s Hubei province, officials said 242 people died on Wednesday, the biggest daily rise since the flu-like virus emerged in the provincial capital Wuhan in December.\nTotal deaths in China are 1,367.\nThe rise, following a forecast earlier this week by China’s senior medical adviser that the epidemic might end there by April, halted a global stocks rally. [MKTS/GLOB]\nBut it appeared largely due to the change in methodology.\nHubei had previously only allowed infections to be confirmed by RNA tests, which can take days. RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries genetic information allowing identification of viruses.\nBut it has also begun using CT scans of lungs, the Hubei health commission said, to pinpoint and isolate cases faster.\nAs a result, another 14,840 new cases were reported in the province on Thursday, up from 2,015 new cases nationwide a day earlier. But excluding cases confirmed using the new methods, the number of new cases rose by only 1,508.\nAbout 60,000 people have been infected in total, the vast majority of them in China.\nThe outbreak, believed to have emerged from a Wuhan market where wildlife was traded illegally, has triggered a backlash against local political leaders.\nProvincial Communist Party boss Jiang Chaoliang was fired as secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee, and Ma Guoqiang removed as party chief in Wuhan, state media said. They were the two highest-profile officials to be axed since the outbreak.\nChinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are weeks away, although WHO chiefs have cautioned a vaccine could take 18 months.\nWhile the Princess Diamond cruise liner remained in quarantine, another luxury liner, the MS Westerdam, was finally allowed to dock in Cambodia after being barred from Guam, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand over fears that one of its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus - even though none had tested positive.\nThe Westerdam’s passengers clapped and cheered on their arrival at sunset.\n"}, {"content": "False claim: 5G networks are making people sick, not Coronavirus. Facebook users have been sharing posts claiming 5G, not the coronavirus, is making people sick (  here  ).\nThe posts go on to include a list of various further claims that deny the reality of the virus and include various conspiracy-type arguments about the coronavirus.\nThe coronavirus outbreak started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The Center for Disease Control says on its website the virus had links to a \"seafood and live animal market\" where a human might have contracted the virus from an animal. The virus then spread person-to-person (  here  ). The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, tiredness, cough, and shortness of breath that can appear  two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus (  here  ). The coronavirus is spread person-to-person (  here  ).\nMobile phones use radio waves. They send and receive radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMFs). 5G uses \"beam-forming technology\", which allows radiofrequency electromagnetic fields to go directly where needed (  here  ).\nThe International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) after 7 years of research released 2020 guidelines on limiting exposure to electromagnetic fields. They include information about 5G.\nThe commission says the main effect that radiofrequency electromagnetic fields have on the human body is increased temperature of exposed tissue. The body can handle small increases to body temperature, such as through exercising, but radiofrequency exposure and increased temperature can be dangerous above a certain threshold (  here  ).\nAccording to the ICNIRP, \"Another general characteristic of RF EMFs is that the higher the frequency, the lower the depth of penetration of the EMFs into the body. As 5G technologies can utilize higher EMF frequencies (>24 GHz) in addition to those currently used (<4 GHz), power from those higher frequencies will be primarily absorbed more superficially than that from previous mobile telecommunications technologies […] Accordingly, 5G exposures will not cause any harm providing that they adhere to the ICNIRP (2020) guidelines\" (  here  ).\nEric van Rongen, Chairman of ICNIRP, said in a video that there is no evidence that electromagnetic fields cause health effects such as cancer, electrohypersensitivity, infertility or anything else. The only two recognized health effects are nerve stimulation in up to 10 MHz and heating from 100 kHz (  here  ).\nThe World Health Organization says no research has linked exposure to wireless technology with negative health effects (  here  ). WHO said on its website it will continue to review research in this area and is conducting a \"health risk assessment\" of all radiofrequency ranges that will be available in 2022.\nMarvin C. Ziskin, Professor Emeritus of Radiology and Medical Physics, said there is no basis to expect that 5G would cause adverse health issues provided exposure limits are respected.\nZiskin told Reuters, “The weight of scientific evidence indicates that 5G emissions are not cumulative. That is, multiple exposures of innocuous exposures do not add to produce any adverse biological effect. I would add that there have been no health agency warnings about possible health risks of RF energy including millimeter waves at exposure levels that an average consumer would experience from communications technology. This is consistent with assessments of the issue by standards-setting groups such as IEEE and ICNIRP.”\nCoronavirus symptoms can be found in detail on official government and international health organization sites. They bear no similarity to possible health effects stemming from mobile phone or 5G use.\nFalse: There is no connection between the outbreak of COVID-19 and possible 5G health effects.\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

However, the rest of the world also has exposure as a result of a hit to global tourism in the first half of this year and short-term disruptions to supply chains,\" it said.\n\"The effects on the global economy could compound if the rate of infection does not abate and the death toll continues to rise, because supply chain disruptions in manufacturing would become more acute the longer it takes to restore normalcy,\" Moody's added.\nThe death toll from China's coronavirus epidemic rose to over 1,660, with over 68,500 confirmed cases.\nThe coronavirus outbreak originated in central China's Hubei province in December last year and has spread to several countries.\nMany countries have banned arrivals from China, while major airlines have suspended flights to the country.\n"}, {"content": "Businesses in faraway Namibia feel coronavirus fear.

WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - The Trump administration cut staff by more than two-thirds at a key United States public health agency operating inside China, as part of a larger rollback of US-funded health and science experts on the ground there leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has learnt. \n Most of the reductions were made at the Beijing office of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and occurred over the past two years, according to public CDC documents viewed by Reuters and interviews with four people familiar with the drawdown. \n The Atlanta-based CDC, America's pre-eminent disease fighting agency, provides public health assistance to nations around the world and works with them to help stop outbreaks of contagious diseases from spreading globally. It has worked in China for 30 years. \n The CDC's China headcount has shrunk to around 14 staff members, down from approximately 47 people since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, the documents show. The four people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the losses included epidemiologists and other health professionals. \n The material reviewed by Reuters shows a breakdown of how many American and local Chinese employees were assigned there. \n The documents are the CDC's own descriptions of its headcount, which it posts online. Reuters was able to search past copies of the material to confirm the decline described by the four people. \n \"The CDC office in Beijing is a shell of its former self,\" said one of the people, a US official who worked in China at the time of the drawdown. \n Separately, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the global relief programme which had a role in helping China monitor and respond to outbreaks, also shut their Beijing offices on Mr Trump's watch. Before the closures, each office was staffed by a US official. In addition, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) transferred the manager of an animal disease monitoring programme out of China in 2018. \n Reductions at the US agencies sidelined health experts, scientists and other professionals who might have been able to help China mount an earlier response to the novel coronavirus, as well as provide the US government with more information about what was coming, according to the people who spoke with Reuters. The Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and for keeping US experts from entering the country to assist. \n \"We had a large operation of experts in China who were brought back during this administration, some of them months before the outbreak,\" said one of the people who witnessed the withdrawal of US personnel. \"You have to consider the possibility that our drawdown made this catastrophe more likely or more difficult to respond to.\" \n The White House declined to comment or respond to questions from Reuters regarding the US withdrawal of staff in China. \n The CDC did not respond to detailed questions submitted by Reuters about the cuts. It has insisted its staffing levels did not hinder the US response to the coronavirus. \n \"There are many factors that go into decisions around staffing,\" the CDC said in a statement. \n Some health experts were sceptical that more CDC employees operating inside China would have made a difference in stemming the outbreak. Beijing has been widely criticised for silencing its own public health officials who warned of a deadly new respiratory disease emanating from the Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. \n \"The problem was China, not that we didn't have CDC people in China,\" said Dr Scott McNabb, a former CDC epidemiologist who is now a research professor with Emory University. He pointed to China's censorship as the main culprit in the spread of the pandemic, which has infected at least 435,470 people worldwide, killed 19,598 and upended the global economy. \n China's embassy in Washington, DC declined to comment. \n The NSF closed all foreign offices in 2018, according to spokesman Robert Margetta. He said the agency planned on \"sending teams on short-term expeditions around the world to find ways to increase international collaborations.\" \n A USAID spokesman said the decision to shutter its Beijing office was \"due to significantly decreased access to Chinese government officials as well as the Agency's position that the Chinese model of development is not aligned with US values and interests\". \n The USDA confirmed that it moved a manager position out of Beijing. A spokesman said the department has retained an office in China that employs eight people: five Americans and three Chinese. The office monitors animal disease and helps resolve \"trade-related issues as they occur at Chinese ports of entry,\" the spokesman said. \n Reuters first reported about changes to CDC staffing in China on Sunday. The news agency revealed that the Trump administration had eliminated the position of a US trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists, who were deployed to the epicentre of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases. \n In a press briefing on Sunday, Mr Trump criticised the Reuters story as \"100 per cent wrong\". Yet the CDC acknowledged the position had been cut. The agency said the decision was made because of China's \"excellent technical capability,\" and said the elimination of that post did not hamper the US effort to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. \n The CDC staffing documents newly reviewed by Reuters show a sharp decline in the overall number of employees at the agency in Beijing, with 33 out of 47 positions lost. \n The documents show the breakdown between American and Chinese staff members. The number of so-called American \"assignees\" declined to three positions from eight at the outset of the administration. Positions lost included medical epidemiologists and other experts in infectious diseases. \n The biggest cuts were to positions filled by Chinese employees on the US payroll, down to around 10 from 40 over the same period. Many of those local hires included medical and disease experts, according to the people who spoke with Reuters. \n \"Local staffers stayed even longer at the CDC and had a real depth of knowledge,\" one of the people said. \"There's a loss of deep expertise and institutional knowledge.\" \n The CDC told Reuters the three Americans currently on staff in China are a country director, an influenza expert and an information technology expert. A temporary deputy director arrived recently, and that job will be filled permanently, the agency said in a statement. In addition, two Chinese staffers continue to work on specific public health areas, including the training programme, according to the statement. \n The shuttered USAID and NSF offices in China also had a role in building scientific relationships and combating global disease, according to the four people familiar with the situation. \n USAID's Beijing office, which was staffed by a senior US officer and two Chinese employees, was working on initiatives including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and malaria, the people said. The office closed in 2019. \n The NSF office was once led by Dr Nancy Sung, a respected American scientist who was a key link between the US and Chinese scientific communities, according to the US government official who spoke with Reuters. The office also employed two local staff members. \n \"She had far more contacts than most of us,\" said the official, who had been in China at the time and was familiar with her role. \"She could have helped maintain vital channels of communication between the two countries which to this day is greatly curtailed.\" \n Dr Sung, who is now with the NSF in the United States, declined to comment about the closure of her office in 2018 and referred questions to the agency's public affairs office. \n The changes came amid escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing. Mr Trump has long complained that China has stolen millions of American jobs and intellectual property, charges the Chinese government has rejected as baseless. The countries have slapped billions in tariffs on each other's goods. Now their leaders are battling to control the narrative over the pandemic. \n Mr Trump has called it the \"Chinese virus\" to keep the focus on China's role in unleashing the pandemic. China, meanwhile, is trying to assert global leadership by providing aid to Italy and other hard-hit countries. \n Over the last two years, the White House has pushed US agencies with a presence in China to de-fund programmes there along with the positions to manage them, according to the US official who spoke to Reuters. \n The source said Mr Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and a former Republican governor of Iowa, tried to remind the White House of the importance of the US presence in China but was told to \"get with the programme\" by an administration official. \n \"The White House saw the relationship as one-sided and without benefit to the US,\" the source said. \n A State Department spokesman said in a statement that the US Embassy in China is \"one of our largest, reflecting the many areas of bilateral engagement\". \n \"Since Ambassador Branstad's arrival, the US Mission to China has maintained robust staffing to advance important foreign policy goals on behalf of the American people,\" the statement said. \"Staffing levels for the numerous federal agencies and sections have, on the whole, held steady and in some cases increased.\" \n After Reuters' story about the elimination of the key CDC position in China ran on Sunday, Mr Trump's re-election campaign seized on it for fund raising. In a mass e-mail to supporters, it accused Mr Trump's critics of \"siding with the Chinese\" and helping Beijing with a \"cover-up\". \n The CDC on Monday told Reuters that its director Dr Robert Redfield had decided to add a global health threats programme director to its China staff. \n \"At the request of Dr Redfield, CDC is continuing to look long term at possible additions to enhance CDC's 30 plus year presence in China,\" the statement said. \n "}, {"content": "India reports first case of Coronavirus; Kerala woman tests positive.

Study of positive coronavirus cases in two of the worst affected countries, China and Italy points to somewhat selective pattern of the spread of Covid-19. That the novel coronavirus targets the older people and avoids the young ones. \nSituation gets complicated leading to deaths if the elderly patient already has some medical issues such as breathing problems, diabetes, heart-related ailments and kidney problems. \nThe mean age of those succumbing to novel coronavirus in Italy was reported to be 81 last week. Italy is known as the country with old population; more than 60 per cent of its total population is over 40. This is said to have contributed to more infections and deaths in Italy than places such as South Korea or even Japan.\nChina too is considered a country of aging peopulation. This refers to share of elderly people (above 60) crossing 10 per cent in the total population. China's elderly (above 60) are more than 17 per cent in its total population. Incidentally in China, the Centre for Disease Control reached a similar conclusion as Italy after examining over 72,000 cases that the disease is deadlier in older people. This is also the conclusion of the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nIn India, all the three deaths due to novel coronavirus infection have happened in the cases of elderly patients. The youngest of them was 64. All had previous medical conditions.\nTwo main reasons have been attributed to this age specific coronavirus spread pattern. First, it is a medical fact that immunity is strongest in childhood and decreases with advancement in age. DNA, the genetic material that guides most functions of human body, is agile in childhood and responds quicker to alien particles entering the body. This boosts immunity. With advancement of age, the DNA messaging gets corrupted and the right message to disease fighting cells are not delivered efficiently.\nSecondly, in most countries, coronavirus testing are symptomatic in process. That is, only those showing synonyms are being tested for novel coronavirus infection. This means a number of children may be passing off without being tested for novel coronavirus. \nWith stronger immunity, children may not show symptoms of novel coronavirus infection even if they have contracted the contagion. Untested children means more adults entering the records and hence further skew in the final data.\nThis does not mean that children are completely immune to novel coronavirus infection. At two cases -- one each from China and the UK -- were reported about newborns having tested positive for novel coronavirus. Though, the disease Covid-19 has not been found to be transferring from mother to child during pregnancy. A three-year-old child tested positive for Covid-19 in India. She is the youngest Covid-19 patient in India.\nBut the fact that children are largely untested underscores that they can be carriers or vectors of novel coronavirus. Also, medical conditions like asthma and diabetes are not uncommon among children. In many cases obesity-linked diabetes and asthma are related. In such cases, novel coronavirus infection can be fatal for children.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus in India: 44 infected so far, virus reaches Punjab, Karnataka and J&K | 10 developments.

SINGAPORE — Tired and hungry after a long day at work, Mr Derrick Tay was looking forward to returning home for a warm shower, having something to eat and watching Netflix in bed.  \n But something caught his attention while he was mindlessly thumbing through his phone in the train around 9pm on Friday a week ago: Images of shoppers making a mad dash for groceries at supermarkets across the island.  \n While Singaporeans have earned a reputation for being kiasu (Hokkien for the fear of missing out), it was a scene that no one has witnessed here before — not even during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003 or the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.  \n Just hours earlier, the Ministry of Health (MOH) had raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) risk assessment level from Yellow to Orange. \n The Dorscon level was raised after several Covid-19 cases were detected in the Republic without any links to previous cases or travel histories to China.  \n “I was shocked by what I saw on my phone. When I got home, I told my parents about it,” Mr Tay, 31, said. \n His mother had planned to do her weekly grocery run on Saturday but he told her to do it that night as he “wasn’t sure if there would be anything left for her to buy in the morning at the rate people were wiping out the shelves”.   \n  Customers at Fairprice Finest in Bukit Timah Plaza on Feb 7, 2020, after the Dorscon alert level was changed to Orange. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n The mother and son then headed to their neighbourhood’s mini-mart in Choa Chu Kang.  \n “It was crazy that day. I’ve never seen so many people inside before, and at such a late hour. There was a queue that wound around the inside of the store,” said Mr Tay, who ended up having to wait for more than 30 minutes to pay for his purchases.  \n His basket of groceries held a bag of rice, four packs of assorted instant noodle flavours, a bottle of oil and several cans of tuna and sardine. \n His 72-year-old mother, who helped carry two bags’ worth of toilet paper, told him that she could not remember Singaporeans panicking like this. \n Despite reassurances from government leaders including Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing who took to Facebook to call for calm, Mr Tay and many Singaporeans were not entirely assured as the panic buying continued through the night. \n In fact, Mr Tay was still in the queue when he read Mr Chan’s Facebook post but he went on to complete his purchases.  \n He told TODAY that his actions were partly shaped by the mask situation. The Government had made clear that it has a stockpile of masks but this did not prevent long queues or stocks running out at shops and pharmacies.    \n What happened was that the Government had released five million masks to retailers over nine days last month but these were sold out within hours. As a result, the Government decided to distribute the masks from its stockpile directly to families, capped at four masks per household. At the same time, it has reiterated that there is no need for people to wear a mask if they are well and it is more important to practise good personal hygiene such as washing hands.  \n Singapore, like many countries, has been grappling with a mask shortage since the health crisis started, sparked by a sudden surge in demand. \n  The Government has distributed masks from its stockpile directly to families, capped at four masks per household. Photo: Najeer Yusof/TODAY \n While many like Mr Tay understood the constraints and logistical challenges involved, as far as they are concerned, the takeaway was that they had great difficulty getting masks from retailers and ultimately, had to rely on a limited number given out by the Government.  \n And even if supplies are in no danger of running out, Mr Tay argued that it would not hurt to be prepared.  \n “Anyway, if there’s no emergency, we’ll just take it as having done a few days’ worth of shopping beforehand,” he said.  \n While Mr Tay and his mother had joined the hordes of shoppers at the supermarkets, their purchase was relatively measured compared to the others: Pictures of shoppers with overflowing trolleys went viral, along with photographs and videos of empty vegetable and fruit baskets, and chillers devoid of meat.    \n Still, some like Dr Paul Tambyah felt it was understandable why these shoppers behaved the way they did.  \n Noting that Singapore, along with the rest of the world, would have to deal with the outbreak for the next several months, Dr Tambyah – who is president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection – noted that in such a situation, it was practical to keep some essential supplies on standby in case one has to be put on quarantine, for instance.   \n “As far as I know, when a quarantine officer comes to put a person on quarantine, they do not let you go shopping at the supermarket first,” he said. \n To allay public anxiety, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made a speech a day after the panic buying, assuring Singaporeans that there was no need to panic as the city was not being locked down, and there was ample supply of food for everyone.  \n Now that a sense of normalcy has returned, questions remain to be answered: What caused all that panic-buying over that fateful weekend, which had left some quarters fuming — and embarrassed — over the behaviour of “ugly Singaporeans”, and others to question whatever happened to decades of efforts aimed at building a resilient society? \n And what does it say about Singaporeans, many of whom have stoically and quietly got on with their lives, despite the uncertainty and disruptions to daily life?   \n THE SITUATION ELSEWHERE \n As of Friday, Singapore has 67 confirmed cases of Covid-19 — the highest outside of China where the vast majority of cases are concentrated.  \n Including Hong Kong and Macau, China has reported almost 64,000 cases to date and the count continues to rise.  \n So far, apart from Singapore, there have been no reports of panic buying in places outside of China.  Residents in Thailand for example, which has 33 confirmed cases as of Friday, told TODAY that the situation was calm and there has been no run on daily essentials.  \n Some experts believe that events in Hong Kong, which was gripped by scenes of panic buying recently, had influenced Singaporeans’ behaviour.  \n Speaking to TODAY, Mr Wong Bai Chun, a Hong Kong citizen, said that two weeks ago, there was a brief but acute shortage of toilet paper and other paper goods in the territory, which was sparked by an Internet rumour that the Chinese spring holiday was being extended and there would be insufficient supplies of such products. \n Mr Wong said the fear over paper shortage had spread to other goods in Hong Kong. “Now you can’t find rice anywhere,” said the 26-year-old who works in the finance industry. \n Unlike Macau or mainland China, there are no regulations in Hong Kong to curb such behaviours, he added. \n He said the panic buying and hoarding of daily essentials in Hong Kong stemmed from the shortage of disposable masks.  \n “At the moment, people are sourcing their masks from all over the world and there’s simply not enough,” he said. “Hong Kong doesn’t have the capacity to manufacture sufficient amounts of them.”     Mr Wong Bai Chun, a Hong Kong citizen, told TODAY that the city folks started hoarding long before Singaporeans did. He said it all started with the shortage of disposable masks. Photo: Reuters \n While the panic-buying in Hong Kong mirrors what happened in Singapore, the similarity ends there. \n For one, there is no risk of Singapore running short of essential food and household items like toilet paper from short-term disruptions, such as the Covid-19 outbreak, said Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli. \n The country has managed to be resilient due to astute planning by the nation’s food agencies and its well-connected transport network, he said on Feb 10 during the launch of the 2020 Singapore Food Story. The food security strategy aims to meet 30 per cent of the country’s nutritional needs by 2030 using less than 1 per cent of its land area.  \n On the evening of the panic buying in Singapore, Mr Seah Kian Peng, who is the chief executive of supermarket cooperative NTUC Fairprice, also assured the public that there were sufficient supplies of daily essentials in the warehouse.  \n However, as experts pointed out, rationality and logic get cast aside when panic sets in. \n “Research suggests that when people are in panic, the thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system and we start to act illogically,” said a spokesperson for the Singapore Psychological Society (SPS) council. “Our ability to decide on our own is minimised.” \n OTHER TRIGGERS \n Among the possible factors behind the panic buying was negativity bias where people’s brains tend to focus more on negative information than positive ones, said the SPS spokesperson. \n “Our brains are hardwired to register negative stimuli more readily and also to dwell and worry on them for a longer period of time,” the spokesperson told TODAY. \n Furthermore, whenever there is a life-threatening epidemic or emergency, the notions of safety, protection, and self-preservation usually come into play.  \n The spokesperson also noted people also tend to follow others in the hope that the latter could get them out of a dangerous situation.  \n In Singapore’s case, this could be a possible reason why people started to hoard or buy things impulsively if everyone else around them was doing the same, or if they were told to do so on social media platforms. \n This phenomenon of groupthink results in irrational and dysfunctional thinking and outcomes.  \n “In this case, our brains focus more on the fear generated rather than on the reassurance given,” said the spokesperson.  \n Mr Lars Voedisch, the managing director of public relations firm PRecious Communications, said that such behaviour is triggered by one or two initial incidents which then get amplified by social media. \n “(This leads) to a snowball effect of more and more people thinking of it, then hearing from the first people acting on their fear, sharing about it and through that fuelling the whole panic,” he said. \n The images of empty shelves circulating on social media played a big part, said Singapore Management University sociologist Paulin Straughan.   “This meant that people were no longer reacting to rumours that essentials might run out, but this new development itself,” she said. “Which is: The shelves are empty. Better start to go now.”    \n  Shoppers at Fairprice Finest in Bukit Timah Plaza reaching out for toilet paper even before it got stocked in the shelves. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n Professor Straughan, whose research interests include medical sociology that encompasses infectious diseases, said it did not help that the public was seeing these images circulated on social media late in the night. As a result, these became the abiding images for many Singaporeans overnight.  \n “For the next 12 hours, the shelves remain empty (in their minds),” she said. “And that’s 12 hours of festering, and it entrenches (the fear that there are no supplies).” \n Agreeing with Mr Voedisch’s observation about social media, Prof Straughan reiterated that while technology has helped to disseminate information a lot faster, it has similarly allowed misinformation to spread just as quickly as well. \n This was not something that Singaporeans had to worry about during the past virus outbreaks, she added. \n The SPS council spokesperson noted that when the Covid-19 virus was first made known, there was an overwhelming amount of news and social media coverage. \n “When the Dorscon Orange was finally announced, it became a trigger tantamount to saying ‘the coronavirus has arrived’, resulting in the accompanying hoarding behaviour as response,” the spokesperson said.  \n Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Professor May Oo Lwin, whose research interest at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI) includes strategic and health communications, said it is likely that the public was responding to certain levels of fear and stress that the deluge of messages had aroused.   \n She explained that scientists have pointed to a phenomenon where communication leading to fear and stressful emotions can cause unintended consequences.   \n Such messages, she said, needed to be concurrently countered with provision of strategies for coping with perceived threats.   \n “In this particular case, all the media information is likely to have induced strong emotive elements which were managed by some population segments by embracing these forms of rational or irrational, but culturally symbolic, behaviours,” said Prof Lwin. \n In other words, some segments of the population “may undertake actions based around daily priorities to respond to their perceptions of the threat”, said the health communications expert. For example, in extreme cases of crisis like an earthquake, people could be seen taking their television sets while evacuating, she noted.  \n That could explain why stacks of toilet paper were snapped up by Singaporeans during the panic buying. Prof Straughan had another theory: They were relatively cheap and easy to hoard. “We all want to do something to make ourselves feel better,” she quipped. \n PUBLIC COMMS ‘COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER’  \n Communications experts told TODAY that the panic-buying in Singapore might have been avoided if the information disseminated by the authorities had been clearer.  \n “The problem with the message was that it was too bureaucratic at the start,” said Assistant Professor Liew Kai Khiun, who teaches at NTU's WKWSCI. “Much of the Government’s message involved military terms (and) colour codes.\" \n Prof Straughan agreed, noting that the definition of Dorscon Orange was not explained enough as well. \n Dorscon is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation.  \n Orange refers to a situation in which a virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. Previously, the risk assessment level was at Yellow, signifying that the virus was severe and could infect from person to person, but was chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The highest level, Red, indicates that the virus is spreading widely and can result in major disruption such as closing schools. \n “Some people didn’t know what it meant. All they saw was the visual,” said Prof Straughan. “There are four levels. Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. Red is bad, everybody knows that right? Green is good. Now Orange. It is closer to Red than it is to Green. So visually, it lights up all your flags.”  \n Asst Prof Liew pointed out while the message from the authorities was accurate, it did not cater to the layman. To that end, they could have used dialect or Singlish to reach out more effectively, he noted.  \n During the Sars outbreak in 2003, local sitcom character Phua Chu Kang was used to educate Singaporeans on the importance of washing their hands.  This, he said, was an effective way of reaching out to the public, and many people still remember it today. \n A leaked MOH press release a few hours before the official Dorscon Orange announcement, which left many befuddled, might have also fuelled the public panic.  \n The press release was circulated on social media and through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp. \n Up till this incident, Prof Straughan felt that the Government had been doing well in being upfront with Singaporeans about the virus situation. But when the press release was prematurely leaked out, it created some confusion.  \n She said it did not help that recipients of the leaked document were initially told by others that it was fake news, only to be informed by the authorities a few hours later that it was indeed true.   \n Such contradictory information would have led some to question if the authorities were trying to hide something, she said.  \n The authorities have yet to announce the source of the leak, but Trade and Industry Minister Chan said on Feb 9 that the various agencies involved in tackling the virus will remind their staff that they have a professional responsibility not to prematurely share information that has not been finalised. \n Despite these short-comings in public communications, some experts felt that Prime Minister Lee’s nine-minute long speech on Feb 8 went some way in restoring a sense of normalcy. \n The SPS council spokesperson said Mr Lee’s message gave people very concrete actions that “handed back a measure of control to people whose sense of control felt threatened”. \n Mr Voedisch of PRecious Communications said having the Prime Minister step in to address the public helped, because it went beyond technocratic statements and directly addressed what people were concerned with. \n “While authorities should not get emotional when communicating, they have to be empathetic appealing to the hearts and minds of the audience,” said Mr Voedisch. \n However, he was uncertain if an address by Mr Lee to the public at an earlier juncture would have helped.  \n Instead, he said that the authorities should have foreseen the responses from the public as part of proper scenario planning with “ready-to-go action plans”. \n Also, they should have anticipated and addressed the public’s concerns and fears across the different platforms, he added.  \n THE RAMIFICATIONS  \n Mr Chan, the Trade and Industry Minister, had spoken out against panic buying and hoarding behaviour by a “small segment of Singaporeans”, even though he noted that this was to be expected.  \n In a Facebook post on Feb 8, he noted that it was “natural” in times of uncertainty that people want to protect themselves and the ones that they love.  \n “However I urge all of us to think of the larger communities we belong to. Hoarding means that we deprive others of things that they really need,” he said. “That could be your neighbour who needs to buy rice for her children’s meals or even organisations looking after the vulnerable who require cleaning supplies.” \n Speaking to the media the next day, Mr Chan also said that the panic buying at supermarkets will signal to other countries that Singaporeans cannot react well in times of crisis and could be taken advantage of in the future. \n One potential consequence, he warned, is that suppliers and retailers who observe the panic buying might take advantage of the situation and jack up prices of goods. \n Ultimately, the hoarding behaviour was “a fight-or-flight response that has arisen primarily from fear and a need for self-preservation”, said the SPS council spokesperson. \n And this fear can breed distrust and hostility towards others. “With a constant overemphasis on fear, people may start to behave in less caring or more complacent ways in order to maintain self-preservation,” the spokesperson added.   \n HERE COMES THE GOOD \n Still, despite the panic buying grabbing the headlines, Mr Chan and other government leaders took pains to point out that a large majority of Singaporeans had been “calm and rational”.  \n Many Singaporeans had come forward to thank the cashiers and supermarket staff constantly working behind the scenes to restock the empty shelves, Mr Chan noted.   \n Countless others have also stepped in to do their part for their fellow citizens, with numerous ground-up initiatives started in the community. \n For example, TODAY had reported about two primary school girls who used their pocket money to buy and deliver breakfast to doctors and nurses. On Valentine’s Day which fell on Friday, community group StandUpForSG also gave out “love letters” to frontline healthcare workers. \n  \n (From left) Sisters Ruirui and Rui'en delivering breakfast to a healthcare worker on Feb 8, 2020. Photo: Tong Yee/ Facebook \n QUIET RESILIENCE  \n Away from the public spotlight and media glare, ordinary Singaporeans have got on with their lives, despite the disruptions and worries brought on by the Covid-19 outbreak.  \n Scores of Singaporeans — such as taxi and private-hire drivers, as well as those in the retail and tourism industries — have seen their livelihoods take a hit. Others have had to adjust to working from home as business continuity plans swung into place. \n Cleaners, for example, are putting in longer hours while healthcare workers not only have to work longer each day but are also putting themselves at risk on the frontlines.     \n A 23-year-old outbreak nurse who works with Covid-19 patients said that while her family understands the risks of her occupation, it does not stop them from worrying.  \n “Most nurses are worried too, but it’s our job and this is what we do for a living,” said the nurse, who wanted to be known only as Sharmaine due to the sensitivity of her role. \n When she was first assigned to handle suspected Covid-19 cases, Sharmaine said she was scared as no one knew what exactly they were dealing with.  \n “But over time, I grew immune to it, even if a patient were to test positive for the virus. Now I don't feel so scared anymore.” \n However, she feels disappointed at the discrimination against healthcare workers shown by some Singaporeans, even as many others expressed gratitude for their work.  “It truly is demoralising when you hear of such incidents. We feel ostracised at times because all we want to do is perform our job and go home,” she said. “But we continue to keep an open mind because we are the first line of defence.” \n  \n Messages from the public thanking healthcare workers for their hard work. These messages were put up on Facebook with the hashtag #braveheartsg, in response to the initiative by community group StandUpForSG. Photo: Facebook/Muru Nagaraju, Jocelyn Chng, JJ Huang, Dawn Yip \n A taxi driver, who wanted to be known as Mr Ahmad, said he is not scared and has no qualms about picking up healthcare workers.   \n Although his wife worries for him, as there is no way of knowing whether a passenger might be infected with the virus, the 56-year-old CityCab driver said he still has to continue driving to support his family.   \n The virus outbreak, he added, had drastically affected his earnings lately, though he declined to reveal by how much. \n “So far, even my friends (who are also taxi drivers) have all been continuing to work as per normal,” said Mr Ahmad.  \n The only difference is that he has taken some precautions, such as winding down the windows to air his vehicle after dropping off each passenger and disinfecting his steering wheel with Dettol, he added.  \n For 37-year-old father Lucas Chiam, he sought to turn the situation around by using it as an opportunity to spend more time with his two sons, aged six and four. \n Due to Covid-19, the lecturer and his wife decided to limit their children’s outings to the parks and playgrounds, where they would typically just keep an eye out for the youngsters’ safety. \n Instead, they introduced the boys to home-based activities which could involve the entire family, such as arts and craft, reading and even playing Xbox console games.  \n “I think the best we can do right now is to stay positive. This is an opportunity to bond with the kids, work on some home improvement tasks and plan for the year ahead,” Mr Chiam said.  \n “Maybe through these tough times, we can develop some new good habits for the family that will stay with us even after the threat is over.” \n Some businesses have had to adjust their operating models due to the outbreak. \n Ms Jazz Chong, the owner and director of contemporary gallery Ode To Art, has noticed fewer people visiting the gallery as well as the Raffles City Shopping Centre, where the gallery is located.   \n “With the virus outbreak becoming more severe, we have now decided to take the extra measure of bringing the art to our clients directly,” she said. “If they like the work then it can remain in their home, making it extra convenient for them as they do not even have to leave their house.” \n Meanwhile, curtain maker and supplier MC2 held its first Facebook Live event on Feb 11. \n Mr Wilson Chew, the founder and managing director of the company, said: “During this time of crisis when people may be worried about attending events with crowds, we thought of using Facebook Live.” \n By broadcasting live on the social media platform, customers were given the chance to ask questions and interact with the company’s salesperson in real time as he gave demonstrations of the company’s various zip-blind products.  \n Business owners like Ms Chong and Mr Chew are hoping that people would continue life as normal, albeit taking the necessary precautions.  \n Or as NTU’s Asst Prof Liew put it: “We must have a courageous sense of normality and go on living life normally.”  \n Indeed, Prime Minister Lee noted on Friday that the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to last longer than Sars, with a greater impact already hitting the economy.   But he stressed: “We have to keep Singapore going and we have to keep making a living. Life has to go on.”     \n   \n   \n "}, {"content": "Cientistas acreditam ter descoberto origem do vírus mortal que já se propagou por todo o Mundo.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters.\nYang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease.\nYang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time.\n“My brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don’t get any new answers,” Zhang told Reuters. “Every time the responses are the same: ‘There’s no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what’s going on.’ The doctors are all very frustrated too.”\nOfficially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan. 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travelers from China for the virus within three days.\nHowever, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan’s hospitals until about Jan. 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities.\nDuring that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China.\nDespite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being “rumor spreaders.”\n“The doctor didn’t wear a mask, we didn’t know how to protect ourselves... no one told us anything,” a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan. 20, five days after she was hospitalized. “I posted my aunt’s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.”\nNational, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some “loopholes” in initial treatment methods.\nWuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognized that “all parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information.” But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders.\n“In local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I’m authorized,” he said. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested.\nChina last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak.\nThe country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. However, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned.\nOnce a virus has been identified, “You need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you’ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.\nAlthough information from the region is scarce, Adalja suggested China has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. “We’re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,” he said.\nJohn Edmunds, a professor at the center for mathematical modeling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said China has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak.\n“We have a very incomplete picture of what’s going on,” he told Reuters. “Whether it’s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, I don’t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.”\nThe shortage of testing supplies and China’s initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people.\n“The improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus’s genome, building new hospitals at a moment’s notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,” said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan’s Center for Chinese Studies.\nCity managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. The week in which no new virus cases were reported in Hubei coincided with preparations for the Lunar New Year and sessions of the province’s National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.\nSeven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said.\nBut four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials.\nTo qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is “impossible to conduct the test right away,” an official at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters.\nThree hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll.\nWuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters.\n“Some severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn’t be able to be treated,” the worker told Reuters. “The actual deaths were higher.”\nReuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker’s account. Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nZhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus.\nHowever, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test.\nNone of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment.\nSixty-nine year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan. 8, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told Reuters. Xu’s symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties.\nHe was finally admitted on Jan. 22 to queue for the test at Hankou hospital in Wuhan after his daughter publicized his case on Weibo.\nResearchers at Lancaster University estimate that only 5.1% of infections in Wuhan have been identified. By Jan. 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. More than 30,000 people in Wuhan are under observation, according to the city’s health authorities.\n“All we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,” said a 33-year-old Wuhan woman surnamed Liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since Jan. 14 and was still untested on Monday. “At least if it’s confirmed we have a direction.

However, it comes right before the peak travel season during the Lunar New Year holidays, raising the risk that it could spread further.\n“There was a sharp fall in Hong Kong stock futures that rippled through the currency market and pushed up the yen,” said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.\n“I can understand why some people would say the Chinese virus is the trigger, but it is still too early to be certain.”\nThe yen edged higher 0.15% to 110.01 per dollar on Tuesday.\nIn the onshore market, the yuan fell to 6.8916 per dollar, the lowest level in almost a week. In the offshore market, it dropped to 6.8886.\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 97.598, near the highest level in a month.\nTraders in Japan were also focused on a Bank of Japan meeting.\nAt the two-day rate review that ends on Tuesday, the BOJ is set to keep its short-term interest rate target at minus 0.1% and a pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields around zero.\nThe BOJ is also expected to nudge up its growth forecasts as improved macroeconomic indicators take some pressure off the central bank for more stimulus, but traders will scrutinise governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s remarks after the policy decision.\nElsewhere in currencies, the Australian dollar fell 0.18% to $0.6862 as worries about the Chinese virus hurt currencies sensitive to risk. The New Zealand dollar also eased 0.11% to $0.6604.\nThe euro was locked in a narrow range before a European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday where it is expected to launch a comprehensive review of central bank strategy, including the ECB’s inflation target.\nAgainst the dollar, the euro traded at $1.1096. The common currency was also quoted at 85.34 pence.\nThe ECB’s first meeting of the year is most likely to launch a rethink of an inflation goal the bank has failed to meet since 2013.\nThe scope and scale of the review will be a key focus for markets given the far-reaching implications for monetary policy.\nA slightly brighter tone to data means the ECB’s assessment of the economic outlook will also be watched closely by investors on Thursday.

Foi uma autêntica odisseia o processo de repatriamento de 18 portugueses e duas cidadãs brasileiras que estiveram retidos durante vários dias na cidade de Wuhan, o epicentro do surto da nova estirpe de coronavírus. São, afinal, 20, incluindo dois diplomatas da embaixada portuguesa em Pequim, e todos aceitaram ficar em “isolamento profiláctico” e sem hipótese de visitas, mesmo controladas, ao longo de duas semanas no Hospital de Pulido Valente e em instalações do Parque da Saúde, em Lisboa, explicou a ministra da Saúde em conferência de imprensa na noite de domingo.\nTodos terão anuído, assegurou Marta Temido, uma vez que a lei portuguesa não prevê a quarentena obrigatória de pessoas não-doentes, ao contrário do que acontece noutros países. Além de 16 portugueses (e não 17, como inicialmente tinha sido anunciado), foram transferidas de Wuhan duas cidadãs brasileiras “que também estavam na China e acompanharam os nossos compatriotas”, além dos dois diplomatas portugueses, especificou a governante, ladeada por quatro secretários de Estado (Saúde, Negócios Estrangeiros, Defesa e Protecção Civil) e a directora-geral da Saúde.\nNo voo de 14 horas que os transportou de Wuhan até França, viajaram 250 cidadãos de três dezenas de países europeus e 20 ficaram retidos numa base militar francesa perto de Marselha por apresentarem sintomas de possível contágio. Os portugueses não estiveram em contacto com estes passageiros no enorme avião que os transportou, um Airbus A-380, mas, ainda assim, e por um princípio de precaução, ficarão neste isolamento voluntário nas instalações preparadas para os receber (13 quartos individuais no Pulido Valente e outros dez no Parque da Saúde). No Porto, está também a postos o Hospital Militar para receber os do Norte, mas tal não se afigura necessário, para já. “Este foi o último troço de uma longuíssima viagem”, enfatizou a secretária de Estado dos Negócios Estrangeiros, Teresa Ribeiro. \nAssegurando que houve “tranquilidade na abordagem da medida preventiva” que coloca os repatriados de Wuhan em isolamento, Marta Temido frisou que esta é uma medida “que está em linha com o que está a ser realizado por outros países\" e se fundamenta na “fase epidémica\" e de “contenção\" decretada a nível internacional. Aliás, recordou, os portugueses já “estavam habituados [ao isolamento] em território chinês”, onde passaram vários dias retidos em casa. Desta forma, acrescentou, podem ter também um melhor acompanhamento pelos serviços de saúde”. O isolamento deverá durar 14 dias (o período de incubação da doença até ao surgimento dos primeiros sintomas) e será efectuada “vigilância activa” por parte dos profissionais de saúde duas vezes por dia. \nNo momento em que estava ainda em curso um inquérito epidemiológico aos repatriados por uma equipa da Sanidade Internacional no Aeroporto de Figo Maduro, onde aterraram a bordo do C-130 da Força Aérea que os foi buscar a Marselha, a ministra explicou que, se fosse suscitada qualquer dúvida durante este processo, esta seria esclarecida através de contacto telefónico da linha de apoio ao médico da Direcção-Geral da Saúde (DGS). “A sua eventual validação médica determinará que o caso seja enviado seguindo o protocolo de transporte para um dos hospitais de referência”, especificou.\nNovos testes\nDepois de terem sido sujeitos a exames à saída da China, que se revelaram negativos, os 20 voltam a ser testados cá. No Pulido Valente serão feitas colheitas de material biológico que devem ser analisadas ainda na madrugada de segunda-feira no Instituto Nacional de Saúde Doutor Ricardo Jorge (Insa). Em poucas horas será possível perceber se algum deles está infectado.\nAo longo do isolamento, caso se suspeite de que algum deles esteja infectado pela revelação de vários sintomas, será transportado de imediato para o Curry Cabral, hospital de referência para os casos confirmados num eventual surto do novo coronavírus em Portugal (os outros são o S. João, no Porto, e o D. Estefânia também em Lisboa e destinado a crianças). Nos serviços de doenças infecciosas destes hospitais há quartos de pressão negativa (com sistemas de ventilação que não permitem que o ar escape), onde os casos suspeitos validados pela DGS ficam internados até chegarem os resultados das análises do Insa. Estes hospitais apenas internam casos suspeitos validados pela DGS e doentes.\nInstada a explicar por que razão um avião com passageiros chineses aterrou no sábado em Ponta Delgada, depois de lhe ter sido recusada a aterragem em outros países, a directora-geral da Saúde, Graça Freitas, sublinhou que nenhum deles vinha de Wuhan. E adiantou que foram as autoridades alfandegárias açorianas a contactar as autoridades de saúde, que efectuaram um inquérito epidemiológico e avaliaram a história clínica dos passageiros. Graça Freitas assegurou que nos aeroportos portugueses se está a efectuar o que é recomendado pelas autoridades de saúde internacionais e que “não há indicação para fazer rastreio à entrada”. \nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\nA China elevou este domingo para 304 mortos e mais de 14 mil infectados o balanço do surto de pneumonia provocado por um novo coronavírus que foi detectado em Dezembro passado, em Wuhan, capital da província de Hubei (no Centro do país).\nAs Filipinas anunciaram também este domingo a morte de um cidadão de nacionalidade chinesa, vítima de uma pneumonia causada pelo coronavírus, a primeira vítima fatal fora da China. Além do território continental da China e das regiões chinesas de Macau e Hong Kong, há mais casos de infecção confirmados em 24 outros países, com as mais recentes notificações na Rússia, Suécia e Espanha.\n"}, {"content": "China scrambles to curb rise in imported coronavirus cases, Wuhan eases lockdown. China reported 46 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, while the city of Wuhan, the pandemic's ground zero, announced it would be loosening a two-month lockdown by gradually resuming public transportation and allowing healthy people to resume work.\nIt was the fourth day in a row with an increase in Chinese cases, all but one of which was imported from overseas.\nBut in a sign of easing lockdown measures, residents living in and outside Wuhan will be allowed to travel into the city to resume work if they have a green health code issued by the government and normal body temperature, state-media CCTV News reported on Sunday. It cited the city's epidemic prevention and control command center.\nNon-local people stranded in Wuhan can also apply to leave the city after taking an RNA test and receiving a health certificate from the government, the channel said.\nDespite the relaxed measures for Wuhan and a reduced number of domestically transmitted cases - the one reported on Sunday was the first in four days - China is seeing a steady rise in imported cases, mostly Chinese people returning from overseas. That has led Beijing to further step up measures to intercept cases from abroad as the outbreak worsens globally.\nIn a sign of how seriously China is taking the threat of imported cases, all international flights due to arrive in Beijing starting Monday will first land at another airport, where passengers will undergo virus screening, government agencies said on Sunday, in an expansion of existing measures.\nInternational flights that were scheduled to arrive in the capital will land instead at one of 12 airports. Passengers who clear screening will then be permitted to reboard the plane, which will then fly to Beijing, the regulator said.\nSeparately, Shanghai and Guangzhou both announced that all arriving international passengers will undergo an RNA test to screen for coronavirus, expanding a program that previously only applied to those coming from heavily-hit countries.\nAmong the new cases from abroad reported on Sunday, a record 14 were in the financial hub of Shanghai and 13 were in Beijing, a decline from 21 the previous day.\nThe new locally transmitted case was in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou and was also the first known case where the infection of a local person was linked to the arrival of someone from overseas, according to Guangdong province.\nHu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the Global Times newspaper, called for all cities in China to implement 14-day quarantines for people arriving from abroad.\nHe also called for quarantine policies to apply to people from Hong Kong and Macau as well, he said on his Weibo account on Sunday.\n\"I am worried that there are similar cases to the Guangzhou one existing in other parts of the country. There were reports previously that people coming back from abroad returned to their homes in Shanghai without any obstacles,\" Hu said.\n\"It matters to the overall situation of China's next prevention and control efforts if we can plug the leaks.\"\nThe Global Times is a tabloid published by the Ruling Communist Party's People's Daily.\nThe latest figures from China's National Health Commission bring total reported coronavirus cases in the country to 81,054, with 3,261 deaths, including six on Saturday. On Saturday, China reported 41 new coronavirus cases for the previous day, all of them imported.\nOf all 97 imported cases as of end-Saturday, 92 of them are Chinese nationals and 51 are Chinese students returning from studying abroad, said Gao Xiaojun, spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Health Commission during a press conference on Sunday.\nThe Beijing health commission announced separately on its website it had two more imported cases on Sunday, bringing the city's total number of imported cases to 99 as of Sunday noon.\nBACK TO A KIND OF NORMAL\nChina is trying to revive an economy that is widely expected to contract deeply in the current quarter, with life slowly returning to normal in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, albeit with everyone wearing masks in public.\nStill, numerous shops and restaurants remain shut - many have gone out of business - and factories and other workplaces are still not operating at full capacity.\nOn Sunday, a central bank official called for stepped-up global policy coordination to manage the economic impact of the pandemic. He said China's recent policy measures were gaining traction, and it has capacity for further action.\nChen Yulu, a deputy governor at the People's Bank of China (PBOC), also said he expects significant improvement in the Chinese economy in the second quarter.\nAnd while the virus will continue putting upward pressure on near-term consumer prices, there is no basis for long-term inflation or deflation, he told a news briefing.\nGlobally, roughly 275,000 people have been infected with the virus, and more than 11,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally, with the number of deaths in Italy recently surpassing those in China.\n\"Now I think the epidemic has been controlled. But this definitely doesn't mean that it's over,\" said a 25-year-old woman surnamed He who works in the internet sector and was visiting the vast Summer Palace complex in Beijing on Saturday.\n\"I'm willing to come out today but of course I am still afraid,\" she told Reuters.\nThe central province of Hubei, where the outbreak first emerged late last year in its capital Wuhan, reported its fourth straight day of no new cases.\nChina has used draconian measures to contain the spread of the virus, including locking down Hubei province.\n"}, {"content": "Krankenhäuser laut Bundesärztekammer nicht gut vorbereitet. Die Bundesärztekammer hält die Krankenhäuser in Deutschland nicht für ausreichend auf das neuartige Coronavirus vorbreitet. Optimal für Patienten mit diesem Virus seien Einzelzimmer mit Vorschleusen, von denen es aber nicht mehr sehr viele gebe, sagte die Pandemiebeauftragte der Kammer, Susanne Johna, der Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung. Die Zahl dieser Zimmer sei im vergangenen Jahrzehnt aus Kostengründen reduziert worden.\nJohna sagte, dass bei dringendem Behandlungsbedarf sogenannte Einzelboxen auf Intensivstationen benötigt würden, um die Übertragungsgefahr zu minimieren. Auch davon gebe es aus Kostengründen zu wenige.\nDie Hygieneexpertin, die auch Vorsitzende der Ärztegewerkschaft Marburger Bund ist, bezeichnete das neue Virus aus China als Weckruf. Nicht nur bei der Krankenhausausstattung gebe es Nachholbedarf. Auch der öffentliche Gesundheitsdienst sei vielerorts \"massiv unterbesetzt\". Es mangele an Ärzten und Fachpersonal.\nJohna warnte jedoch vor Panik. Zwar müsse das neue Virus ernst genommen werden, \"weil wir noch lange nicht alles darüber wissen\". Eine aktuelle Bedrohung gebe es aber nicht. Die Gefahr durch eine normale Grippe sei viel höher. An Influenza seien in Deutschland in diesem Winter schon etwa 40 Menschen gestorben. Doch sei die Grippe bekannt \"und wird deswegen nicht so ernst genommen wie ein neuer Erreger mit vielen Unbekannten\".\nIn Deutschland war am Donnerstagabend ein fünfter Fall der Ansteckung mit dem neuen Virus bestätigt worden. Wie bei den anderen vier deutschen Fällen handelt es sich um einen Mitarbeiter des im oberbayerischen Starnberg angesiedelten Automobilzulieferers Webasto, wie das bayerische Gesundheitsministerium mitteilte.\nEnde 2019 meldeten die chinesischen Behörden der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO eine Häufung von Lungenentzündungen unklarer Ursache in der zentralchinesischen Stadt Wuhan. Bereits eine Woche später identifizierten chinesische Forscher ein neuartiges Virus als Ursache der Krankheitsfälle. Es gehört zur Gruppe der Coronaviren. Wenige Tage darauf veröffentlichte eine Gruppe um den Virologen Christian Drosten von der Berliner Charité den ersten diagnostischen Test für das neue Virus, das Forscher provisorisch 2019-nCoV nennen. Mit dem Test kann das Virus im Labor nachgewiesen werden. Als Quelle des Erregers vermuten die chinesischen Behörden einen Lebensmittelmarkt in Wuhan, auf dem neben Fisch und Meeresfrüchten auch exotische Tiere wie Schlangen verkauft wurden. Der Markt wurde geschlossen und desinfiziert.\nSowohl die Atemwegserkrankungen Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) als auch Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) werden von Coronaviren verursacht, die ihren Ursprung in Tieren haben. Während der Sars-Pandemie infizierten sich in den Jahren 2002 und 2003 etwa 8.000 Menschen, mehr als 750 starben. Mit dem Mers-Virus haben sich seit seiner Entdeckung 2012 bis zum Jahresende 2019 etwa 2.500 Menschen angesteckt, jeder Dritte ist daran gestorben. Insgesamt gibt es aber mehrere Hundert Arten von Coronaviren. Viele von ihnen betreffen die Atemwege und können zum Beispiel Erkältungen verursachen.\nIn China sind inzwischen mehrere Tausend Personen erkrankt, einige von ihnen – die meisten wohl mit Vorerkrankungen – sind an einer Lungenentzündung infolge des Virus gestorben. Die ersten Infektionsfälle außerhalb Chinas wurden in Thailand, Japan und Südkorea bekannt. Es handelt sich um Reisende, die vorher in Wuhan gewesen waren. Am 21. Januar meldeten US-Behörden die erste Infektion bei einem Touristen, der aus Wuhan zurückkam, am 24. Januar wurden die ersten Fälle in Frankreich bekannt. Mittlerweile wurden auch erste Fälle in Deutschland bestätigt. Typische Zeichen einer Infektion sind Fieber, Husten und Atembeschwerden. Das Virus kann eine Lungenentzündung verursachen, die tödlich enden kann. Da es sich um eine virale Krankheit handelt, helfen Antibiotika nicht.\nInzwischen ist klar, dass das Virus von Mensch zu Mensch übertragen werden kann. Chinesische Behörden haben mehrere solcher Übertragungen bestätigt, nachdem auch etwa ein Dutzend Fälle bei medizinischem Personal bekannt wurden. Medizinerinnen und Mediziner gehen davon aus, dass das Virus vor allem über Tröpfcheninfektion übertragen wird. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation rechnet, wie sie am 24. Januar mitteilte, momentan damit, dass ein Infizierter im Schnitt 1,4 bis 2,5 andere Menschen ansteckt. Bewahrheiten sich diese Zahlen, ist das Virus weniger ansteckend als Sars und auch die Virusgrippe. Die WHO empfiehlt generelle Hygieneregeln zu beachten: Man solle sich häufig die Hände waschen und engen Kontakt zu Personen mit Atemwegserkrankungen und wilden Tieren meiden.\nDas lässt sich noch nicht mit Sicherheit sagen. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation teilte am 28. Januar mit, dass ungefähr ein Fünftel der gemeldeten Fälle durch das Virus schwer krank werde, im Zweifelsfall also intensivmedizinisch behandelt werden muss. Berichten zufolge handelte es sich bei den ersten Todesopfern um Patienten, die teils schwere Vorerkrankungen hatten. Auch bei anderen Infektionskrankheiten sind Menschen mit Vorerkrankungen besonders gefährdet – etwa bei der Grippe. Coronaviren sind dafür bekannt, dass sie mutieren, also ihr Erbgut verändern können. Das kann dazu führen, dass sie im Laufe eines Ausbruchs gefährlicher für Menschen werden – aber auch zum genauen Gegenteil. Das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) erwartet zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt keine ähnlich hohe Mortalität wie beim Ausbruch von Sars.\nBundesgesundheitsminister Jens Spahn (CDU) betonte, dass Deutschland gut auf das Virus vorbereitet sei. In einem Interview mit dem Magazin Focus sagte er, die Bundesregierung habe Maßnahmen ergriffen, um Verdachtsfälle früh zu erkennen und damit die Ansteckungsgefahr zu minimieren. Spahn sagte, dass er die neuartige Atemwegserkrankung nicht für einen Notstand in Deutschland halte: \"Wir sind sehr wachsam. Aber gelassen.\"\nIn China stiegen Infektionen und Todesfälle durch das Coronavirus weiter an. Die Zahl der Patienten wuchs um 1.981 auf nun 9.692, wie die Gesundheitskommission in Peking berichtete. Die Zahl der Toten stieg um 42 auf 213. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) hatte zuvor die Ausbreitung des Virus zu einer \"gesundheitlichen Notlage von internationaler Tragweite\" erklärt. Die 190 Mitgliedsländer werden damit von der WHO empfohlene Krisenmaßnahmen untereinander koordinieren.\nWegen des Virus erließ das US-Außenministerium eine Reisewarnung für ganz China. Das Auswärtige Amt in Berlin warnte zunächst vor Reisen in die am stärksten betroffene Provinz Hubei, empfahl aber in einer Teilreisewarnung, nicht notwendige Reisen nach China \"nach Möglichkeit\" zu verschieben.\n"}, {"content": "Second plane of evacuees from China lands in France. “There are many Europeans, 29 different nationalities, 30 with French nationality,” said Jean-Yves le Drian, France's minister of foreign affairs.\n“We have assumed our responsibility in the sharing and solidarity with Europeans.

A Comissão Europeia ativou esta terça-feira Mecanismo Europeu de Protecção Civil face ao surto de coronavírus que já matou mais de 100 pessoas na China e qualquer Estado-membro pode beneficiar disso mas o Governo português continua sem anunciar se pretende fazê-lo, apesar dos pedidos dos residentes portugueses em Wuhan, epicentro da epidemia do novo vírus, para serem retirados o “mais rápido possível” do país. Questionado pelo Expresso várias vezes, o Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros não esclareceu se vai ou não ativar o mecanismo europeu.\nFrança, pelo contrário, já anunciou que vai recorrer a este mecanismo para retirar os seus cidadãos da China — foi a pedido deste país, aliás, que aquele foi ativado. “À medida que o surto se intensifica, o Mecanismo Europeu de Proteção Civil foi ativado após um pedido da França”, informou o serviço de Ajuda Humanitária da Comissão Europeia numa publicação feita no Twitter, acrescentando que vão ser enviados dois aviões, entre quarta-feira e sexta-feira, para Wuhan, de forma a transportar de volta para os seus países 250 franceses e outros 100 cidadãos europeus cujos países assim o solicitem, “independentemente da nacionalidade”. O mecanismo é utilizado em catástrofes naturais e outras situações urgentes e a sua ativação permite aos países europeus terem apoio logístico e financeiro por parte da União Europeia. Já foi ativado em inúmeras ocasiões, nomeadamente no contexto do sismo de 2010 no Haiti, na crise de refugiados na Grécia, em 2016, e, mais recentemente, durante os incêndios florestais que devastaram o Chile em 2017.\nEmbora se saiba que Portugal equacionou seguir o exemplo de França, nenhuma decisão foi tomada ainda e aos cerca de 20 portugueses que vivem em Wuhan foi dito apenas, em comunicado enviado pela embaixada de Portugal em Pequim para os seus endereços de e-mail, que foram iniciados “todos os passos” para proceder à sua retirada por via aérea (chegou a ser estudada a possibilidade de retirá-los por terra para Xangai, no leste da China, e daí para Portugal, mas sem efeitos concretos), recorrendo para isso a “um avião civil fretado que irá aterrar na cidade e dali seguirá diretamente para Portugal”. Segundo a embaixada, “é este o plano que está a ser equacionado em Lisboa”, tendo começado já a ser pedidas “as devidas autorizações” a Pequim para avançar com a retirada dos cidadãos portugueses.\nVários desses portugueses disseram ao Expresso não ter qualquer informação sobre a data de saída nem sobre o transporte para Portugal e o que é suposto acontecer à chegada — para onde serão levados, se para casa, se para o hospital, para fazer exames, se assim se considerar necessário. À agência Lusa e, posteriormente, a outros meios de comunicação, Graça Freitas, diretora-geral da Saúde, afirmou que os portugueses residentes em Wuhan “virão para Portugal como qualquer outro passageiro assintomático”.\nÀ chegada a Portugal, “e como vêm do epicentro da doença”, será feita uma “pequena história clínica, isto é, um inquérito epidemiológico, para perceber se estiveram em contacto com doentes” infetados com o novo coronavírus ou se estiveram em contacto com animais. Dependendo do “risco inicial, a vigilância pode ser passiva ou ativa”. “Podem ser enviados para casa, podemos pedir para serem isolados nos quartos e também podemos ligar várias vezes por dia. Se percebemos que nos últimos 14 dias não saíram praticamente de casa, não tiveram contacto com doentes e animais vivos, há um risco baixíssimo e ficam submetidos a medidas de vigilância muito baixas”, esclareceu a diretora-geral, comparando o acompanhamento ao realizado com outros doentes. “Primeiro faz-se o diagnóstico e depois um plano terapêutico.”\nSe, depois disso, houver sintomas, os cidadãos portugueses devem contactar as autoridades de saúde recomendadas pela DGS e indicar se tiveram contacto com outras pessoas, podendo ser aconselhados, nesse caso, a que não saiam de casa. Graça Freitas explicou ainda que haverá “protocolos de saúde diferentes” se os residentes portugueses em Wuhan “estiverem doentes já na cidade chinesa ou exibirem sintomas a bordo”. “Podem embarcar lá sem sinais, nem sintomas e desenvolver os sinais e sintomas a bordo. Também há um protocolo para isso”, afirmou, esclarecendo que caberá ao comandante do avião alertar as autoridades portuguesas para isso.\nDe acordo com o mais recente balanço das autoridades chinesas, morreram já 106 pessoas devido ao surto de coronavírus e mais de 4.000 encontram-se infectadas. A região de Wuhan, onde foi detectado o primeiro caso, foi colocada em quarentena mas isso não isolou o problema. Além do território continental da China, foram reportados casos de infeção em Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tailândia, Japão, Coreia do Sul, Estados Unidos, Singapura, Vietname, Nepal, Malásia, França, Alemanha (onde foram confirmados três novos casos entretanto), Austrália e Canadá.\n"}, {"content": "China desenvolve vacina, mas ainda não foi testada.

In the first flight on Saturday, 324 Indians were evacuated and on Sunday another 323 Indians and seven Maldivian citizens were flown back.\nThe e-visa facility for Chinese nationals was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to China in 2015 as a confidence building measure as well as an attempt to ease visa restrictions to attract more Chinese tourists.\nWith the spread of the coronavirus, a number of countries have temporarily stopped issuing visas to Chinese nationals and have imposed travel ban on visitors from China.\nThe United States has imposed a 14-day travel ban on all visitors from China, regardless of their nationality.\nUS citizens arriving from Hube province will have to undergo 14-day mandatory quarantine on arrival, while those traveling any other part of China will face screening and monitoring.\nSingapore has stopped issuing all types of visas to Chinese travellers, while Vietnam has halted tourist visas.\nRussia announced Saturday it would halt visa-free tourism for Chinese nationals and also stop issuing them work visas. It had already stopped issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals. Similar visa restrictions have been imposed by the Philippines, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and the African nation of Mozambique.\nThe virus that emerged in early December and traced to a market in Hubei capital Wuhan that sold wild animals, has now spread to 25 countries, including India where two cases have been confirmed in Kerala.\nThe Philippines on Sunday reported the first death outside China from the deadly virus.\n"}, {"content": "India reports second coronavirus case from Kerala.

The patient had returned to Kerala on January 24, the state government said.\nThe country's first novel coronavirus case was reported from Thrissur in Kerala on Thursday with a woman medical student who returned from Wuhan testing positive for the infection.\nConfirming the second case, Kerala health minister K K Shailaja said the condition of the student, currently admitted to the isolation ward at the Alapuzha Medical College Hospital, was \"stable\".\nEarlier in the day, the minister said in Kollam that the state was awaiting the results of tests conducted on the patient from the National Institute of Virology in Pune.\n\"Now, we have got the test report of the patient. There is a positive case in Alapuzha,\" she told reporters here on Sunday evening after chairing a high-level meeting with senior health department officials.\nThe first patient, a woman medical student, is in an isolation ward at the Thrissur medical college hospital.\n\"We are trying to ensure that the virus does not spread. The two patients, who have tested positive for the virus, are stable. Their condition is not serious. But we are monitoring them closely,\" she said.\nSince the coronavirus outbreak in China, Kerala, which is thickly populated, has been on high alert as a large number of students from the state are studying in the University of Wuhan.\nThe Kerala health minister said they had started the process to identify people who may have come in contact the two virus-infected patients.\nShe said police were helping in the process.\nWith the second case being reported from the state, people need to be more vigilant and follow all precautionary measures, Shailaja said.\nA meeting with officials of private hospitals in Thrissur was held and they have kept aside around 87 beds for isolation wards.\nA similar exercise was required to be undertaken here in view of the need to arrange maximum number of beds (to meet contingencies), she said.\nShe said those who have returned from the virus-affected areas of China, besides Sri Lanka and Nepal, must inform the health department as they will have to be home quarantined for 28 days.\n\"We would like to keep them under quarantine for double the duration of incubation period of the virus. We have followed the same protocol earlier during the Nipah, chikungunya and H1N1 outbreak\".\nThose under observation at home should keep away from public functions and should not participate in any events during the incubation period.\nTill date, a total of 1,793 people, who travelled from coronavirus-affected countries, have been identified and placed under surveillance in the state.\nOf this, as many as 70 have been admitted to isolation facilities and others are under home isolation, a medical bulletin had said on Saturday.\n"}, {"content": "Escaping the coronavirus. As the coronavirus spreads across China, it has been a dash\nto get back to South Africa — and safety — for many locals who have been living\nand working in the country for many years.\nFor Pietermaritzburg sisters Mriska (29) and 21-year-old\nMischa Singh, both University of KwaZulu-Natal graduates who have been teaching\nEnglish there, the trip back home was not an easy path.\nGlad that they are finally home, Mriska, who was teaching\nEnglish in Beijing, said when they first found out about the virus and its\neffects, in the middle of January, it was not taken as a serious issue.\n“Everyone just thought it was something that would blow over\nand we were too far away to be directly affected. But as the virus spread, the\ngovernment clamped down on everything and the city became a ghost town,” she\nsaid.\nOvernight the Chinese capital, like other cities across the\ncountry, became deserted after imposing restrictions and shut down public\nspaces.\nAlthough Beijing is not under a strict government-ordered\nlockdown, like in Wuhan — which is the “epicentre” of the virus outbreak — it\nhas, however, imposed restrictions on every aspect of life since declaring the\nhighest level of public health emergency on January 24.\nThis shutdown across most of China has caused the country\nand, to an extent, its economy to grind to a halt.\n“We were fine for about a week after the restrictions were\nimposed and then we started seeing the impact of it. We were not allowed out of\nour apartments. In any case we did not want to leave for fear of becoming\ninfected.\n“Each person entering or leaving the apartment had to\nprovide details of where they were going to and who they have been in contact\nwith. Most of the businesses, schools, shops and everything else is closed.\n“Water was the first commodity to run out as stocks are not\nbeing replenished and then it was food items,” said Mriska.\nFor the Chinese, the December and January period is heralded\nas the Spring Festival and many use that time to splurge on travel and\nvacations.\nMischa, who lives and teaches in Yanjaio in the Hebei\nprovince, just outside Beijing, was at Disneyland in Shanghai and woke up to\novernight news that the city was on lockdown as a result of the virus.\n“I just packed my bags and headed for the airport. I didn’t\nwant to be stranded in a hotel in Shanghai. The airport was an absolute mess\nbut I eventually managed to get a flight to Beijing, where I spent a few days\nwith my sister before heading back,” said Mischa.\nBut that was nothing compared to what she would find when\nshe returned to Yanjaio and then tried to leave there again.\n“When I got back, it was already a ghost town. There was not\na soul to be seen. We couldn’t even get masks. Because it is a smaller village,\npeople were very scared. Soon there was no food and water,” said Mischa.\nAt the same time, the sisters were arranging to return to South\nAfrica.\n“We couldn’t go to work as everything was shut down and we\nwere also growing scared that if we delayed we would not be able to leave as\nmost airlines were clamping down on their flights out of China,” said Mriska.\nWhen they eventually made their arrangements, it was another\nbattle to get Mischa from Yanjaio to Beijing.\n“The subways were not running and neither were there any\ntaxis available as people were not taking chances and coming out of their\nhomes. I had to call a Chinese friend, who knew another person who drove a\ntaxi, and after three attempts got a taxi to come to Beijing. I just had to try\nanyway I could to get to Beijing to my sister so we could fly out,” said\nMischa.\n“I eventually managed to get a taxi but the journey to\nBeijing was long and difficult. It’s normally a 45-minute trip for the 36 km,\nbut the border posts were busy and the authorities had to stop each car and\ncheck on each person.\n“Every person had to have their temperatures checked and\nsign forms indicating where they were from and where they were going to.”\nAt the same time, as news of the deaths from the virus\nspread, fear-mongering grew. “My Chinese friend returned from vacation to find\nshe had nowhere to live. Her flatmates had changed the password on the access\nsystem and locked her out as she had been travelling and they were not prepared\nto take the risk,” said Mriska.\nEventually leaving China on February 3, the sisters flew to\nDubai and then arrived in South Africa on February 7.\n“We booked our flights and kept monitoring to see that it\nwasn’t cancelled as most airlines were cancelling their flights. We were lucky.\n“We arrived at the airport six hours ahead of our flight to\nmake sure everything would run smoothly only to find horrendous queues and\nthousands of people from all over the world also trying to get out of China\nwhile they could.\n“Everyone was wearing masks, and even on the flights we had\nto keep it on,” said Mischa.\nLanding with masks on in Dubai, she said, was pretty\nawkward, as other travellers distanced themselves from them and gave them\nstrange looks because it was evident they were from China because of the masks.\n“At Dubai and in South Africa, upon landing we were\nsubjected to temperature checks and had to fill in forms advising where we had\nbeen travelling from and if we were ill,” said Mischa.\nGlad that they are back home, the sisters said they were thankful\nto be away from the outbreak.\n“We have work commitments and will have to go back once all\nof this is over. But we are just glad to be home, to have drinking water and\nfood, fresh air and be safe,” said Mriska.\nTheir parents, Kamal and Jasmin Singh, were due to fly to\nChina on February 7 to visit their daughters but had to cancel their trip as\nwell.\n“We were stressed out and encouraged the girls to come home.\nWe are just glad that they got here in time and that they are safe,” said\nJasmin.\n‘Suffering and sadness around’\nVeteran KZN journalist Martin Challenor, who lives in\nYinzhou District, Ningbo, with his wife Kathy, said on Facebook that they\nventured out of their apartment on their ebikes only to buy food.\nHe said all non-essential businesses, bars, restaurants and\nsome malls had closed.\n“The medical authorities keep us updated on the virus\nthrough WeChat. The day starts in a macabre way — checking the statistics about\nthe virus. There are as of now [Tuesday] 1 017 deaths and 42 714 confirmed\ncases.\n“The statistics are updated far too often for my liking.\nThere are cellphone apps that tell me there were 13 cases in my suburb, the\nclosest being 707 metres away from me right now.\n“I do not like being confined to my flat. One person can go\nout to shop every second day. People returning to China and their homes from\nother cities are subjected to 14 days quarantine. These measures are needed\nbecause the virus spreads so easily and because a person can spread the virus\nfor 14 days after catching it and before falling ill themselves. I am growing\nweaker through inactivity. There is so much suffering and sadness around me,”\nreads his post.\nRecommended safety measures\nAlthough there are no reported cases of the coronavirus in\nSouth Africa, practising recommended measures advised by the World Health\nOrganisation will help in the long-term.\n• Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an\nalcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty.\nWhy? Washing your hands with soap and water or using\nalcohol-based hand rub eliminates the virus if it is on your hands.\n• Practice respiratory hygiene\nWhen coughing and sneezing, cover mouth and nose with flexed\nelbow or tissue — discard tissue immediately into a closed bin and clean your\nhands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.\nWhy? Covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing\nprevent the spread of germs and viruses. If you sneeze or cough into your\nhands, you may contaminate objects or people that you touch.\n• Maintain social distancing\nMaintain at least a one-metre distance between yourself and\nother people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever.\nWhy? When someone who is infected with a respiratory disease\nlike 2019-nCoV coughs or sneezes, they project small droplets containing the\nvirus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the virus.\n• Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth\nWhy? Hands touch many surfaces which can be contaminated\nwith the virus. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your contaminated\nhands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself.\n• If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek\nmedical care early\nTell your health care provider if you have travelled in an\narea in China where 2019-nCoV has been reported, or if you have been in close\ncontact with someone who has travelled from China and has respiratory symptoms.\nWhy? Whenever you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing\nit is important to seek medical attention promptly as this may be due to a\nrespiratory infection or other serious condition. Respiratory symptoms with\nfever can have a range of causes, and depending on your personal travel history\nand circumstances, 2019-nCoV could be one of them.\n• If you have mild respiratory symptoms and no travel\nhistory to or within China, carefully practice basic respiratory and hand\nhygiene and stay home until you are recovered, if possible.\n• As a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures\nwhen visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets.\nEnsure regular hand washing with soap and potable water\nafter touching animals and animal products; avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth\nwith hands; and avoid contact with sick animals or spoiled animal products.\nStrictly avoid any contact with other animals in the market (e.g., stray cats\nand dogs, rodents, birds, bats).\nAvoid contact with potentially contaminated animal waste or\nfluids on the soil or structures of shops and market facilities.\n• Avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products\nHandle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care, to avoid\ncross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices.\n— World Health Organisation.\n\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus outbreak: Delhi govt sets up isolation wards in 25 hospitals, schools send advisories to parents.

BEIJING, Jan 30 -- The seafood market in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, may not be the only source of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, Xinhua news agency reported a Chinese pulmonary disease specialist as saying.Huang Chaolin, vice director of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, revealed in a recent interview with business magazine Caixin that there might be multiple places where the virus was first transmitted to humans.Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital is one of the city's designated hospitals to admit patients infected with the new virus. Huang and his team have recently published a paper in the Lancet, the world's leading general medical journal, about some early findings on the clinical data of the first 41 novel coronavirus cases.The first patient, who was admitted to Huang's hospital on Dec 1, 2019, had no direct exposure to Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which was previously considered as the source of the epidemic, and his family had no fever or respiratory symptoms, according to the paper.Among the following three patients who were admitted on Dec. 10, two had no exposure to the seafood market. In total, only 27 of the 41 cases had exposure to the marketplace, said the paper.\"Judging from the whole situation, the seafood market may not be the only source. (The origin of the novel coronavirus) might be multi-source,\" Huang said.But no clues about other sources have been discovered.The Huanan seafood market is located in the downtown area of the city's Jianghan District, less than one kilometre away from Hankou railway station. Besides seafood, poultry and game meat were also sold in the market before it was shut down on Jan 1.Experts of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention have previously isolated the novel coronavirus successfully in the environmental samples collected from the market.

(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n* GRAPHIC: ICE Newcastle coal vs. SGX Indonesia coal: reut.rs/3bmYOzG\nBy Clyde Russell\nLAUNCESTON, Australia, March 26 (Reuters) - Asia’s seaborne coal market is increasingly diverging between higher-quality Australian coal, where prices are holding up despite the economic shock being caused by the coronavirus, and lower-quality Indonesian fuel, which is losing ground.\nThe price of Australian benchmark Newcastle thermal coal futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange ended at $66.35 a tonne on Wednesday, down slightly from the prior day but up from the low so far this year of $65.15 on March 9.\nThe contract, which covers coal with an energy value of 6,000 kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg), has traded in a fairly narrow band so far this year, and at the close on Wednesday was only 2% weaker than at the end of last year.\nThis is despite the massive disruption caused to the economy of China, the world’s biggest coal importer, in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus from its origin in the city of Wuhan.\nWhile China has largely contained the virus, it has now spread across the globe, leading to increasingly strong isolation measures in many countries, with the concomitant economic fallout.\nHowever, futures for Indonesian coal with an energy rating of 4,200 kcal/kg traded in Singapore ended at $32.61 a tonne on Wednesday, the lowest price this year.\nThe contract is down 10.7% from its peak so far in 2020 of $36.51 a tonne on Feb. 10, and is also 4% softer than its close at the end of last year.\nWhat lies behind the divergence of the two main types of seaborne coal in Asia?\nThe most likely explanation is the current coronavirus crisis is changing market dynamics, rather than any structural change in supply or demand.\nIndonesia’s coal exports have been in a range around 30 million tonnes in recent months, with China and India accounting for about 60% of the total.\nAt the start of the year, both markets were performing well, with China actually importing more coal during its coronavirus lockdown, due to the impact on domestic mines and transport infrastructure.\nIndia’s imports from Indonesia were also resilient in the first two months of the year as coastal power plants increased generation, but they appear to be tapering off this month.\nIn the first 25 days of March just 4.04 million tonnes of Indonesian coal was discharged at Indian ports, according to vessel-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv.\nWhile that figure will rise by the end of month as more cargoes are unloaded, it looks certain that March’s total will be below February’s 7.96 million tonnes and January’s 7.42 million.\nIndia has lagged the rest of Asia in being hit by the coronavirus, but the country is now taking strong lockdown measures to prevent its spread, which will curb demand for electricity to power industry.\nCoal stocks at power plants and mines have also been rising, with the Business Standard newspaper reporting on March 24 that inventories were above 100 million tonnes, with stocks at plants reaching a record 41.4 million tonnes.\nPlentiful stocks combined with a sharp slowdown in economic activity mean India’s coal imports are likely to slip in coming months, especially from Indonesia.\nAustralia supplies virtually no thermal coal to India, which generally takes Indonesian coal because of its lower cost and cheaper freight rates. Australia’s trade with India is largely in coking coal used in steel-making.\nThe main markets for Australian thermal coal are China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, and Refinitiv data shows these markets have been resilient so far this year.\nTogether these four markets imported 26.8 million tonnes of both thermal and coking coal from Australia in January, the most since July last year, while February’s total was 21.22 million, up from 20.1 million in the same month last year.\nWith the coronavirus outbreak seemingly contained in China and Taiwan, and progress being made in Japan and South Korea, it’s possible that their imports of coal will hold up in coming months, with the main risk being the economic downturn in the rest of the world.\nAssuming no shock to supply should mines be forced to close in Australia to combat the coronavirus, there is a case that prices shouldn’t decline too much, but it would be difficult to make a bullish case until the world economy is showing signs of recovery.\nWith far greater exposure to India, Indonesian coal prices are more under threat, and will remain so until it’s clear that the world’s second-biggest importer of coal has beaten the coronavirus.

BEIJING: A new virus that has killed nine people, infected hundreds and reached the United States could mutate and spread, China warned on Wednesday (Jan 22), as authorities urged people to steer clear of the city at the heart of the outbreak. \n The coronavirus has caused alarm due to its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n With hundreds of millions of people travelling across China this week for the Chinese New Year holiday, the National Health Commission announced measures to contain the disease - including sterilisation and ventilation at airports and bus stations, as well as inside planes and trains. \n  \n In Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, authorities cancelled large public events, called on visitors to stay away and urged residents not to leave the central Chinese city of 11 million people. \n The illness is mainly transmitted via the respiratory tract and there \"is the possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease\", health commission vice minister Li Bin told a news conference in Beijing. \n The virus has now infected at least 440 people across the country, with most cases in Wuhan. Li added that 1,394 people are still under medical observation. \n The World Health Organization (WHO) will hold an emergency meeting Wednesday to determine whether to declare a rare global public health emergency over the disease, which has now been detected in the United States, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Macau. \n The first case in the United States - a Seattle resident in his 30s - is in good condition, American officials said. \n The Chinese government has classified the outbreak in the same category as the SARS epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement quarantine measures. \n  \n But they still have not been able to confirm the exact source of the virus, which has infected at least 440 people across the country. \n \"We will step up research efforts to identify the source and transmission of the disease,\" Li said, although he said experts believe \"the cases are mostly linked to Wuhan\". \n  \n Countries have been intensifying efforts to stop the spread of the pathogen - known by its technical name 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) - as the number of cases jumped. \n Plane passengers are facing screening measures at five US airports and a host of transport hubs across Asia. \n North Korea will ban foreign tourists entirely to protect itself against the virus, according to a major tour operator. \n VIRUS SOURCE \n A prominent expert from China's National Health Commission confirmed this week that the virus can be passed between people. \n  \n However, animals are suspected to be the primary source of the outbreak. \n A price list circulating online in China for a business at the Wuhan market lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies and rats. It also offered civets, the animal linked to SARS. \n \"We already know that the disease originated from a market which conducted illegal transaction of wild animals,\" said Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention. \n He said it was clear \"this virus is adapting and mutating\". \n Hong Kong and British scientists have estimated that between 1,300 and 1,700 people in Wuhan may have been infected. \n CONTAINMENT \n Health authorities are urging people to wash their hands regularly, avoid crowded places, get plenty of fresh air, and wear a mask if they have a cough. \n Anyone with a cough or fever was urged to go to hospital. \n Surgical masks and antibacterial products were starting to sell out on some popular online sites and pharmacies. \n  \n \"These days, I wear masks even in places that are not too crowded, although I wouldn't have done so in the past,\" said Wang Suping, 50, who works at a Beijing arts school. \n At the capital's main international airport, the majority of people were wearing masks. \n Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Airlines said they agreed to allow staff to wear surgical masks on mainland China flights, adding they would offer masks and antiseptic wipes to passengers travelling from Wuhan to the city. \n In Wuhan, police were conducting vehicle spot checks for live poultry or wild animals leaving and entering the city, state media said. Officials also screened people on roads, the airport and the train station for fevers. \n \"If it's not necessary we suggest that people don't come to Wuhan,\" Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV. \n The local government has cancelled major public activities and banned tour groups from heading out of the city. \n Women's football qualifiers for the Tokyo Olympic Games that were supposed to be held in Wuhan between Feb 3-9 were moved to the eastern city of Nanjing. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram \n "}, {"content": "Es gibt Ängste – und es gibt Rassismus. Franka Lu ist eine chinesische Journalistin und Unternehmerin. Sie arbeitet in China und Deutschland. In dieser ZEIT-ONLINE-Serie berichtet sie kritisch über Leben, Kultur und Alltag in China. Um ihr berufliches und privates Umfeld zu schützen, schreibt sie unter einem Pseudonym.\nDie Coronavirus-Epidemie ist eine Prüfung der menschlichen Zurechnungsfähigkeit. Am Berliner S-Bahnhof Beusselstraße ist eine chinesische Studentin von zwei Frauen beschimpft und getreten worden. In Toronto wurde eine alte Dame aus Hongkong in einem Supermarkt beleidigt. In Frankreich titelte die Zeitung Courrier picard hetzerisch \"Alerte jaune\" (\"Alarmstufe gelb\") und \"Le péril jaune?\" (\"Gelbe Gefahr?\"), dazu wurde das Bild einer Chinesin mit Schutzmaske gezeigt (die Zeitung hat sich mittlerweile für ihre Wortwahl bei Leserinnen und Lesern entschuldigt). Die Covergestaltung der jüngsten Ausgabe des Spiegel über das Virus – \"Made in China\" – sorgte für Empörung, auch wenn die Titelgeschichte inhaltlich in eine andere Richtung geht. Menschen mit chinesischen Wurzeln erleben in Deutschland auch direkt Anfeindungen. Weltweit erinnern uns Zwischenfälle, die sich gegen asiatisch aussehende Menschen richten, an eine alte Lektion: Angst und Unwissenheit können Menschen über Nacht feindselig werden lassen gegenüber anderen, die sie einer bestimmten Gruppe, Ethnie, Nation zugehörig betrachten.\nSeuchen entzweien uns Menschen. Albert Camus erzählt davon in Die Pest, José Saramago in Die Stadt der Blinden. Das ist nichts Neues, es wird gewiss auch in der Zukunft wieder passieren, überall, wo Menschen leben. Je mehr man sich von einer Katastrophe bedroht wähnt, desto stärker werden Angst und Dummheit das menschliche Verhalten bestimmen und zu Gewalt und Grausamkeiten führen. Man kann die wiedererwachende Feindseligkeit gegen Chinesinnen und Chinesen Rassismus nennen, aber das Phänomen ist nicht auf den Westen beschränkt. In China leiden Menschen, die aus dem Ausbruchsgebiet der Krankheit um Wuhan stammen, in anderen Landesteilen unter Feindseligkeiten. Sie werden beleidigt oder gar körperlich angegriffen.\nAls in Deutschland lebende Chinesin erzürnen mich weniger die erwartbaren menschlichen Unmenschlichkeiten im Kleinen, mich erzürnen deren Profiteure im Großen. Wie viele andere Chinesinnen und Chinesen in Deutschland habe ich hier viel Respekt und Gastfreundschaft erfahren. Recht, Gesetz und gesellschaftliche Normen sind in Deutschland so fein auf die Vermeidung von Rassismus gerichtet, dass ich, sobald ich mich daran gewöhnt hatte, geschockt war, wie viel Toleranz man andererseits etwa in den USA für die Äußerungen von Neonazis aufbringt. Ich habe auch rassistische Ausfälle erlebt, sie aber nie für symptomatisch gehalten. Sondern für das Verhalten von Menschen, die sich in Nöten glauben (oder es sogar sind) und ein Ventil suchen.\nStehen wir jetzt, in Zeiten der Epidemie, vor der Gefahr eines globalen Wiederauflebens eines antichinesischen Rassismus, vor dem viele wachsame Beobachter warnen? Ich bin mir noch nicht sicher. Wahr ist, dass es nie falsch sein kann, eine gefährliche gesellschaftliche Entwicklung auszubremsen, bevor es zu spät ist. Aber in der Frage, wie man das am wirksamsten tut, besonders in einer Zeit, in der viele Gesellschaften schon tief gespalten scheinen, habe ich womöglich eine abweichende Meinung.\nAuf der individuellen Ebene finde ich antirassistische Slogans wie \"Chinesen sind kein Virus!\" oder \"Sei kein Rassist!\" wenig hilfreich. Es gibt Menschen, die sind Rassisten bis ins Mark. Rassisten werden immer einen Vorwand finden, andere zu attackieren. Rassisten muss man bekämpfen. Aber eine Pariser Verkäuferin zu schelten, weil sie angesichts chinesischer Touristen nervös wird, oder einen deutschen Angestellten, der plötzlich nicht mehr mit seinem chinesischen Kollegen im Besprechungszimmer sitzen mag, kommt mir übertrieben vor. Der bessere Weg, den Menschen ihre Ängste zu nehmen und solche Zusammenstöße zu vermeiden, sind solide Informationen über potenzielle Ansteckungswege, Risiken und Maßnahmen, mit denen man sich selbst schützen kann. Es ist viel besser, den Menschen zu zeigen, dass sie gegen die Ansteckungsgefahr etwas tun können, statt sie wegen ihrer Ängste zu beschämen.\nAuf politischer und gesellschaftlicher Ebene sieht die Sache anders aus. Würde die Verbreitung des Coronavirus zur wirklich weltweiten Pandemie, könnte das zu Tribalismus in übelster Form führen, besonders in einer Zeit, in der sie sich von rechten Populisten – etwa von Donald Trump, dem Brexit-Lager, europäischen Rechtsradikalen – politisch ausnutzen lässt. Rassismus ist nichts anderes als eine der vielen Ausformungen des Tribalismus. Durch reißerische Überschriften kann man ihn anheizen, auch wenn die Redakteure des Courrier picard oder des Spiegel mutmaßlich nicht auf der falschen Seite stehen wollen.\nDie Anziehungskraft des Nationalismus ist noch immer stark. Im Vergleich zu anderen Ländern erlebe ich in Deutschland innenpolitisch große Wachsamkeit gegenüber nationalistischen Narrativen. Doch dass sie anderswo ebenfalls existieren, aber noch erfolgreicher politisch benutzt werden, dessen muss man sich auch in Deutschland stärker bewusst werden.\nIn China hat die Regierung den Menschen lange beigebracht, die Kommunistische Partei, das Land und die Bevölkerung als eine Einheit zu betrachten. Das ist ein effektiver Weg, sich der Loyalität aller Bürgerinnen und Bürger zu versichern und ihnen ein falsches Zugehörigkeits- und Heimatgefühl zu geben. Deshalb fühlen sich viele Auslandschinesen persönlich angegriffen, wenn sie hören, wie Nichtchinesen die Kommunistische Partei Chinas oder die dortige Regierung kritisieren. Sie haben gelernt, sich mit Partei und Staat völlig zu identifizieren. Leider machen viele Deutsche, deutsche Medien und sogar die deutsche Politik gelegentlich denselben Fehler und verwechseln die Menschen in China mit ihrer Regierung.\nEs gibt Fakten, über die in den europäischen Medien noch immer zu wenig berichtet wird. Das neue Coronavirus ist nicht \"Made in China\", genauso wenig wie Ebola \"Made in Africa\" ist. Diese Viren wurden nicht mit Absicht hergestellt, wie man Produkte fertigt, auf die man die Herkunftsbezeichnung \"Made in\" druckt. Aber das arrogante und autoritäre System in China hat die Verbreitung der Seuche anfänglich durch Nichthandeln ermöglicht. Viele Chinesinnen und Chinesen, besonders in der Region um Wuhan, erkennen langsam, dass man sie sehenden Auges in eine Krisensituation hat laufen lassen: Der Ernst der Lage und die Gefahren wurden vertuscht. Andere Chinesinnen und Chinesen halten noch immer an ihrem Glauben an die angeblich omnipotente Regierung fest, weil sie der einzige Halt ist, den sie kennen.\nDie Krise in China hat viele Facetten. Es herrscht ein Mangel an Transparenz; die Regierung und die Behörden lassen sich für ihr Handeln oder Nichthandeln faktisch nicht zur Verantwortung ziehen; das staatliche Gesundheitssystem ist schwach; es besteht keine Meinungsfreiheit im Land. Viele Chinesinnen und Chinesen riskieren ihr Leben (und ihre Freiheit), um das Virus zu besiegen und die Hindernisse zu umgehen, die das autoritäre System ihnen dabei in den Weg legt. Wenn die Welt von ihren Leistungen wüsste und sie anerkennen könnte, dürfte es anderswo keine antichinesischen Tendenzen mehr geben.\nSolange die Menschen außerhalb Chinas aber kein klares Bild davon haben, werden sie den Ausbruch des Coronavirus nur als einen bedrohlichen Ausnahmezustand sehen, der seinen Ursprung in \"China\" hat, einem Land, von dem sie nur eine vage Vorstellung besitzen. \"China\" ist schuld! Diese vage Vorstellung von \"China\" ist schon in sich eine Form von Tribalismus, weil sie von Stereotypen gespeist wird und nicht aus der Anschauung eines Landes und seiner Bewohnerinnen und Bewohner, den Existenzen und Leistungen von Individuen. Von Menschen, die gegen die Arroganz der Macht kämpfen, die über sie herrscht; die Wahrheit suchen und verbreiten wollen; die sich einer Krise mit großer Tapferkeit und intellektueller Scharfsicht stellen; die aber auch mit ihren eigenen menschlichen Schwächen zu kämpfen haben – Idiotie hat kein Heimat- und Herkunftsland. Die Geschichten der tapferen Chinesinnen und Chinesen aber müssen gehört werden.\nCamus hat uns über die Pest gelehrt: \"Das Böse in der Welt rührt fast immer von der Unwissenheit her, und der gute Wille ohne Verständnis kann so viel Schaden anrichten wie die Bosheit.\" Camus meinte tiefes Verständnis, kein unbestimmtes Halbwissen. Es gehört Mut dazu, sich die ganze Wahrheit anzusehen, weil man sie beleidigend finden könnte; weil man andere damit beleidigen könne; weil man sich vielleicht unwohl fühlt mit ihr oder bei anderen Unwohlsein schafft. Aus dieser Coronavirus-Krise ließe sich als Erstes lernen, dass man zwischen der chinesischen Regierung und den Menschen in China unterscheiden muss. Gelänge dies, wäre es ein Fortschritt.\n"}, {"content": "Pompeo conveyed 'strong U.S. objections' to Beijing over COVID-19 accusations.

HONG KONG — When a virus enters the human body, it's in a race against time to hijack cells, reproduce and spread. Its survival depends on it, because once the body's immune system detects the intruder an all-out microscopic war follows. \n While the Sars-CoV-2 virus behind the present pandemic has killed thousands and spread fear around the world, the immune system — which has evolved over millions of years of fighting pathogens — shows no such trepidation. It responds with ferocity to obliterate the invader, led by armies of killer T-cells. \n That immune system is one reason the human species still exists, but in some cases its fight against viruses can resemble the scorched-earth policy of warfare, where everything in the area of the conflict takes damage, meaning body tissue itself. The immune system takes no prisoners. \n But before the war at the cellular level, the virus slips into the body, navigating past defences in the mucus that gathers in noses and throats, on the hunt for cells it can commandeer. At the same time, it's trying to disguise its presence to avoid tripping the chemical alarm system of the immune system — a deadly game of hide-and-seek. \n In the first few hours after the pathogen's entry, it was \"almost like a dance between the innate immune response and the virus\", said Mr Gene Olinger, an immunologist with the US-based scientific institute MRIGlobal. The virus tries different tricks to dodge the immune system's many detection devices. \n This was the start of what become an \"arms race\" between the virus and immune system, said Ms Marjolein Kikkert, an associate professor who researches this type of biochemical conflict at Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands. \n \"All viruses, including this one, will have multiple ways that they look to circumvent or suppress immune response ... there's an arms race, especially in the beginning, when the virus is trying to prevent these first responses,\" Ms Kikkert said. \n Once the immune system is triggered and a T-cell finds a body cell that has become a virus factory, it typically latches on and fires molecules that punch through the cell's membrane, killing it and everything inside. \n But as Sars-CoV-2 is a newly discovered virus, researchers have not had enough laboratory time to determine the specifics of how the battle plays out. That leaves questions like why some healthy people infected with Sars-CoV-2 become severely ill and others do not, researchers have said. \n Much of what is suspected about how the body fights back is based on research on the body's immune response to closely related coronavirus infections, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). There are also the clinical records of patients with Covid-19, the disease caused by Sars-CoV-2. \n What that indicates is that \"every part of the immune system is needed to clear this virus\", according to Mr Stanley Perlman, a professor of immunology at the University of Iowa, whose lab is now replenishing its stock of lab mice genetically engineered for research on immune response to Sars. \n As the body's immune response can be so aggressive, researchers say that the war against the virus can do damage that causes fatal repercussions in the body. \n In particular, Sars-CoV-2 attacks the lungs, an especially sensitive battleground. Also, as the immune system tries to fight a virus that it has never before encountered, it can go into overdrive, causing excessive damage to adjoining cells and tissue. \n The body's early-warning system for invading pathogens was multilayered, Ms Kikkert said. An abnormality inside a cell would typically trigger a \"cascade\" of cell signals. \n She said this led to the production of \"alarm bell\" proteins that warned surrounding cells about the presence of the virus and triggered a flood of immune molecules, creating an \"antiviral state\". \n As more alarms sound throughout the body, the Sars-CoV-2 virus races to propagate and attack more cells. When T-cells arrive to hunt, capture and kill infected cells, the lungs become a battleground, swelling with immune cells, molecules and the fluid that they use to navigate. \n Mr Olinger said that once a T-cell found an infected cell it latched on, \"almost like a Velcro connection\". \"These cells will attach and send molecules that go through that cell and start to kill it,\" he said. \n Meanwhile, antibodies, Y-shaped proteins, also arrive and swarm onto the virus, smothering the spikes it uses to attach to healthy cells. Larger white blood cells called macrophages also sweep in, swallowing big clusters of dead virus particles. \n As this cellular carnage spreads, dead cells pile up in the lungs. \n \"They are clogging the airways and reducing the oxygen flow,\" said Ms Ashley St John, an assistant professor at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore who researches immune pathology. \n \"You need that tissue to be able to stretch and fill with oxygen, but at the same time you are filling it with immune cells and fluid ... it can prevent someone who is trying to breathe from getting enough oxygen,\" she said. \n Some patients who recover from this stage, their lungs can heal. Others may recover, but suffer lasting damage. \n China released data at the end of February that indicates that about 80 per cent of the Sars-CoV-2 infections were mild to moderate, while 14 per cent were severe. The remaining 6 per cent of critical patients may have suffered respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. \n Globally, about 3.4 per cent of infected people might die from a Sars-CoV-2 infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week, although that number may change as disease controls evolve. In China, the fatality rate fell during the course of the outbreak and the increase in infections. \n In interviews, researchers said that the exact way Sars-CoV-2 behaved in the body was still being investigated, but it was clear it took the heaviest toll on the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. \n More than 20 per cent of infected people aged over 80 were likely to die. Death rates for those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease are double the average rate, according to statistics from the WHO-China Joint Mission on Covid-19 published at the end of February. \n Some researchers suspect that in the \"hide-and-seek\" period, Sars-CoV-2 compromises the early immune response, either by dividing too rapidly for the system to keep up or disrupting the way the immune system regulates itself. \n There was some evidence this can push a panicked system into overdrive and a \"cytokine storm\" follows that causes tissue inflammation. \n \"With a cytokine storm you have a situation where the brakes aren't working and you have all of these [immune] products [going] out of control ... cells infiltrating into the tissue, breakdown of blood vessels,\" St John said. \n As the body sent out alarms for cells to come to fight the virus, too many or the wrong combination could show up, causing excessive tissue damage, Mr Olinger said. \n \"The lung is the worst place to have that happen. Those cells are there to kill, they are there to encapsulate, and control the infection ... over-response can lead to the damage in the lungs. Cells in that region are not able to transfer oxygen ... it can lead to death of the tissue.\" \n An overwhelming immune response could also lead to death itself, researchers said. \n Getting to the bottom of the \"dance\" between the virus and the immune system's response was something that was hard to do without watching it play out in cells and in animals, Mr Olinger said. \n \"The reality is that until you have the virus in hand you really can't answer a lot of those questions,\" he added. \n \"[This virus] turned science upside down on us, because we know more about the genomic sequence now, whereas in the past other outbreaks that would come way after we had grown the virus and played with it in the laboratory, known how it performs in different cell types.\" \n That is the work now facing researchers like those in Mr Perlman's laboratory as they hope to use mice to get a ringside seat to the fight between Sars-CoV-2 and a mammal immune system. \n Such work needed to be done to work out how to build a Sars-CoV-2 vaccine, Mr Perlman said. \n \"How do you make a vaccine that works well if you are not sure what you need to protect a person from infection?\" SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST \n "}, {"content": "Coronavírus: Petróleo Brent cai 2% com receios de um recuo da procura.

The disease manifestation ranges from asymptomatic to severe,\" G Arunkumar, director of the Manipal Institute of Virology, told PTI.\n\"As per the available limited information, initial transmission appears to be zoonotic origin, though the source is yet be identified. There is report of human to human transmission in the press but needs to be confirmed by authentic sources,\" he said.\nThe discovery of a novel strain of the virus in China has compelled nations to quarantine passengers from the country and issue travel advisories, while prompting the WHO to convene an emergency meet on the matter.\nCountries around the world have sounded an alert following the confirmation of the first case of human-to-human transmission of the deadly infectious disease.\nCases have been detected in Thailand, Japan and South Korea.\nIndia has instructed screening of travellers from China at airports in Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata via thermal scanners.\n'The Emergency Committee on the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will ascertain whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage it,' WHO tweeted on Tuesday ahead of the meeting.\nCoronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people, according to the WHO.\nSeveral known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.\nOn December 31, 2019, the WHO China Country Office was informed of mysterious cases of pneumonia detected in Wuhan City in China's Hubei Province.\nThe novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative agent by Chinese authorities on January 7.\nThe WHO has offered guidance to countries on how they can prepare for it, including monitoring the sick, and treating patients.\nThis includes protocols for testing samples, treating patients, controlling infection in health centres, maintaining the right supplies, and communicating with the public about this new virus.\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), human coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others through the air by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands.\nThe viruses can also spread by touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands, the CDC said.\nIn pregnant women, the more severe versions of MERS and SARS coronaviruses can be serious. According to a case study published in 2014 in The Journal of\nInfectious Diseases, a woman infected with MERS had a stillbirth.\nTill date, there is no vaccine to protect against this family of viruses.\nHowever, based on currently available information, the WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel or trade.\n'Countries are encouraged to continue strengthening their preparedness for health emergencies in line with the international health regulations,' the WHO said in a statement.\nIt said standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs.\nWHO also advises that people should avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.\n"}, {"content": "Conspiracy theories, accusations and myths spread faster than coronavirus. “It is quite evident that the clerical regime is covering up the real scope of this disease in Iran and has deliberately misled the public and failed to take proper actions to deal with this growing threat that has become epidemic,” writes the opposition Iranian group National Council of Resistance Iran (NCRI) on its website.\n“Iran’s regime, careless about the risks to the health of the Iranian people, did not take any precautionary measures,” the post continues, pointing out that one airline, Mahan Air, “not only continued its flights to China, but also engaged in the transportation of Chinese passengers,” as a result of which the coronavirus spread to other cities.\nThe resistance group, in exile in France, gives regular updates on the spread of the coronavirus in Iran, saying that the government is not doing enough to slow the epidemic.\nThe regime has officially acknowledged 12 deaths and 64 infections – among them the vice-Minister of Health - but local reports indicate that the figures are much higher and the NCRI is quick to cite a report by official ILNA news agency – that was quickly altered - quoting member of parliament Ahmad Amirabiad Farahani as saying that, in the city of Qom alone, ten residents die per day as a result of the coronavirus.\nMeanwhile, the Iranian government-controlled press rejects criticism, but instead attacks neighboring Turkey, accusing “Turkish media” of hiding the fact that “Turkish airliners continued transporting passengers from China and did not say a word about the necessity of closing borders to Chinese tourists nor the cancellation of flights originating from China.”\nFalun Gong\nA New York-based Chinese meditation group, the Falun Gong, which is designated as an “evil cult” by Beijing and banned in China, publishes daily updates on the spread of the coronavirus within China, with sometimes very detailed, but not always verifiable reports.\nOn 25 February, the Falun Gong’s website carried the story about a neighborhood in Wuhan which was given up by the Communist Party, as there were too many cases of the deadly virus. Reporting them, the story goes, would get the authorities of the enclave into trouble with the Beijing authorities, so local officials abandoned the inhabitants without help.\nThe meditation group also suggests that practicing Falun Gong may help to cure people from the illness, citing cases of infected people who recovered after reciting that “Falun Dafa is good”.\nRussia gets bats in the belfry\nIn January, Kremlin-sponsored tv-station Russia Today, came up with the story that the virus was spread among humans after they ate bat-soup.\nThat story was taken over by western media such as the British Daily Mail and may have encouraged Chinese authorities to close down wet markets where exotic animals such as ant-eaters and owls were sold for consumption.\nResearchers say that, even if coronaviral sequences have been detected in bats, there is no insurmountable evidence that bats are the real source of the current outbreak.\nAmerican bio-weapon\nAnother theory launched in Russia was floated late in January by the leader of the far-right Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who told a Moscow radio station that he thought coronavirus was an American bio-weapon or a big plot by pharmaceutical companies to get richer, adding that “pharmacists will become billionaires in 2020”.\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, the gossipy Washington Times floated the theory that the coronavirus was the result of a Chinese bio-warfare program.\nThe suspicions were fed by the fact that Wuhan is home to one of China’s top-level bio-research facilities, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was part of a Sino-French cooperation project based on the Inserm Jean Mérieux P4 facility in Lyon, but there is no clear link between the lab and the current coronavirus outbreak.\nRightwing radio show host Rush Limbaugh even went as far as saying that the virus was a Chinese communist conspiracy causing mass hysteria and bringing down US President Donald Trump.\nMyth busters\nTo fight misinformation, the World Health Organization has opened a webpage containing “myth busters,” for instance that hand dryers are not effective in killing the virus, nor is spraying alcohol or chlorine on the skin.\nMeanwhile, the site says, it is safe to receive a letter or a package from China, as the virus doesn’t survive very long in the open.\nGarlic, says the site, which may be effective against vampires, is not useful against the coronavirus.\n"}, {"content": "Homem com suspeitas de coronavírus no Hospital de São João no Porto.

Die bayerischen Gesundheitsbehörden bestätigten am Dienstag die vier ersten Fälle in der Bundesrepublik.\nZunächst war die neue Lungenkrankheit bei einem 33 Jahre alten Mann aus dem Landkreis Landsberg am Lech nachgewiesen worden. Er hatte sich in seiner Firma in einem Vorort von München bei einer Kollegin aus China infiziert. Am Dienstagabend teilte das bayerische Gesundheitsministerium mit, dass sich drei weitere Menschen mit dem neuartigen Coronavirus infiziert haben. „Auch diese Patienten sind Mitarbeiter der Firma aus dem Landkreis Starnberg“, hieß es weiter.\nDie vier Betroffenen wurden in der München Klinik Schwabing stationär aufgenommen und dort medizinisch überwacht und isoliert, wie das Ministerium mitteilte. „Bei einigen weiteren Kontaktpersonen läuft derzeit ein Test, ob auch hier eine Infizierung mit dem Coronavirus vorliegt.“ Bayerns Gesundheitsministerin Melanie Huml (CSU) sagte: „Es wurden insgesamt rund 40 Mitarbeiter der Firma ermittelt, die als enge Kontaktpersonen in Frage kommen. Die Betroffenen sollen am Mittwoch vorsichtshalber getestet werden.“ Dann will das Ministerium auch per Pressemitteilung über den aktuellen Sachstand informieren.\nDer 33-Jährige hatte sich nach Angaben des Bayerischen Landesamts für Gesundheit und Lebensmittelsicherheit (LGL) bei einer Kollegin aus China angesteckt, die in der vergangenen Woche zu einer Schulung zum Autozulieferer Webasto in den Gautinger Ortsteil Stockdorf im oberbayerischen Landkreis Starnberg gekommen war. Die Frau hatte ihre Infektion erst am 23. Januar auf dem Rückflug nach China bemerkt.\nDas neuartige Coronavirus 2019-nCoV kann eine Lungenkrankheit auslösen, an der im Hauptverbreitungsland China bereits mehr als 100 Menschen gestorben sind - die meisten davon waren ältere Patienten mit schweren Vorerkrankungen. Die Gesamtzahl der weltweit bekannten Erkrankungen ist inzwischen auf mehr als 4500 gestiegen, in China starben mindestens 106 Menschen an der Lungenkrankheit.\nDer erste Coronavirus-Patient war am Montag positiv auf das Virus getestet worden - da war er schon wieder zur Arbeit gegangen. „Es geht ihm recht gut, gestern Vormittag hat er noch gearbeitet“, sagte LGL-Präsident Andreas Zapf. „Er ist fieberfrei, hat auch derzeit keine Atemwegssymptomatik mehr“, fügte der behandelnde Chefarzt Clemens Wendtner vom Klinikum Schwabing hinzu. Der Mann befinde sich in einem Isolierzimmer, für andere Patienten bestehe keine Gefahr.\nDie Menschen, die mit der chinesischen und dem zuerst erkrankten deutschen Webasto-Mitarbeiter Kontakt hatten, stehen nach LGL-Angaben unter Beobachtung und sind aufgerufen, ihr Zuhause nicht zu verlassen. Der 33-jährige Patient ist Familienvater, sein Kind geht nach Angaben des Gesundheitsministeriums in eine Krippe im Landkreis Landsberg am Lech. Auch diese stehe nun unter Beobachtung, sagte LGL-Präsident Zapf. Über den Familienstand der drei weiteren Patienten wurde zunächst nichts bekannt. Der Leiter der Taskforce Infektiologie, Martin Hoch, betonte: „Die Zahl kann noch steigen.“\nDas neue Virus 2019-nCoV stammt ursprünglich vermutlich von einem Markt in der chinesischen Millionenstadt Wuhan, wo es wohl von dort gehandelten Wildtieren auf den Menschen übersprang. Nach derzeitiger Einschätzung von Experten verläuft die neuartige Lungenkrankheit offenbar in den meisten Fällen mild, womöglich sogar ohne Symptome.\nÜbertragungen vor den ersten Symptomen gelten als sehr selten. So liefert der erste bestätigte Coronavirus-Fall in Deutschland womöglich auch neue Erkenntnisse über die Ansteckungswege der Lungenkrankheit. Denn der Mann habe sich nach ersten Erkenntnissen bei der Chinesin angesteckt, obwohl sie zu dem Zeitpunkt noch keine Symptome der Krankheit zeigte.\nDie Behörden wollen nun nach und nach weitere Maßnahmen in Bayern einleiten. Eine offizielle Hotline der bayerischen Behörden wurde geschaltet, einige Krankenkassen taten das auch. Am Münchner Flughafen werden die Passagiere nach Angaben des Landesamtes mit Plakaten in drei Sprachen aufgefordert, bei Verdacht einer Infektion mit dem neuartigen Coronavirus einen Arzt aufzusuchen. Weitere Eskalationsstufen des Alarmplans sind möglich: Derzeit werde gemeinsam mit dem Bund beraten, „ob es sinnvoll sein kann, an Flughäfen Fieber zu messen“, sagte Ministerin Huml. Die weltgrößte Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg erwartet angesichts des Coronavirus-Ausbruchs in diesem Jahr weniger Besucher aus China.\nEinen Grund zur Panik gebe es trotz allem nicht, betonte Huml - ebenso wie ihr Amtskollege, Bundesgesundheitsminister Jens Spahn (CDU). Der Fall zeige, „dass wir gut vorbereitet sind“, sagte er. Die Gefahr für die Gesundheit der Menschen in Deutschland bleibe auch nach Einschätzung des Robert Koch-Instituts weiterhin gering.\nTrotzdem waren Atemschutzmasken in einzelnen Apotheken in Bayern ausverkauft. Er habe dies von Betrieben in Unterfranken und München gehört, sagte ein Sprecher des bayerischen Apothekerverbandes der Deutschen Presse-Agentur.\nDas Management von Webasto hat den Mitarbeitern in der Stockdorfer Zentrale für diese Woche freigestellt, ob sie ins Büro kommen wollen, oder lieber zuhause arbeiten. Webasto ist ein großer Zulieferer für die Automobilindustrie mit 13 400 Mitarbeitern und einem Umsatz von 3,4 Milliarden Euro. Schon zuvor hatte das Unternehmen sämtliche Dienstreisen nach China für die nächsten zwei Wochen abgesagt. Auch BMW, Audi und Siemens erklärten, dass nur noch zwingend notwendige Dienstreisen nach China angetreten werden.

Ya son nueve las víctimas mortales y el número de infectados sigue creciendo con cada hora del día: los últimos datos hablan de 440 enfermos. Por poner en perspectiva: el viernes eran solo 41, y la Comisión Municipal de Sanidad aseguraba que las pruebas médicas no arrojaban resultados positivos desde el pasado 3 de enero. La escalada de este nuevo coronavirus, descubierto hace dos semanas, recuerda a la del SARS, con el que guarda similitudes genéticas. La epidemia de 2002, también originada en China, causó la muerte de 700 personas en todo el mundo.\nLa mayor parte de las infecciones (270) se concentra en Wuhan, epicentro del brote surgido en diciembre. Desde esta ciudad, situada en la zona central del territorio chino y hogar de 11 millones de personas —más que Londres o Nueva York—, el patógeno ha comenzado a extenderse a las provincias vecinas. Si el pasado viernes no había ningún positivo fuera de allí, hoy son 38 los casos repartidos por otras 15 grandes urbes.\nPero estos datos podrían no ser del todo fiables. Un modelo desarrollado por expertos del Centro de Epidemiología de Enfermedades Infecciosas de la Universidad de Hong Kong sugiere que la realidad es aún más preocupante de lo que revelan las cifras oficiales. Según su informe, elaborado en colaboración con la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) y presentado este martes, el número total de infectados podría rozar ya los 1.500: 1.343 en Wuhan y 115 en el resto del país.\nEl escepticismo es lógico tratándose de un país en el que no impera la libertad de información. Muchos recuerdan, además, el precedente del SARS, cuando las autoridades negaron la existencia del virus durante semanas. El Partido Comunista Chino ha hecho referencia a ese mismo episodio para advertir a las administraciones locales y regionales de que deben informar con exactitud sobre el curso de los hechos. “Todo aquel que no diga la verdad será clavado al pilar de la vergüenza para toda la eternidad”, proclamó este lunes Chan An Jian, perfil oficial en redes sociales de la Comisión Central de Asuntos Políticos y Jurídicos, brazo supervisor del Partido en materia legal. Esta sentencia se suma a la intervención de ayer del secretario general Xi Jinping, en la que llamaba a “tomarse en serio” la contención del brote.\nExiste otro motivo para la intranquilidad: las estimaciones del modelo de la Universidad de Hong Kong responden a un “escenario moderado”, en el que Wuhan permanece como el único foco del brote y no aparecen enfermos altamente contagiosos, conocidos como “superpropagadores”. Este último factor de riesgo, no obstante, podría ser ya una realidad.\nLa OMS realizó ayer una visita a Wuhan junto a un grupo de expertos sanitarios chinos, liderados por el doctor Zhong Nanshan, director del Laboratorio Estatal de Enfermedades Infecciosas en Cantón y eminencia nacional en la materia. Sus hallazgos muestran que 15 empleados médicos en la ciudad habrían contraído el virus, lo que confirma la posibilidad del contagio entre humanos —un extremo descartado hasta este fin de semana—. 14 de ellos, además, habrían sido infectados por un solo paciente, según reveló ayer Nanshan en una entrevista con la televisión nacional, lo que abre la puerta a la existencia de estos “superpropagadores”. “La clave para controlar la expansión en este momento pasa por prevenir su aparición”, apuntó el investigador.\nMientras tanto, continúa también la expansión internacional. A los cuatro casos localizados hasta la fecha en Tailandia, Japón y Corea del Sur, se ha sumado este martes el primer positivo en Taiwán. Se trata de una mujer de 55 años que, como en los casos anteriores, también visitó Wuhan en las últimas semanas. “La paciente desarrolló los síntomas a partir del 11 de enero, pero no ingresó en un hospital”, ha informado esta tarde Huang Wang-ting, médico del Mando Central de Epidemias de Taiwán. El ministro de Sanidad de la isla, Chen Shih-chung, ha asegurado que ninguno de los familiares de la enferma presenta síntoma alguno, similares a los de una neumonía ordinaria, y que otras 46 personas que estuvieron en contacto con ella durante el trayecto de avión han sido puestas en observación. Asimismo, Filipinas y Australia también han anunciado haber tomado medidas ante los primeros casos sospechosos en su territorio nacional.\nLa OMS ha comunicado que celebrará mañana miércoles una reunión de emergencia para decidir si declara “una emergencia de salud pública internacional” a causa del brote. El Consejo de Estado chino, por su parte, también ha programado una rueda de prensa en la que detallará la evolución del virus en las últimas horas.\n"}, {"content": "covid-19: 1 new case confirmed in singapore, 2 more discharged.

BEIJING (AFP) - As the rest of the world is engulfed in the coronavirus pandemic, China says it has turned the tide against the disease that has killed thousands of people. \n From initial attempts to cover up the outbreak to later locking down cities and now declaring it \"basically curbed\", here is a look at how China grappled with Covid-19: \n The first case emerged in the central city of Wuhan on Dec 8 before several workers at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market began to fall sick with fever. \n On Dec 31, Wuhan health authorities announced 27 cases of suspected viral pneumonia linked to the market and notified the World Health Organisation. \n But officials insisted there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission and that it was \"preventable and controllable\". \n A day later, eight people were reprimanded by Wuhan police for \"spreading rumours\" about the then mysterious disease. \n There had been social media talk of a re-emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), another coronavirus which killed nearly 650 people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n Dr Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, was among those punished for raising the alarm. \n The number of cases in Wuhan jumped to 44 on Jan 3 and health authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore issued travel alerts. \n China announced the existence of a \"new type of coronavirus\" on Jan 9 and the first death two days later. \n But between Jan 5 and Jan 17, China reported no new cases of the virus, while Japan and Thailand declared their first infections. \n During this time, Wuhan and Hubei province pressed ahead with their annual legislative meetings despite the outbreak. \n Meanwhile, doctors were ordered to keep quiet about the virus and evidence of human transmission they had seen, according to an interview with Dr Ai Fen, one of the earliest medical whistle-blowers on the outbreak and a colleague of Dr Li. \n An annual mass banquet for 40,000 families organised by Wuhan authorities went ahead on Jan 18. \n The same day, Beijing sent a team of scientific experts to Wuhan to investigate. \n On Jan 20, President Xi Jinping ordered that the virus be \"resolutely contained\", in his first public comment on the issue. \n Human-to-human transmission was finally confirmed by a leading Chinese expert that day. \n This marked a major turning point in the epidemic, with 291 infections reported nationwide. \n Panic took hold in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, when it was abruptly placed on lockdown on Jan 23. The rest of Hubei province was sealed off in the following days. \n Wuhan hospitals, inundated with patients, reported dire shortages of medical supplies. Many who could not get timely treatment for themselves or relatives relayed personal tragedies on social media. \n The virus spread as hundreds of millions of people travelled across the country and abroad for the Chinese New Year holiday before travel curbs were imposed. \n On Jan 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a \"global emergency\". \n Between Feb 1 and Feb 7, cases in China ballooned from 11,791 to 31,161, while deaths reached 636. \n On Feb 7 the Wuhan medical whistle-blower Dr Li died from the coronavirus, triggering a wave of public grief and anger. \n Many grievances against the authorities were swiftly censored on social media. \n Days later, four high-profile local officials were purged and replaced to appease public disquiet - including the Communist Party secretaries of Wuhan and Hubei. \n The province recorded a huge jump of 14,840 new infections on Feb 13 due to a change in diagnostic criteria, raising questions about the credibility of China's data. \n Mr Xi, usually a ubiquitous presence on state media, remained out of the spotlight. \n But on Feb 15, Beijing released a speech by Mr Xi showing he had urged officials to contain the outbreak as early as Jan 7 - well before the authorities announced human-to-human transmission - in an attempt to boost the leader's public image. \n In late February and early March, the number of new cases in Hubei and other parts of China steadily declined as outbreaks flared up in Italy, Iran and South Korea. \n On Tuesday (March 10), Mr Xi visited Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began, suggesting the Communist Party was confident it had the situation under control. \n Wuhan officials touted the sealing off of all residential estates from Feb 11 as \"critical\" in curbing the spread in the city, although some experts believe it led to more cross-infections within households. \n After more than 4,600 deaths and 126,000 infections across the country, China is now trying to reshape the global narrative in response to overseas criticism, casting itself as a leader in the heroic fight against the virus while other countries struggle to cope. \n "}, {"content": "Stunned world grapples with 'once-in-100-year' coronavirus battle.

BEIJING: Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday (Jan 27) for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters. \n Yang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected more than 4,000 people and killed at least 106 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease. \n Yang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time. \n \"My brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don't get any new answers,\" Zhang told Reuters. \"Every time the responses are the same: 'There's no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what's going on.' The doctors are all very frustrated too.\" \n Officially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travellers from China for the virus within three days. \n However, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan's hospitals until about Jan 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. \n Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities. \n During that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China. \n Despite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. \n In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being \"rumour spreaders\". \n \"The doctor didn’t wear a mask, we didn’t know how to protect ourselves ... no one told us anything,\" a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. \n Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan 20, five days after she was hospitalised. \"I posted my aunt’s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.\" \n National, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some \"loopholes\" in initial treatment methods. \n Wuhan's mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognised that \"all parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information\". But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders. \n \"In local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I'm authorised,\" he said. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested. \n DELAYED RESPONSE \n China last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak. \n The country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. However, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned. \n Once a virus has been identified, \"You need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you’ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,\" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness. \n  \n Although information from the region is scarce, Adalja suggested China has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. \"We’re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,\" he said. \n John Edmunds, a professor at the centre for mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said China has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak. \n \"We have a very incomplete picture of what’s going on,\" he told Reuters. \"Whether it’s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, I don’t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.\" \n The shortage of testing supplies and China's initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people. \n \"The improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus's genome, building new hospitals at a moment's notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,\" said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan's Center for Chinese Studies. \n City managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. The week in which no new virus cases were reported in Hubei coincided with preparations for Chinese New Year and sessions of the province's National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. \n STILL WAITING \n Seven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said. \n But four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials. \n To qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is \"impossible to conduct the test right away\", an official at the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters. \n  \n Three hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll. \n Wuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters. \n \"Some severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn't be able to be treated,\" the worker told Reuters. \"The actual deaths were higher.\" \n Reuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker's account. Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. \n Zhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus. \n However, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test. \n None of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment. \n Sixty-nine-year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan 8, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had run out of beds, his daughter told Reuters. Xu's symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties. \n He was finally admitted on Jan 22 to queue for the test at Hankou hospital in Wuhan after his daughter publicised his case on Weibo. \n Researchers at Lancaster University estimate that only 5.1 per cent of infections in Wuhan have been identified. By Jan 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. More than 30,000 people in Wuhan are under observation, according to the city's health authorities. \n \"All we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,\" said a 33-year-old Wuhan woman surnamed Liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since Jan 14 and was still untested on Monday. \"At least if it's confirmed we have a direction. If there's no direction, there's no hope.\" \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram \n "}, {"content": "u.s. ramps up anti-coronavirus measures at border as impact spreads. SHANGHAI/WASHINGTON - The United States ramped up its response to the coronavirus epidemic on Friday, declaring a public health emergency and saying it would halt entry to foreign nationals who had been to China within the 14-day incubation period.  \n That measure followed on from an earlier travel advisory that warned Americans not to travel to China and angered Beijing.  \n Originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the flu-like virus first identified earlier in January has resulted in 213 deaths in China, according to local health authorities. Wuhan and the surrounding region of Hubei are in virtual quarantine.  \n More than 9,800 people have been infected in China and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions, with Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reporting their first cases on Thursday or Friday.  \n The World Health Organization said on Thursday that the epidemic constituted a public health emergency of international concern, a designation that triggers tighter global containment measures and coordination.  \n \"Following the World Health Organization's decision... I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States,\" U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said at a public briefing on Friday afternoon.  \n As of Sunday, U.S. citizens who had been in Hubei would be subject to compulsory quarantine, he said. Foreign nationals - aside from the immediate family of citizens and residents - who had travelled in China in the last 14 days would be denied entry, said Azar.  \n \"The risk is low in the United States... but our job is to keep that risk low as much as we can,\" he said.  \n The move will likely anger Beijing, which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with Washington. Earlier on Friday, it criticized the U.S. travel warning.  \n \"The World Health Organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the United States did the opposite,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. \"It's truly mean.\"  \n Other countries have also advised citizens to put off non-urgent travel to China or restricted flights. After reporting its first two cases of the illness, Russia on Friday restricted direct flights to China, its biggest trade partner.  \n Singapore, a major travel hub in Asia, stopped entry of passengers with a recent history of travel to China and also suspended visas for Chinese passport holders.  \n Many airlines have chosen to cancel or reduce flights, with airline crews pressuring carriers to act.  \n Governments around the world are evacuating citizens from Hubei. A plane with 83 British and 27 foreign nationals landed in Britain on Friday, while Japan, with 14 confirmed cases, has sent three flights to bring citizens home.  \n The United States said it would channel all flights from China through seven airports. It has put 195 Americans evacuated to California this week in quarantine.  \n The virus has an incubation of between one and 14 days, and there are some limited signs it may also be able to spread before any symptoms show.  \n  \n GLOBAL REVERBERATIONS  \n With major fallout inevitable for China's economy, which is the world's second largest, global shares posted their biggest weekly and monthly losses since August on Friday. [MKTS/GLOB]  \n The outbreak could \"reverberate globally,\" Moody's said.  \n In the latest impact to big name corporations, South Korea's Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> said it planned to halt production of a sport utility vehicle this weekend due to a supply disruption caused by the outbreak.  \n Home appliance maker Electrolux <ELUXb.ST> issued a similar warning, French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen <PEUP.PA> said its three plants in Wuhan will remain closed until mid-February, and tractor maker Deere & Co <DE.N> said it was temporarily shutting its facilities in China.  \n WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said the WHO did not support travel or trade curbs. Tedros reiterated in a series of tweets on Friday that his organization had confidence in China's capacity to control the 2019-nCoV virus.  \n \"Travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering info-sharing and medical supply chains and harming economies. We urge countries and companies to make evidence-based, consistent decisions.\"  \n  \n VIRUS EPICENTRE  \n The roughly 60 million residents of Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital, have had movements curbed to try and slow the spread of the disease. But some people were leaving and entering the area by foot on a bridge over the Yangtze river, a Reuters witness said, and infections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan.  \n China's statistics show just over 2% of infected people have died, suggesting the virus is less deadly than the 2002-2003 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  \n But economists say its financial impact could be bigger than SARS, which killed about 800 people at an estimated cost of $33 billion to the global economy, since China's share of the world economy is now far greater.  \n Like other respiratory infections, the coronavirus spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes. No deaths have been reported outside China, but it is still too early to know what its death rate will be.  \n \"The issue now with this is that there's a lot of unknowns,\" said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head Robert Redfield.  \n The WHO has reported at least eight cases of human-to-human transmission - as opposed to people coming infected from China - in four countries: the United States, Germany, Japan and Vietnam.

SINGAPORE — Three more people here have been diagnosed as being infected by the Covid-19 coronavirus, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Wednesday (Feb 19), while five people were discharged from hospital. \n Of the three new patients, one was admitted at first for dengue fever in the general ward of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. After she was found to have the Covid-19 virus, those who shared the ward with her had to be transferred to single wards and tested for infection as a precautionary measure, while contact tracing is ongoing for hospital workers who attended to her. \n It is unclear if she had both dengue and Covid-19 viruses. MOH said that contact tracing is underway for this patient to establish any links to previous cases or to recent travel to China. \n For the other two newly diagnosed patients, one is linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore cluster and another is linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster.  \n So far, 84 people in Singapore have been sickened by the virus. A total of 34 people have fully recovered and been discharged from hospital. For the 50 patients still in hospital, most are stable or improving. Four are in critical condition under intensive care, MOH said. \n With the assistance of the Singapore Police Force, links between a vast majority of locally transmitted cases have been established — they had travel history to China or were connected to existing clusters or other cases.  \n The five people discharged on Wednesday were: \n The first confirmed patient, a 66 year-old male Chinese national from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with his family on Jan 20 and stayed at the Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa in Sentosa \n A 42-year-old Singaporean woman who was a teacher at Victoria Junior College (Case 32) \n A 39-year-old Singaporean woman who went to the Life Church and Missions Singapore (Case 33) \n A 37-year-old Singaporean man from Certis Cisco who served quarantine orders on a Wuhan couple (case 44) \n A 30-year-old Singaporean man who went to the Catholic Church of Christ the King (Case 55)  \n  \n NEW CONFIRMED CASES \n Case 82 \n Case 82 is a 57-year-old Singaporean woman who did not go to China recently. She is warded in an isolation room at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH). \n She reported the onset of symptoms on Feb 9 and sought treatment at Jurong Polyclinic on Feb 10, as well as a general practitioner (GP) clinic on Feb 12. She went to the emergency department at NTFGH on Feb 13 and 15, and was admitted as a dengue patient in a general ward on Feb 15. \n Test results confirmed Covid-19 infection on the afternoon of Feb 18, and she was immediately transferred to an isolation room. \n As a precautionary measure, the patients who shared the room with her while she was in the general ward have been transferred to single rooms. They have been tested for Covid-19 infection and the results are pending. So far, none of them has any respiratory symptoms. \n Contact tracing of NTFGH staff members who had been in contact with the patient is underway. The room has also been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, MOH said. \n Before she was admitted, the woman had mostly stayed at home in the Jurong West Street 41 area, except when she had to seek medical treatment. \n Case 83 \n Case 83 is a 54-year-old Singaporean man who had not been to China lately, but he travels frequently to Malaysia for work purposes. He was confirmed to have Covid-19 infection on the morning of Feb 19, and is warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). \n He is linked to the cluster from The Life Church and Missions Singapore in Paya Lebar. \n Case 84 \n Case 84 is a 35-year-old Singaporean woman with no recent travel history to China. She tested positive for the virus on the morning of Feb 19, and is warded in an isolation room at NCID. She is linked to Case 66, a 28 year-old Singaporean man who works at Grace Assembly of God church and attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church on Jalan Peminpin in Marymount. \n UPDATE ON PREVIOUS CASE \n Case 80 is a 38-year-old Singaporean woman with no recent travel history to China. She is warded in an isolation room at the National University Hospital (NUH) and is linked to Case 66, who is part of the Grace Assembly of God cluster. \n She reported the onset of symptoms on Feb 4 and had sought treatment at a GP clinic on Feb 4 and 10. She was referred to NUH for a chest X-ray on Feb 11, and went back to NUH again on Feb 17. Test results confirmed Covid-19 infection on the morning of Feb 18. \n Before she was hospitalised, she had gone to work at NUH where she does administrative tasks and had not interacted with patients since the onset of symptoms. She lives along Fernvale Link in Sengkang. \n LINKS TO PREVIOUS CASES \n Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases, MOH said. This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force. \n Four of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33, 38 and 83), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road). \n Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34 and 40) are linked to Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road), a health product shop off Lavender Street. \n Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to the private business meeting held at the Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22 January. \n Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site. \n In total, 22 of the confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81 and 84) are linked to the Grace Assembly of God. \n Investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In addition to the clusters, MOH  said its investigations have identified the following links between cases: \n Case 44, a 37-year-old Singaporean man who works at Certis Cisco Centre and had served Quarantine Orders on two people from Wuhan, was linked to Cases 13 and 26, a mother-and-daughter pair from Wuhan; \n Case 72, a 40 year-old male Chinese national who is a Singapore work pass holder and has no recent travel history to China, is a non-medical contact of Case 59, a 61-year-old Singaporean man who works at a private hospital here; \n Case 75, a 71-year-old Singaporean woman, is a family member of Case 41, a 71-year-old Singaporean man who visited Paya Lebar Methodist Church and a gathering at Braddell Heights Residents’ Committee;  \n Case 77 is linked to Case 50, who in turn is linked to Case 65 and Case 55, a 30-year-old Singaporean man who works at Pulau Bukom and went to the Catholic Church of Christ the King. \n As of noon on Wednesday, MOH has identified 2,593 close contacts who have been quarantined.

While some of them have been inspirational, some have been unusual to say the least.\nFor instance, remember the doctor in China, who had a quick 10-minute wedding so that he could rush back to the hospital and treat the coronavirus patients?\nWell another couple’s wedding story is also going viral but for a very unusual reason because the celebration for their wedding went ahead without the bride and groom.\nA Singapore couple Joseph Yew and Kang Ting had gone for a trip to China to spend the Lunar New Year there. They had visited the Hunan province, which borders the Hubei province of which Wuhan is the capital. And right now, Wuhan is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.\nSo when guests expressed their concern over attending the couple’s wedding, they came with an unusual plan. Instead of attending the celebrations at the venue, the couple, dressed in their wedding ensembles, live streamed from their hotel room with their friends and family, who enjoyed the occasion in the wedding hall.\nIn fact, the couple even made their toasts and their speeches on the video call.\n\"Some of them said they were not coming. We wanted to postpone the wedding but the hotel was not willing to. They said everything had been arranged and it was non-negotiable. So we felt like we had no choice but to proceed with the wedding,\" Yew told BBC.\nThough the guests were shocked in the beginning but they were relieved too, \"I think if we had been there, the atmosphere would be different. People would have been wary,\" he added.\nThe couple actually got married in China in October, and had planned a grand dinner banquet in Singapore for their family and friends who were unable to make it to China.\n"}, {"content": "WRAPUP 3-American dies of coronavirus in China as toll set to surpass SARS. BEIJING (Reuters) - An American became the first confirmed non-Chinese victim of the new coronavirus on Saturday while a Japanese man also died with symptoms consistent with the disease, as the epidemic looked set to pass the death toll from the SARS pandemic.\nThe 60-year old U.S. citizen diagnosed with coronavirus died at Jinyintan Hospital in China’s Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak, on Feb. 6, a U.S. embassy spokesman in Beijing said.\n“We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss,” the spokesman told Reuters. “Out of the respect for the family’s privacy, we have no further comment.”\nA Japanese man in his sixties and hospitalized with pneumonia in Wuhan, in central Hubei province, also died after suffering symptoms consistent with the new coronavirus, Japan’s foreign ministry said.\nBut owing to difficulties in diagnosing the disease, the cause of death was given as viral pneumonia, the ministry said citing Chinese medical authorities.\nAs of noon on Thursday, 17 foreigners were being quarantined and treated for the disease in China, according to the latest government figures.\nThe death toll in mainland China rose by 86 to 722 on Saturday, according to authorities, and is poised to pass the 774 deaths recorded globally during the 2002-2003 pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that jumped from animals to humans in China.\nDuring the SARS outbreak between November 2002 and July 2003, the number of reported cases was 8,098, suggesting a far lower transmission rate than the latest coronavirus, but a higher mortality rate.\nTwo deaths have been reported outside of mainland China - in Hong Kong and the Philippines - from more than 330 cases in 27 countries and regions. Both of those victims were Chinese nationals.\n“It is hard to say how lethal this novel coronavirus infection is,” Professor Allen Cheng, an infectious diseases expert at Monash University in Melbourne, told Reuters.\n“While the crude mortality appears to be around 2%, there are likely to be many people who have been infected that haven’t been tested ... We probably won’t know the true case fatality for some time yet.”\nMost of the deaths in China have occurred in and around Wuhan. Hubei officials on Saturday reported 81 new deaths, 67 of those in Wuhan, a city in virtual lockdown. Across mainland China, the number of outstanding cases stood at 31,774.\nBeijing’s communist leadership has sealed off cities, canceled flights and closed factories to contain the epidemic, with ripple effects for global markets and businesses dependent on the world’s second-biggest economy.\nSaturday marked the final day of the Lunar New Year celebrations, usually characterized by family gatherings, fireworks, riddle-guessing and the lighting of lanterns.\nThis year, most people were eating dumplings, a traditional custom, at home alone. On national television a gala show will feature recitation of poems on counter-virus efforts instead of the usual music and dancing.\nNews of the death on Friday of Li Wenliang, a doctor who was reprimanded by police for raising the alarm about the new coronavirus, sparked sorrow and outrage on Chinese social media and rekindled memories of how Beijing was slow to tell the world about the SARS outbreak.\nHong Kong on Saturday was introducing a two-week quarantine for all people arriving from the mainland, or who have been there during the previous 14 days.\nMatthew Cheung, chief secretary for administration, said Hong Kong people returning from the mainland must stay home for a fortnight or risk a fine or jail.\nNon-Hong Kong residents must stay in government isolation centers or hotel rooms for the same period, facing the same penalties.\nWhile China is bearing the brunt, anxiety levels are  spiking across Asia, with Japan alarmed by the rising number of cases aboard a quarantined cruise ship, major foreign companies pulling out of an international airshow in Singapore, and Thailand losing money as Chinese tourists stay home.\nAnother three people on the cruise liner off Japan tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases from the ship to 64, Japan’s health ministry said.\nThailand reported seven new cases, including three Thais and four Chinese, bringing the total reported in the country to 32, among the world’s highest number of infections outside of China.\nTaiwan and Hong Kong urged residents not to hoard goods such as toilet paper amid signs of panic buying, and the World Health Organization (WHO) chief warned of worldwide shortages of medical gowns, masks and other protective equipment.\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) on Friday banned “any guests holding a Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports, regardless of when they were there last” from boarding the company’s ships.\nWHO emergency expert Mike Ryan said reports of Asians being shunned in the West over a perceived connection to coronavirus was “utterly and completely unacceptable and it needs to stop.”\nTaiwan’s government said that starting from Monday it would suspend all direct passenger and freight shipping between the island and China.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The emergence of a new virus in central China has brought back painful memories of another virulent respiratory disease that wreaked worldwide havoc and left the country’s health authorities struggling to rebuild public trust.\nBut global health experts said China has come a long way since 2003, when it was accused of trying to cover up a major outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a previously unknown virus believed to have emerged from the wet markets of Guangdong province before spreading into major cities. As many as 774 people died in an epidemic that reached nearly 30 countries.\nNow, nearly 17 years later, government officials insist they have learned from past mistakes as they try to contain the latest deadly viral pneumonia strain, which has infected 440 people, mostly in Wuhan city, and killed nine since it was first identified at the end of last month.\nLiu Heng, an adviser to China’s cabinet said it took the country about four or five months to announce the SARS outbreak to the public, and this time it had taken less than a month.\n“We are doing much better now... We are paying greater attention to preventing the epidemic,” he told reporters.\nLi Bin, vice minister at the National Health Commission, told reporters on Wednesday that since 2003, China had established comprehensive new procedures to handle major health threats.\n“With relatively complete prevention and control systems for sudden and infectious diseases in place since SARS ... and with the support of the broad masses of the public, we are confident of victory,” he said.\nA key factor watched by experts both at home and overseas has been the rapid disclosure of information about the genetic structure of the virus and the way it has spread through the population.\nLi said Beijing had learned from its experiences with SARS and was now sharing all relevant data with international stakeholders, including the World Health Organization (WHO).\n“The speed with which this virus has been identified is testament to changes in public health in China since SARS and strong global coordination through the WHO,” said Jeremy Farrar, a British infectious diseases specialist who also worked on combating SARS.\nExperts say the failures of SARS were caused by an under-resourced and overcentralised health system with little experience of infectious diseases and no information disclosure mechanisms. Local governments were also reluctant to take responsibility for the rapid spread of infections.\nBeijing has since established the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention that hooks up hospitals and clinics nationwide and reports outbreaks in real time. It has also set up specific mechanisms for new pneumonia strains.\n“China... has developed excellent disease surveillance systems since SARS, including real-time emergency department surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections, so this will help with rapid identification of new cases,” said Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity research programme at the Kirby Institute in Sydney.\nVice-minister Li said China’s health infrastructure was also now better able to cope, with the country ready to deploy several “back-up” hospitals that could be put into action should the number of infected people spike further.\nThe silence on the part of authorities during the early stages of SARS helped create a rumor mill that sparked panic in several major cities and brought the economy to a standstill. One estimate suggested China’s economy slowed by around 1-2 percentage points in 2003 as a result of SARS.\nThis time, officials have been warned they face public ignominy if they cover up any infections, and the message throughout state media has been about the need for greater transparency. Communist Party-backed tabloid Global Times said on Wednesday that “concealment would be a serious blow to the government’s credibility and might trigger greater social panic”.\nPresident Xi Jinping has vowed to curb the spread of the virus, which has erupted just before the nation begins its biggest holiday this week, the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions people travel.\nNevertheless, some people said Chinese officials are cracking down on those who spread news about the disease online.\nSocial media is still awash with cover-up claims, and some doubts are still being expressed about the accuracy and timeliness of China’s data.\n“We can only judge the information we are being provided and have no way to determine if any information is not being disclosed,” said MacIntyre.\nAnd the big test of lessons learned could be still to come, when new year travel could create countless new vectors for the potential transmission of the virus.\nAdam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said China has “come a long way” since the outbreak of SARS.\n“I’m not sure that we could expect more of them at this stage in the outbreak, particularly when they are understandably focused on responding to the outbreak and trying to contain it ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations,” he said.\n"}, {"content": "Mundo fecha as portas a viajantes da China com receio do coronavírus.

We really have to stop our usual economic activities and our usual human interactions. We have to stay at home and make every effort to save lives. It is worth putting every cost we have into saving lives,” he was quoted as saying.\nDictatorship\nChina, which is ruled by an authoritarian communist dictatorship, is extremely well positioned to mobilise large numbers of people.\nSince the Communist takeover in 1949, “mass mobilisation” has been a trusted tool of the Chinese Communist Party in organising millions of people to work for a common goal.\nBefore the 1978 capitalist revolution, Beijing's “mass mobilisation” resulted in disasters like the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution.\nBut the principles – the central leadership issues a decree, which is then transmitted to the grassroots and implemented by local police, party cells and thousands of neighborhood committees – have remained the same ever since 1978, when Deng Xiaoping started his capitalist reforms.\nIn today’s China, foreigners are often flabbergasted to see the short time it takes for the authorities to empty entire cities, as happens yearly during party celebrations.\nIn 2003, all cities and most villages in China’s countryside were locked down as a result of the Sars-1 epidemic. The policy is implemented swiftly and without much consideration or discussion, and, as recorded by human rights organisations, accompanied by ruthless censorship, police brutality and unnecessary suffering of many people. Critics of the Beijing regime claim dissidents and other “hostile elements” are also rounded up in the process.\nHerd mentality\nIn spite of criticism of its draconian measures, China now prides itself on having successfully contained the coronavirus outbreak. As a result, there has been widespread shock about plans by some European countries to counter the epidemic by using so-called “herd immunity,” where large segments of the population are exposed to the virus to be cured by the natural autodefence system of individuals.\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, in his speech on 15 March, said that “the virus will be among us for a long time to come … a large part of the population will be infected.”\nWhile the Netherlands' health authorities advised precautions such as washing hands, keeping a safe social distance and reporting to a medical service if showing symptoms, they did not impose a hard lockdown.\nProtective wall\nThe more people who get infected, Rutte argues, the more people will achieve immunity, resulting in “a protective wall”.\nThe policy the Dutch government has chosen is one of “controlled spreading” of the disease, and only among those who are not in risk groups, such as the elderly or chronically ill. These groups will be completely isolated.\nThe alternative, proposed and implemented by China, and now in force in Italy and France, is “complete lockdown,” minimising contact between people.\nRutte rejected this saying it would “lock down the country for at least a year” without a guaranteed success.\nRutte was echoing the UK’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who told the local media that the British would aim to achieve “herd immunity”, claiming that once 60 percent of the population (40 million people) contract the coronavirus, the resulting pool of natural immunity will limit the impact of the infection.\nThe remarks caused a tsunami of anger and ridicule on Chinese social platforms.\nSocial Darwinism\nCritics said the UK and other proponents of the ‘’herd immuninty” theory were promoting nothing less than social Darwinism, or “the survival of the fittest”.\n“This shows just how scientifically astute developed nations’ approaches to virus prevention are,” reads one ironic response on Chinese social media. “Combatting the virus by employing the Darwinian model of natural selection highlights the unique appeal of modern science.”\n\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 1-Taiwan accuses China of waging cyber 'war' to disrupt virus fight.

H. Chan School of Public Health in the study, that has not yet been peer-reviewed. \n “Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the Covid-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection,” said the researchers. \n The pre-print report, which was uploaded on online medical archive medRxiv, looked at aggregated data of imported cases as of Feb 4 from the World Health Organization (WHO), taking into account 191 territories around the world. \n Imported cases are those with known travel history from China. \n The researchers also compared the records with air travel data from various sources, including the International Air Travel Association, and the surveillance capacity of nations based on the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which last year ranked Singapore’s preparedness for major disease outbreaks below Malaysia and Thailand. \n Using a model to determine how well countries have detected imported cases, the researchers picked Singapore as a benchmark based on its demonstrated ability to pick up confirmed carriers of Sars-CoV-2, the technical name of the virus which causes the disease Covid-19. \n They also cited a previous study, also by a similar team of Harvard researchers, which found that among countries with substantial travel volume, Singapore had “the highest ratio of detected imported cases to daily travel volume”. \n The previous study named Singapore as a statistical anomaly which had 12 more reported import cases than what had been expected, based on daily travel volume. \n The same report uploaded online last Tuesday had suggested that Indonesia, which has not detected any cases of Covid-19 so far, might have missed cases. The report was called “insulting” by Indonesian Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto earlier this week. \n Harvard Professor Marc Lipsitch said in response to the criticism that the academics had meant to be “helpful” and had conducted the study to see if the total number of detected cases was representative of the actual incidence of Covid-19. \n In the latest study, the researchers, including Prof Lipsitch who was involved in both studies, said their model is 95 per cent statistically reliable. \n The researchers said their model in the latest study is 95 per cent statistically reliable. \n High surveillance countries, such as Thailand, Australia and South Korea, came in at 40 per cent of the city-state’s ability to detect imported cases, the study concluded. Low surveillance ones, such as several African and Middle Eastern nations, achieve just 11 per cent of Singapore’s capacity. \n “Put another way, this implies that the true number of cases in travellers is at least 2.8 times the number that has been detected,” the study said. \n However, Singapore’s detection is “probably not 100 per cent efficient”, and the model was also able to estimate that there are around 1.8 undetected cases for every detected Covid-19 patient in the city-state. \n It noted the number of Singapore cases that have no known links to China or any recent travel history. “Singapore’s detection like that in other countries has relied largely on symptoms and travel history, so the number of asymptomatic or low-severity cases missed by such a strategy is unknown,” the authors said. \n What the study implies is that the true number of Covid-19 cases could be higher than previously thought, they added. \n The model proves that the number of undetected cases of coronavirus is correlated to air travel connectivity and is inverse to a country’s detection capacity — and that the risks of the virus going undetected could happen anywhere around the world. \n “(This could lead) to the potential risk of self-sustained transmission, which may be an early stage of a global pandemic,” the study said. \n "}, {"content": "Portugal tem mais duas ambulâncias dedicadas para casos suspeitos de coronavírus. O dispositivo para responder a casos suspeitos com o novo coronavírus foi alargado, com mais duas ambulâncias do INEM – uma em Coimbra e outra em Faro. Quanto aos 20 cidadãos que chegaram no último domingo a Portugal, repatriados da cidade chinesa de Wuhan, vão repetir as análises quando estiverem perto do fim da quarentena.\nO anúncio foi feito esta quinta-feira, em conferência de imprensa, pelo presidente do INEM Luís Meira. Portugal tem agora quatro ambulâncias para transporte de casos suspeitos. “Temos as duas ambulâncias preparadas no Porto e em Lisboa, sendo que desde ontem [quarta-feira] reforçámos essa possibilidade [de resposta] com mais duas equipas em Coimbra e em Faro, para a eventualidade de termos novos casos”, disse o responsável, salientando que tudo foi feito em “estrita articulação” com a Direcção-Geral da Saúde (DGS). E caso seja necessário reforçar medidas e envolver os parceiros do INEM, isso será feito.\nJá na quarta-feira a directora-geral da Saúde disse que Portugal está a preparar uma segunda linha de acção para a eventualidade de surgirem mais casos suspeitos. “A nossa prioridade são as regiões autónomas. E ter um hospital na região Centro – Coimbra — e no Sul do país. E haverá ainda uma outra linha, com 15 a 20 hospitais preparados do ponto de vista laboratorial e de seguimento dos doentes. A escalada de meios é à medida da escalada da epidemia.”\nGraça Freitas adiantou que neste momento todas as Administrações Regionais de saúde “activaram já os planos de contingência” e instituições “estão a fazer o treino dos profissionais novos, a rever circuitos, as áreas possíveis de isolamento, a reforçar equipamentos de protecção individual e a testar planos”.\nO presidente do INEM aproveitou para responder às criticas de falta de equipamento de protecção individual, feitas pelo Sindicato dos Técnicos de Emergência Pré-Hospitalar. “Está a ser preparado e se for preciso, no momento certo, o INEM irá disponibilizar o reforço desse equipamento a esses parceiros”, afirmou, salientando que neste momento “não há qualquer indicação para massificar esse tipo de equipamentos”.\nAcrescentou ainda que as equipas de pré-hospitalar “sabem que podem contactar com doentes portadores de determinadas doenças, algumas transmissíveis, fora do contexto que estamos a viver e as medidas básicas de controlo de infecção devem estar activas sempre”.\nA questão foi levantada depois do encaminhamento de um caso suspeito com o novo coronavírus de Felgueiras para o Porto. Luís Meira explicou que na altura em que os bombeiros se deslocaram à fabrica onde estava o técnico italiano, este ainda não era um caso validado e havia a indicação de que estaria com dificuldades respiratórias. Por isso, afirmou, a prioridade foi responder de imediato ao doente. E que, quando o caso foi validado, ficou em isolamento e foi encaminhado para o hospital de referência.\nUm artigo assinado por quatro especialistas em saúde pública na revista científica da Ordem dos Médicos Acta Médica Portuguesa, publicado esta quinta-feira, alerta para a possibilidade de Portugal poder não estar preparado para conter eventuais casos de infecção pelo novo coronavírus. Não fala deste caso em concreto, mas refere a “falta de preparação” ao lidar com um caso suspeito.\nGraça Freitas reforçou que o caso do Porto “foi devidamente encaminhado do ponto de vista clínico e de saúde pública”, tendo chegado ao hospital que devia, internado em condições de isolamento e com testes realizados pelo laboratório de referência. “O que terá corrido menos bem? A parte da tranquilidade social”, assumiu.\n“Poder-se-ia ter falado primeiro com as pessoas e tranquilizar. Mas a primeira prioridade é pôr o doente no hospital certo e em segurança”, afirmou, salientando que “às vezes os processos de validação são complexos”. E por isso, levar mais tempo até que seja dada uma validação ou não.\nE rejeitou as críticas feitas no artigo. “Já estivemos preparados no passado e estamos agora. A prova é que encontramos casos suspeitos, validamos e encaminhamos para os hospitais certos. As três outras situações, como sabem, chegaram rápida e exemplarmente ao respectivo hospital. A partir de um caso deduzir que não estamos preparados não me parece que seja a questão mais correcta”, afirmou Graça Freitas, referindo que a questão da tranquilidade social “terá de ser acautelada em futuras intervenções”.\nOs 20 repatriados da cidade chinesa de Wuhan estão agora todos juntos no hospital Pulido Valente, depois de o grupo ter pedido para ficar no mesmo espaço. E desde esta quinta-feira, entre as 10 e as 17 horas, poderão vir ao exterior num espaço que lhes foi reservado e cumprindo as regras de segurança com o uso de máscara.\nA repetição das análises será feita “próximo do fim do período de isolamento profiláctico”, disse a directora-geral da Saúde.

It was the biggest football game in Atalanta's history and a third of Bergamo's population made the short trip to Milan's famed San Siro Stadium.\nNearly 2,500 fans of visiting Spanish club Valencia also traveled to that Champions League match.\nMore than a month later, experts are pointing to the February 19 game as one of the biggest reasons why Bergamo has become one of the epicenters of the coronavirus pandemic - a \"biological bomb\" was the way one respiratory specialist put it - and why 35% of Valencia's team became infected.\nThe match, which local media have dubbed \"Game Zero,\" was held two days before the first case of locally transmitted COVID-19 was confirmed in Italy.\n\"We were mid-February so we didn't have the circumstances of what was happening,\" Bergamo Mayor Giorgio Gori said this week during a live Facebook chat with the Foreign Press Association in Rome. \"If it's true what they're saying that the virus was already circulating in Europe in January, then it's very probable that 40,000 Bergamaschi in the stands of San Siro, all together, exchanged the virus between them. As is possible that so many Bergamaschi that night got together in houses, bars to watch the match and did the same.\n\"Unfortunately, we couldn't have known. No one knew the virus was already here,\" the mayor added. \"It was inevitable.\"\nLess than a week after the game, the first cases were reported in the province of Bergamo.\nAt about the same time in Valencia, a journalist who traveled to the match became the second person infected in the region, and it didn't take long before people who were in contact with him also had the virus, as did Valencia fans who were at the game.\nWhile Atalanta announced its first positive case Tuesday for goalkeeper Marco Sportiello, Valencia said more than a third of its squad got infected, \"despite the strict measures adopted by the club\" after the match in Milan.\nAs of Tuesday, nearly 7,000 people in the province of Bergamo had tested positive for COVID-19 and more than 1,000 people had died from the virus - making Bergamo the most deadly province in all of Italy for the pandemic. The Valencia region had more than 2,600 people infected.\n'Champions League match huge accelerator for contagion'\nLuca Lorini, the head of the intensive care unit at the Pope John XXIII hospital in Bergamo, currently has 88 patients under his care with the coronavirus; not including many more in other parts of the hospital.\n\"I'm sure that 40,000 people hugging and kissing each other while standing a centimeter apart - four times, because Atalanta scored four goals (the final result was 4-1) - was definitely a huge accelerator for contagion,\" Lorini told The Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\"Right now we're at war. When peace time comes, I can assure you we will go and see how many of the 40,000 people who went to the game became infected,\" Lorini added. \"Right now we have other priorities.\"\nSilvio Brusaferro, the head of Italy's Superior Institute of Health, said over the weekend at the nightly nationally televised briefing by the civil protection agency that the game was \"one of the hypotheses\" being evaluated as a source of the crisis in Bergamo.\n\"It's certainly an analysis that can be made,\" Brusaferro said.\nBy last week, Bergamo's cemetery became so overwhelmed by the number of dead that military trucks began transporting bodies to a neighboring region for cremation.\nItaly remained the European country with the most cases, nearly 70,000, and with almost 7,000 deaths - the most worldwide and more than twice as many as China.\nSpain is the next country in Europe with the most cases, nearly 48,000, and it has surpassed China in the number of deaths with more than 3,400.\nMore than 435,000 people worldwide have been infected and the number of dead closed in on 20,000, according to the running count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Overall, more than 100,000 have recovered.\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\nThe official attendance for the Feb. 19 game was 45,792 - a \"home\" record for Atalanta, a small club making its debut in Europe's top club competition.\nAtalanta captain Alejandro \"Papu\" Gómez told Argentine daily Olé it was \"terrible\" to have played that game.\n\"It's a city of 120,000 people and that day (40,000) went to the San Siro,\" the Argentine said. \"It was a historic match for Atalanta, something unique. To give you an idea, my wife took three hours to get to Milan, when that trip normally takes 40 minutes.\"\nThe game was played in Milan because Atalanta's stadium in Bergamo didn't meet the requirements set by European soccer governing body UEFA.\nBefore the match, Valencia fans freely roamed around Milan and gathered at some of the city's plazas, including the Piazza del Duomo, drinking and chanting team songs.\nLooking back, the conditions for virus contagion were high, with thousands of people gathering without much concern - at a time when the outbreak in Europe wasn't yet known - and then traveling back home. Nearly 30 busloads of fans made the 60-kilometer (37-mile) trip from Bergamo to Milan.\nThe evening before the match, there was no social distancing as officials from both clubs mingled and exchanged gifts and handshakes at a gala dinner offered by Atalanta.\n\"I have heard a lot (of theories), I'll say mine: Feb. 19, 40,000 Bergamaschi went to San Siro for Atalanta-Valencia,\" Fabiano di Marco, the chief pneumologist at the hospital in Bergamo, told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. \"In buses, cars, trains. A biological bomb, unfortunately.\"\nValencia defender Ezequiel Garay was the first Spanish league player to test positive for COVID-19. The team played a Spanish league game against Alavés about two weeks after the game in Milan, and later Alavés reported that 15 people in the club were infected, though it did not say the cases were directly related to the match against Valencia.\nLook at Atlanta match before restarting leagues: Italian football association president\nItalian soccer players' association president Damiano Tommasi believes sports authorities should look long and hard at the Atalanta match before restarting leagues.\n\"Look at what's happening in China, where players are testing positive for the coronavirus now - despite all the safety rules and precautions being taken,\" Tommasi told the AP, referring to a recent positive test for former Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini with Chinese club Shandong Lunen.\nFellaini's positive test was alarming because, while the outbreak began spreading in China, the virus has reportedly been receding there.\n\"It's not going to be enough to just test the athletes,\" Tommasi added. \"The entire setting needs to be safe. Because if one team is stuck, it blocks the entire system.\"\nAfter winning the first leg, Atalanta advanced to the Champions League quarterfinals following another victory in the second leg on March 10, which was played in an empty Mestalla Stadium in Valencia after Spanish authorities prohibited games involving teams from northern Italy to be played with fans. A few thousand Valencia supporters gathered at the Mestalla to welcome the team, though, and to watch the match together in nearby bars and restaurants.\nOver the past month, Atalanta has mourned the deaths of five former staff members. While announcements on the club website made no mention of the virus, local media have reported that at least four of them died with COVID-19.\nStill, only one positive test from Atalanta has been announced.\n\"Some squads have chosen not to test their players unless they show symptoms,\" Tommasi said. \"Other squads tested everyone. These are individual choices.\n\"The head of the civil protection agency has talked about the likelihood that for every proven positive case there are probably 10 actual positives. The high number of positives at Valencia makes you wonder.\"\nWith the Champions League suspended because of the pandemic, Atalanta has no idea when it might play in the quarterfinals - which again would be the club's biggest game in its history. In the meantime, both the Bergamo team and Valencia are left wondering about the unforeseen effects of their match in February.\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 8-Number of U.S. coronavirus cases of unknown origin climbs to four. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. public health officials said they have identified four “presumptive” coronavirus cases believed to have emerged from community transmission of the infection, signaling a turning point in efforts to contain the disease in the United States.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a statement on Friday citing three such cases newly diagnosed by state public health authorities - one each in California, Oregon and Washington state.\nIf confirmed by the CDC, together with a previous case of unknown origin announced on Wednesday in California, that would bring to four the number of diagnosed individuals in the United States with no history of travel to a country where the virus is circulating and no close contact with an infected person.\nThe three latest patients were diagnosed based on results obtained in their respective states from CDC-supplied test kits and are considered “presumptive positive” cases pending CDC confirmatory testing, the U.S. agency said.\nA fourth presumptive positive was also announced in Washington state on Friday, but that one is “likely travel-related,” the CDC said.\nStill, the three latest cases of apparent community transmission, plus the one identified earlier this week in California, are a sign the virus is now spreading within at least four separate locations up and down the U.S. West Coast.\nThey span nearly 900 miles from California’s Silicon Valley region in Santa Clara County north to the Puget Sound near Seattle.\n“What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don’t know to what degree,” said Dr. Sara Cody, the chief public health officer for Santa Clara County, speaking of the newly diagnosed case there, the latest of three in her county and the 10th statewide.\nEven as confirmation was pending there, the CDC sent a team to assist local authorities in tracing close contacts the patient had with others in a bid to curb transmission.\nUntil this week, the CDC had counted 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21, none fatal. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China, where the outbreak originated. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples.\nAn additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated from abroad, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC.\nThe latest flurry of cases came as the Trump administration said the United States would invoke a federal defense law to boost production of masks, gloves, gowns and other items needed to protect medical personnel from exposure.\nAround the world, more countries are reporting new infections, companies have curtailed travel and global stock markets have tumbled.\nPresident Donald Trump said at the White House on Friday the United States will decide “very soon” about whether to bar entry to travelers from countries other than China where community transmission has emerged.\nAt a rally in South Carolina on Friday night, Trump defended his administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak and accused Democrats of politicizing the disease.\n“This is their new hoax,” Trump said at the event, held a day before the state’s Democratic presidential primary.\nThe U.S. State Department has issued travel advisories for several nations and on Friday it said Americans should reconsider travel to Italy, where nearly 900 coronavirus cases have been confirmed. A similar warning was issued earlier this week for South Korea, which has hundreds of infections.\nA government task force appointed by Trump to deal with the threat will meet at the White House on Saturday morning, according to an administration official.\nLatest figures from China, where the outbreak started late last year, indicated that nearly 80,000 people have been infected, with more than 2,800 deaths. The World Health Organization reported 57 deaths in 46 other countries.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a closed-door briefing in the U.S. House of Representatives that sustained spread of the coronavirus meant there would be many more infections in the United States, according to a source.\nFauci warned lawmakers the country lacked enough testing resources, the source said on condition of anonymity. The CDC said it has revised its criteria for who should be tested and is ramping up testing capabilities.\n“Our goal is to have every state and local health department online and doing their own testing by the end of next week,” CDC official Nancy Messonier told reporters.\nA vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop, health officials have said.\nThe United States has decided to postpone a meeting with leaders of Southeast Asian countries it had planned to host on March 14 in Las Vegas because of worries about the outbreak.\nU.S. and global stocks plummeted as rattled investors braced for the prospect that a pandemic could further dent an already slowing world economy.\nThe S&P 500 .SPX fell for the seventh straight day on Friday, suffering its biggest weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis.

Esta mañana, las calles en Wuhan están poco transitadas. Un manto de contaminación cubre el cielo, dándole un aspecto gris y espeso. A las diez de la mañana de este jueves, tres de la madrugada en la España peninsular, entró en vigor el veto anunciado este miércoles por las autoridades locales. Desde ese momento, y hasta nuevo aviso, las 11 millones de personas que están dentro de la población no pueden salir de ella, ni tampoco puede entrar nadie, lo que convierte a este municipio del centro de China en una ciudad cerrada. El Gobierno chino pretende, de este modo, poner coto a la propagación del recién descubierto coronavirus 2019-nCoV, el cual ha realizado un avance significativo en los últimos días, tanto fuera como dentro de sus fronteras. Los datos más recientes sitúan los casos en 18 muertos y cerca de 634 infectados.\nEsta medida afecta a todos los vuelos, trenes y autobuses, así como al servicio de metro. En la estación de Yunfei, por ejemplo, han colocado una reja en todos los accesos menos uno. Allí, un guardia de seguridad que prefiere no revelar su nombre comenta, algo antes de que a las diez de la mañana entrase en vigor el cierre, que la cantidad de gente es mucho menor que la de un día normal. Se confiesa “deseoso de volver a casa”. La prohibición afecta también a taxis interurbanos, aunque en la calle se ve alguno, y en Didi —una aplicación telefónica similar a Uber— no hay conductores disponibles. Las autopistas han sido cortadas, por lo que los coches particulares tampoco pueden abandonar la ciudad.\nEste bloqueo es una de las medidas que incluye el protocolo de acción de mayor gravedad, cuya puesta en marcha anunció el miércoles el Consejo de Estado, aunque el escenario sigue catalogado como enfermedad infecciosa de nivel B, el segundo más alto. Otro de los preceptos contemplados es la movilización de las fuerzas armadas. Una ciudad cercana, Huanggang, situada a 70 kilómetros de Wuhan, también cerrará los servicios públicos de autobús y tren al final de este jueves, según ha anunciado su alcalde. Las autoridades han decretado también el cierre de los locales de entretenimiento de la localidad, de 7,5 millones de habitantes, como cines o cafés de Internet, y han pedido a la población que no salgan de ella salvo por circunstancias especiales, informa Reuters. Hará lo mismo la relativamente más pequeña Ezhou, de una población de un millón de residentes.\nAnte el anuncio del cerco en Wuhan, una gran cantidad de gente puso rumbo al aeropuerto y las estaciones de tren con el propósito de salir de la ciudad antes de que entrase en vigor. Una de ellas era Niki, una estudiante taiwanesa de 22 años que había venido a Wuhan a visitar a una amiga. Niki manifestaba la convicción de que lograría llegar a tiempo, ya que había encontrado un conductor particular dispuesta a llevarla. “¡He venido al sitio equivocado!”, se despedía mientras corría calle abajo empujando sus maletas. El aeropuerto de Wuhan se ha visto saturado, con colas de facturación de hasta 100 metros, según informaban medios locales.\nCon esta decisión, el Gobierno pretende aislar a la población, epicentro del brote, algo particularmente importante dada la proximidad del año nuevo chino. A esta festividad, que tendrá lugar el próximo sábado, le sigue una semana de vacaciones nacionales en la que la gente acostumbra a visitar familiares en otras partes del país o viajar al extranjero. Los desplazamientos pueden alcanzar estos días la cifra de 3.000 millones, en lo que constituye la mayor migración humana del mundo. Wuhan, hogar de 11 millones de personas —más que Londres o Nueva York—, es además un nudo en las comunicaciones ferroviarias chinas. Ya este jueves, en un contraste poco habitual, los escaparates de muchos establecimientos en la ciudad lucen las decoraciones típicas de estas fechas pese a estar en su mayoría vacíos.\nSe cumplen, por tanto, las instrucciones de Zhong Nanshan, científico que lidera el equipo que trata de doblegar el coronavirus. “Desde el momento en el que la transmisión entre humanos está probada [un extremo descartado hasta esta semana], la cuarentena debe ser la primera prioridad”, declaraba en una rueda de prensa celebrada el martes. Zhong, de 84 años, es la mayor eminencia china en enfermedades infecciosas y saltó a la fama en 2002 al dirigir la respuesta del Gobierno ante el SARS. Esta epidemia, también originada en China y que acabó con la vida de 700 personas en todo el mundo tras convertirse en una crisis global, está marcada en la memoria de la población. “La cuarentena es la medida más efectiva porque de momento no hemos desarrollado un medicamento específico para hacer frente al coronavirus”, sentenciaba el investigador.\nOtro de los requerimientos instaurados por las autoridades locales en Wuhan pasa por hacer obligatorio el uso de mascarillas en el espacio público. Este objeto se ha convertido en la primera línea de defensa contra el brote y nadie se mueve sin ella. En muchos de los supermercados, por otro lado, perfectamente abastecidos, el estante correspondiente a las mascarillas está vacío. “Se han vendido todas, hasta las del almacén. No sé cuándo traerán más”, apuntaba el empleado de una tienda de la calle Qinghuang, a cinco kilómetros del centro, protegido con la suya.\nPero ante el número creciente de casos, los hospitales parecen no dar abasto. El diario Noticias de Pekín informaba de que muchos de ellos están saturados de pacientes, algunos de los cuales hacen colas en el exterior pese a las bajas temperaturas. Las salas de transfusión también están abarrotadas, y muchos pacientes se agolpan, conectados a sus goteros, en el pasillo. “Mi padre tiene fiebre alta y problemas respiratorios desde el pasado 2 de enero. Después de que varios tratamientos no funcionaran, el pasado día 10 el hospital nos informó de que no podían ingresarle porque no tenían camas libres. Nos transfirieron al hospital Wuhan Xinhua y allí tampoco pudieron atenderle. Su condición ha empeorado, ya lleva 12 días con alta fiebre y cada día tiene que caminar hasta el centro de salud para que le den oxígeno: sin admisión, sin exámenes, sin cuarentena”, denunciaba un usuario en Weibo —red social similar a Twitter—.\nEl área de llegadas del aeropuerto de Wuhan estaba desierta en la noche del miércoles. Uno de los últimos vuelos del día apenas transportaba a dos decenas de pasajeros, todos protegidos con su máscara. Uno de ellos era Xian Pin, de 28 años y empleado de una firma financiera, quien se dirigía a la ciudad a causa por un compromiso profesional. “Es muy importante, si fuera cualquier otra cosa no se me ocurriría haber venido. He optado por limitar mi viaje al máximo, por lo que mañana volaré de vuelta a casa. Estoy muy preocupado”, apuntaba. Ante la imposición del veto, lo más probable es que Xian Pin no haya logrado su propósito. En el mismo avión, la azafata Lian compartía que los vuelos han experimentado un descenso notable en el número de pasajeros. Ella misma es de Wuhan, aunque citaba un refrán popular para ilustrar su tranquilidad: “Shi fu bushi huo, shi huo duo buguo”, “una bendición no es una maldición, y una maldición no tiene escapatoria”.\nEn las afueras del aeropuerto, en las que no se veían medidas de seguridad excepcionales, el conductor Zheng Wang se quejaba: “Llevo cinco horas parado en la cola, no vienen pasajeros, así que no nos movemos”. Su hijo, de 13 años, no va al colegio desde el pasado 10 de enero porque las clases se han suspendido. Preguntado por la credibilidad que otorga a las cifras oficiales de afectados, contesta: “De eso es mejor no hablar”. El Gobierno ha amenazado con castigar a todo aquel que contribuya a expandir rumores y a las administraciones locales o regionales que maquillen la realidad.\nA pesar de su inquietud, Xian Pin se mostraba optimista. No recuerda la epidemia del SARS porque “era demasiado pequeño”, pero está seguro de que en esta ocasión no será tan grave. “China es ahora un país poderoso, y nuestro líder Xi Jinping se ha dirigido al pueblo para asegurar que nuestras mejores mentes están trabajando en ello. Confío en que pronto pondremos al virus bajo control”.\n"}, {"content": "Covid-19: Wie groß ist das Risiko in Deutschland?. \nMit dem überraschend großen Covid-19-Ausbruch in Italien steigt die Sorge vor neuen Fällen in Deutschland. Zunächst unbemerkt bleibende Infektionsketten sind nach Experteneinschätzung auch hierzulande möglich. Das ist zum Virus Sars-CoV-2 und der von ihm verursachten Erkrankung Covid-19 bekannt:\nWie ansteckend ist das neue Coronavirus?\nEin Wert, wie viele andere Menschen ein Infizierter im Mittel ansteckt, lässt sich noch immer nicht gesichert angeben. Klar ist, dass sich das Virus durch Tröpfcheninfektion - etwa beim Husten und Sprechen - verbreitet. Und klar ist auch, dass der Erreger deutlich infektiöser ist als anfangs angenommen: Anders als beim eng verwandten Sars-Erreger vermehrt sich das Covid-19-Virus auch im Rachenbereich. Bei den oberen Atemwegen ist der Ansteckungsweg deutlich kürzer, als wenn ein Erreger erst aus der Lunge heraus und in die Lunge eines anderen Menschen hinein gelangen muss. Auch Grippeviren vermehren sich im Rachen.\nZudem weisen erste Ergebnisse darauf hin, dass das Virus auch über das Verdauungssystem und zumindest einige Tage über Oberflächen verbreitet werden kann. Ein bisher unterschätztes Risiko sei womöglich, dass in Stuhlproben von Patienten in der Initialphase einer Covid-19-Erkrankung „durchaus relevante Mengen“ von Sars-CoV-2 nachweisbar seien, hatte etwa Clemens Wendtner, Chefarzt der Infektiologie und Tropenmedizin an der München Klinik Schwabing, erklärt.\nIn welchem Umfang auch weitgehend oder ganz symptomfreie Menschen infektiös sein können, ist noch nicht klar.\nWie groß ist die Ansteckungsgefahr in Deutschland?\nMit der Vielzahl nachgewiesener Infektionen in Italien steigt wegen des Reiseverkehrs auch das Risiko einer Einschleppung von Covid-19 nach Deutschland. Das Risiko, dass anderswo in Europa ähnliche Cluster wie in Italien auftreten könnten, werde zurzeit als moderat bis hoch betrachtet, hieß es am Sonntagabend von der europäischen Präventionsbehörde ECDC. Einmal eingeschleppt könne sich das Virus schnell übertragen. ECDC-Direktorin Andrea Ammon erklärte, man rechne damit, dass es in den kommenden Tagen weitere Fälle in Italien sowie möglicherweise auch in anderen Teilen der EU geben werde.\nExperten nehmen an, dass es auch in europäischen Ländern längst weitere Infektionsketten geben könnte, von denen bisher niemand ahnt - auch in Deutschland. „Irgendwann wird es wahrscheinlich dazu kommen, dass unbemerkte Infektionen plötzlich bemerkt werden“, hatte der Berliner Virologe Christian Drosten kürzlich erklärt.\nWas würde ein Ausbruch in Deutschland bedeuten?\nEine Infektionswelle hierzulande könnte unter anderem volle Wartebereiche und Arztpraxen, belegte Intensivbetten und vollkommen überlastete Gesundheitsämter bedeuten, erklärte der Berliner Virologe Christian Drosten kürzlich. Der Vorstandschef der Charité, Heyo Kroemer betonte Mitte Februar, man bereite sich intensiv vor. Das Krankenhaussystem fahre im Winter generell unter Volllast - im Fall von Sars-CoV-2-Infektionen hierzulande hätten die Einrichtungen aber Spielräume, zum Beispiel durch das Verschieben nicht dringender Operationen.\nVom Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) hieß es, Ziel in Deutschland sei es, eine Erkrankungswelle hinauszuzögern, um zu vermeiden, dass die Covid-19- und die derzeitige Grippewelle zusammenfallen. „Wir müssen mit angemessenem Aufwand versuchen, die Ausbreitung zu verlangsamen, um einen intensiven Belastungspuls auf das Gesundheitssystem abzumildern“, erklärte Drosten. „Die Zahl der Infektionen sollte über eine möglichst lange Zeit ausgedehnt werden.“\nWie gefährlich ist das Virus?\nNach einer von Chinas Gesundheitsbehörde vorgestellten Analyse sterben im Land 2,3 Prozent der mit Sars-CoV-2 Infizierten. Betroffen sind demnach vor allem alte Menschen und solche mit schweren Vorerkrankungen wie Herzkreislauf-Erkrankungen oder Diabetes. Bei Menschen über 80 Jahren liegt die aus den dort vorliegenden Daten errechnete Todesrate bei knapp 15 Prozent, es sterben also in dieser Altersgruppe in China im Mittel etwa 15 von 100 Infizierten. In der Gruppe der 10 bis 39 Jahre alten Menschen sterben 0,2 Prozent der Infizierten, also etwa 2 von 1000 Betroffenen.\nIn der weit überwiegenden Zahl der Fälle - der Gesundheitsbehörde zufolge mehr als 80 Prozent - zeigen Menschen, die sich mit dem Covid-19-Erreger angesteckt haben, nur milde Symptome. Knapp 14 Prozent der Betroffenen entwickeln demnach schwere Symptome wie Atemnot, knapp 5 Prozent lebensbedrohliche Auswirkungen wie Atemstillstand, septischen Schock oder Multiorganversagen.\nAuch der Generaldirektor der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) hatte unter Bezug auf die Datenanalyse aus China von gut 80 Prozent milden Infektionsverläufen gesprochen. Es gebe zudem relativ wenige Fälle bei Kindern, sagte Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Noch sei unklar, warum das so sei.\nExperten gehen davon aus, dass die Sterblichkeit eigentlich geringer ist wie in China errechnet, unter anderem weil in der chinesischen Statistik viele mild verlaufende Infektionen gar nicht erfasst werden. Gesicherte Analysen zur Sterblichkeit aus anderen Ländern gibt es bisher aber nicht.\nWelche Symptome verursacht das neue Coronavirus?\nViele Menschen haben nur eine leichte Erkältungssymptomatik mit Frösteln und Halsschmerzen oder gar keine Symptome. Hinzukommen können Fieber, Husten und Atemprobleme, wie sie auch bei einer Grippe auftreten. Auch Kopfschmerzen oder Durchfall sind möglich. Die Inkubationszeit - der Zeitraum zwischen Infektion und Beginn von Symptomen - beträgt nach derzeitigem Stand meist 2 bis 14 Tage. Das ist der Grund dafür, dass Verdachtsfälle zwei Wochen isoliert werden.\nWie lässt sich die neue Lungenkrankheit behandeln?\nEine spezielle Therapie für die Erkrankung Covid-19 gibt es nicht. Schwer erkrankte Patienten werden symptomatisch behandelt: mit fiebersenkenden Mitteln, der Therapie etwaiger bakterieller Zusatzinfektionen und mitunter mechanischer Beatmung.\nGibt es eine schützende Impfung?\nNein. Etliche Labors weltweit forschen derzeit an Impfstoffen wie es sie auch bei der Grippe gibt. Die Entwicklung einer Schutzimpfung nimmt aber viel Zeit in Anspruch. Erste experimentelle Impfstoffe könne es noch dieses Jahr geben, sagte der Virologe Gerd Sutter von der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München kürzlich. Ob und wann sie an Menschen getestet werden könnten, sei eine andere Sache. „Die Entwicklung eines Impfstoffs ist ein langwieriger, mühsamer Prozess, vor allem die Zulassung und die klinische Prüfung eines Kandidaten.“\nWHO-Chefwissenschaftlerin Soumya Swaminathan glaubt, dass erste Impfstoff-Tests an Menschen in drei bis vier Monaten beginnen könnten. Ein zertifizierter Impfstoff für weitreichenden Einsatz stehe aber wohl erst in 18 Monaten zur Verfügung.\nHaben wir bei Covid-19 schon eine Pandemie?\nUnter einer Pandemie wird oft die Ausbreitung einer Krankheit beim Menschen über alle Kontinente verstanden. Dabei gilt eine Region als „betroffen“, wenn es dort Übertragungsketten gibt - und nicht nur einzelne Einschleppungen durch Reisende. Meldungen zu solchen Infektionsketten fehlen noch aus Afrika und Amerika. Die Frage sei gerade bei bestimmten afrikanischen und südamerikanischen Ländern, ob überhaupt auf das Virus getestet wird und Fälle erkannt werden, erklärte der Berliner Virologe Christian Drosten.\nDie Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) benutzt den Begriff Pandemie nicht mehr und erklärt eine solche auch nicht. Die Ernsthaftigkeit einer Seuche misst sie nur noch an der Erklärung einer „Notlage von internationaler Tragweite“. Mit der gängigen Definition von Pandemie hat diese nichts zu tun.\nWas für ein Virus ist Sars-CoV-2?\nDer wahrscheinlich im November oder Dezember auf einem Wildtiermarkt in Wuhan in China auf den Menschen übergesprungene Erreger Sars-2-CoV zählt zu den Coronaviren. Sie sind wegen der zackenartigen Strukturen auf ihrer Oberfläche so benannt. Sieben Vertreter dieser Gruppe verursachen beim Menschen Atemwegserkrankungen, etwa auch Schnupfen oder Husten.\nSars-CoV-2 eingeschlossen ist von dreien bekannt, dass sie mitunter schwere Symptome auslösen. Beim ebenfalls aus China stammenden Sars-Virus (Schweres Akutes Atemwegssyndrom) wurden 2002/2003 rund 8000 Fälle bekannt, etwa 800 Menschen starben. 2012 tauchte in Vorderasien das Mers-Virus (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) auf. Es ist weniger ansteckend, aber aggressiver: Von rund 2500 Infizierten bis November 2019 starben knapp 860 - etwa jeder dritte.\nDer Covid-19-Erreger Sars-CoV-2 ist genetisch sehr eng mit dem Sars-Erreger Sars-CoV verwandt, daher hat er auch den sehr ähnlichen Fachnamen erhalten.\nWie kann ich mich schützen?\nZum Schutz vor diesem wie auch anderen Viren empfehlen Experten gewöhnliche Hygienemaßnahmen: regelmäßiges Händewaschen, Desinfektionsmittel und Abstand zu Erkrankten. Den Nutzen von normalen Atemmasken - wie derzeit in China überall auf den Straßen zu sehen - schätzen Experten als eher gering ein. Von Nutzen kann sein, Umarmungen und Händeschütteln einzuschränken und von vielen Menschen berührte Oberflächen wie Türklinken, Haltegriffe und Aufzugknöpfe nicht anzufassen.\nWas bringt ein Mundschutz?\n„Gesunde Menschen, die in Deutschland unterwegs sind, brauchen keine Maske“, so ein Sprecher der Bundesvereinigung Deutscher Apothekerverbände (ABDA). Ein einfacher Mund-Nasen-Schutz, wie ihn Pfleger und Ärzte bei Eingriffen tragen, schütze sowieso nicht vor einer Ansteckung mit dem neuen Virus Sars-CoV-2.\nAußerdem gibt es richtige Atemschutzmasken mit eingebautem Filter. Eine Ansteckung durch Tröpfchen-Übertragung können aber auch da nur sogenannte FFP2- und FFP3-Masken verhindern - wenn sie denn richtig sitzen. „Im Alltag ist das aber unsinnig“, meinte Bernd Salzberger vom Universitätsklinikum Regensburg, Vorsitzender der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Infektiologie. Zumal man mit einer solchen Maske nur noch schwer atmen könne.\nWegen des neuartigen Coronavirus sind in vielen Apotheken Schutzmasken seit Wochen ausverkauft - und sie bekommen kaum Nachschub. Das erklärt der Bundesverband des pharmazeutischen Großhandels (PHAGRO).\nWann wird auf Coronavirus getestet?\nBei der routinemäßigen Überwachung von akuten Atemwegserkrankungen in Deutschland mit Hilfe von ausgewählten Arztpraxen wird nun auch Augenmerk auf das neuartige Coronavirus gelegt. Wie das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) in Berlin am Montag bekanntgab, hat die Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza (AGI) eine Untersuchung auf Sars-CoV-2 \"in das Spektrum der zu untersuchenden Erreger integriert\". Nach RKI-Angaben werden Atemwegsproben von Patienten aus 100 bis 150 Arztpraxen nun auch dahingehend analysiert. Zuvor hatte der MDR über das Thema berichtet.\nBei der ganzjährigen Überwachung durch die AGI geht es unter anderem um den Verlauf und die Stärke der Atemwegserkrankungen sowie um Merkmale der jeweils zirkulierenden Erreger. Anhand der Stichprobe der teilnehmenden Arztpraxen sollen Trends erkannt werden. Vorrangig geht es dabei um die Grippe, an der jedes Jahr Tausende Menschen in Deutschland erkranken. Getestet wird unter anderem auch auf Rhinoviren, die oft hinter Schnupfen und Erkältungen stecken.\nWo gibt es aktuelle Infos?\nDas Robert Koch-Institut (RKI), die Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung (BZgA) und das Bundesgesundheitsministerium (BMG) haben entsprechende Webseiten eingerichtet.

SINGAPORE: A new strain of coronavirus has infected hundreds of people in China and overseas, killing more than 20 people since it was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan earlier this month. \n Here is what we know about the outbreak so far: \n IT IS SIMILAR, BUT SO FAR MILDER THAN SARS \n The pathogen appears to be a new strain of coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause diseases such as the common cold and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds in mainland China and Hong Kong between 2002 and 2003. \n It has been named \"2019-nCoV\". \n Arnaud Fontanet, head of the department of epidemiology at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, told AFP that the new strain was 80 per cent genetically identical to SARS. \n The symptoms caused by the new virus appears to be less aggressive as compared to SARS, according to an AFP report. These include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. \n However, its milder nature can also cause alarm as it allows more people to travel further before symptoms can be detected, the director of the Institute of Global Health Antoine Flahault said. \n SUSPECTED TO HAVE ORIGINATED FROM ANIMALS, STARTED AT A SEAFOOD MARKET IN WUHAN \n The virus was first detected at a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has been shut down by authorities following the outbreak. \n  \n The market offered exotic wildlife for sale, including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game, AFP reported. \n Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. \n Two studies from China indicated that bats are the likely origin, as the strain was found to be closely related to a strain that exists in the animal. \n \"Bats being the native host of the Wuhan CoV (coronavirus) would be the logical and convenient reasoning, though it remains likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans,\" the researchers from several institutions in China wrote in a paper. \n Another study identified snakes as a possible intermediate host. \n HUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION, NOT AIRBORNE BUT SPREAD THROUGH WATER DROPLETS \n Animals have been determined as the source of the virus, but human-to-human transmission of the virus is \"affirmative\", top Chinese expert on infectious diseases Zhong Nanshan told state broadcaster CCTV. \n It has since been passed to people who have had no contact with the market where the virus first broke out. \n Doctor Nathalie MacDermott of King's College London told AFP that it seems likely that the virus is spread through droplets in the air from sneezing or coughing. \n There is currently no vaccine for the virus. \n RECOMMENDED PROTECTION \n Members of the public have been advised to take steps to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes wearing masks when experiencing respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, and observe good hygiene practices, like washing their hands frequently. \n They should also avoid places and close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness. \n Singapore’s Ministry of Health has issued an advisory asking travellers to avoid contact with live animals and consuming raw and undercooked meat. \n Those who are feeling unwell should also seek prompt medical attention, it added. \n  \n CITIES LOCKED DOWN IN CHINA \n More than 800 people have been infected with the coronavirus in China, with at least 26 fatalities reported. \n  \n Most of the patients came from Wuhan, where the virus started. It has since spread to other major cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. \n Transport in and out of Wuhan have ceased operations in an effort to prevent and control the spread of the virus. \n Authorities have also locked down several cities in Hubei province as a response to the outbreak. Entertainment venues such as Shanghai’s Disneyland park, theatres and karaoke bars have also been closed down. \n Hubei province authorities also said they were calling off cultural performances and public cultural venues. Travel agencies in the province have suspended business and the government has announced that refunds would be given to those who cancel transport tickets. \n Beijing has also cancelled Chinese New Year holiday gatherings at temples. \n NINE COUNTRIES REPORT CASES, INCLUDING SINGAPORE \n The first case of the virus reported outside of China was on Jan 13, when a Chinese woman was diagnosed with mild pneumonia after returning to Thailand from Wuhan. Another case was confirmed in Japan the next day. \n So far, there have been confirmed cases in nine countries outside of China. Thailand has the most reported cases, at four. \n Singapore reported its first case on Jan 23 – a 66-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on Jan 20 and stayed at Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa Resort. \n  \n He reported symptoms such as a sore throat and fever and went to Singapore General Hospital, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and identified as a suspect case. He was confirmed to have been infected by the virus on Jan 23. \n Contact tracing has been initiated to identify people who may have had close contact with the man. Two other cases have since been confirmed, one of which is the man’s 37-year-old son. \n Border screening has been implemented in several countries, including Singapore, as a response to the outbreak. \n Budget carrier Scoot has cancelled its daily flight to Wuhan and schools across the island have asked parents to declare their travel plans for the Chinese New Year weekend. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram \n "}, {"content": "With coronavirus genetic code in hand, scientists begin work on a vaccine.  When a newly organised vaccine research group at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) met for the first time this week, its members had expected to be able to ease into their work. But their mandate is to conduct human trials for emerging health threats - and their first assignment came at shocking speed.\nIn just three months time, they likely will be testing the first of a number of potential experimental vaccines against the new SARS-like coronavirus that is spreading in China and beyond.\n\"I told them, 'you are going to have your baptism of fire, folks',\" Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases within NIH, said of his inaugural address to the group this week.\nThree months from gene sequence to initial human testing would be the fastest the agency has ever gotten such a vaccine off the ground, Fauci said.\nThe outbreak, which began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, as of Friday had infected more than 800 people in China and killed 26.\nCoronavirus cases have also been confirmed in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal and the United States.\nChinese scientists were able to quickly identify the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus and officials posted it publicly within a few days, allowing scientific research teams to get to work right away.\nWith the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development work without needing a sample of the virus.\nDuring the deadly 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, it took US scientists 20 months to go from genetic sequence to the first phase of human trials. By that time, the outbreak was under control.\nThis time, research groups worldwide are already executing plans to test vaccines, treatments and other countermeasures to stop the newly identified virus from spreading globally.\nMULTI-PRONGED APPROACH\nThey are attacking from several angles, with global health and epidemic response agencies hoping at least one treatment will be in human trials within a few months.\nFauci's agency is partnering with US biotech Moderna Inc, which specializes in vaccines based on ribonucleic acid (RNA) - a chemical messenger that contains instructions for making proteins.\nThat team hopes to make an RNA vaccine based on one of the crown-like spikes on the surface of the coronavirus that gives the family of viruses their name, an approach that, unlike many vaccines, would not expose people to the virus.\nAt the University of Queensland in Australia, scientists backed by the global health emergency group the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said they are working on what they describe as a \"molecular clamp\" vaccine approach.\nThe technology adds a gene to viral proteins to stabilize them and trick the body into thinking it is seeing a live virus and create antibodies against it.\nKeith Chappell, an expert in the University's school of chemistry and molecular biosciences, said the technology is designed as \"a platform approach to generate vaccines against a range of human and animal viruses.\"\nIt has already shown promising results in lab tests on other dangerous viruses such as Ebola and the coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)- a cousin of SARS and the Wuhan virus.\nNovavax, which already has a vaccine in development against MERS, says it is now working on one for the Wuhan coronavirus.\nScientists also are turning to infection-fighting proteins known as monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, that were developed against the SARS and MERS coronaviruses.\nThe hope is that similarities with the Wuhan virus will offer enough overlap in the antibodies to help people infected in the China outbreak.\nVir Biotechnology Chief Scientific Officer Herbert Virgin said his company has a library of monoclonal antibodies that have shown some success against SARS and MERS in lab tests.\nSome of these antibodies have been shown to neutralize coronaviruses, Virgin said, and \"may have the potential to treat and prevent (the) Wuhan coronavirus.\"\n"}, {"content": "OMS promete apoio a São Tomé e Príncipe em eventuais casos de coronavírus.

A procura de um tratamento e de uma vacina está ainda a ser estudada.\nGuterres considerou que a crise do novo coronavírus necessita de \"cooperação e solidariedade internacionais muito fortes\".\n\"Nós devemos evitar a estigmatização que pode, por vezes, acompanhar uma situação como esta, na qual, de repente, pessoas que não têm nada a ver com isso são estigmatizadas por uma razão ou outra\", acrescentou.\n\"Acho importante manter uma perspetiva que leve em consideração os direitos humanos\", concluiu."}, {"content": "China aumenta o seu soft power com a luta contra o coronavírus. Na semana passada, o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros de Itália, Luigi di Maio, mostrava a chegada de um carregamento de material de luta contra o novo coronavírus enviado pela China. Esta semana houve novo carregamento para a Itália, desta vez da Alemanha, partilhado pelo ministro da Saúde, mas teve menos atenção.\nA recuperar de quarentenas draconianas e com produção acelerada, a China está agora a dirigir-se à Europa, novo epicentro da pandemia, com um misto de ajuda e comércio de produtos que servem para protecção e tratamento de pessoas infectadas com o novo coronavírus ou doentes com covid-19 - depois de ter sido muito criticada pela gestão inicial da crise.\nO país era já, antes da pandemia, um dos principais fabricantes de máscaras cirúrgicas e de protecção respiratória. “A vantagem da China em ajuda material é aumentada porque muito do que o mundo precisa para combater o coronavírus é feito na China”, dizem num artigo na revista Foreign Affairs Kurt M. Campbell, CEO do Asia Group (grupo de consultoria com sede em Washington), e Rush Doshi, director da Iniciativa Estratégica da China no centro de estudos Brookings Institution (na mesma cidade). “Agora, através de uma mobilização industrial como em tempo de guerra, [Pequim] aumentou em mais de dez vezes a produção, dando-lhe a capacidade de as disponibilizar para o mundo”, notam os dois autores.\nA presidente da Comissão Europeia, Ursula von der Leyen, disse que o primeiro-ministro chinês, Li Keqiang, concordou com o envio de dois milhões de máscaras cirúrgicas, 200 mil máscaras para protecção respiratória e 500 mil testes para a União Europeia. Von der Leyen disse que a UE está a aumentar a produção, mas que demorará ainda até conseguir ter o material pronto.\nTambém lembrou que quando a China começou a ser atingida, a União Europeia enviou mais de 50 toneladas de equipamento de protecção. “A China não se esqueceu”, e “hoje estamos nós no centro da pandemia, e somos nós que precisamos deste equipamento.”\nEste apoio à União Europeia junta-se ao que a China já deu não só a Itália como a outros países, como Espanha ou Bélgica, e que incluiu também envio de médicos. Nem tudo são doações, há também venda (como a acordada com o Hospital de S. João, no Porto, facilitada por autoridades locais), e nem tudo é feito pelo Governo, o multimilionário Jack Ma (da plataforma de compras online Alibaba) doou um milhão de máscaras e centenas de milhares de kits para testes aos Estados Unidos.\nO Presidente chinês, Xi Jinping, disse ao primeiro-ministro italiano, Giuseppe Conte, que esperava criar uma “Rota da Seda de Saúde”, numa referência ao seu projecto Nova Rota da Seda, que tem sido visto com especial desconfiança por alguns países europeus, sobretudo do Norte. Já ao chefe do Governo espanhol Pedro Sánchez, Xi disse que “depois da tempestade vem a bonança”, e que nesta altura os dois deveriam aumentar a cooperação e trocas comerciais.\nA principal estratégia da China, escreve o Politico, é mostrar que “o país que foi a origem do vírus está agora na linha da frente para tentar salvar a humanidade, enquanto a União Europeia não consegue agir e a outra superpotência do mundo está ocupada a apontar dedos”. \nSão esforços de ajuda reais, apontam peritos, notando que apesar disso não são apenas altruístas e que os fins políticos também merecem atenção. “Não há nada de mal no facto de a China ajudar países europeus, e outros, especialmente agora que ganhou uma vantagem por ter contido o coronavírus”, disse Noah Barkin, do centro de estudos German Marshall Fund, ao diário britânico The Guardian. “Mas também é claro que [Pequim] vê esta ajuda como uma ferramenta de propaganda.”\nO maior trunfo é a ajuda aos países europeus e, nota o South China Morning Post, a ajuda directa à União Europeia marca uma diferença diplomática em relação às acções com países individualmente. Aqui, a sua atitude contrasta com a menor solidariedade dos europeus, sobretudo em relação a Itália, o primeiro e mais afectado. E ainda mais, se comparada com a atitude dos Estados Unidos, com o Presidente norte-americano, Donald Trump, a tentar comprar para os EUA os direitos exclusivos de uma vacina a ser desenvolvida na Alemanha (os EUA negaram esta tentativa, o Governo alemão confirmou), e a sujeitar os países do espaço Schengen a uma proibição de entrada sem coordenação anterior. “Enquanto Trump atinge a Europa com uma proibição de viajar, a China é o amigo generoso e altruísta”, diz Barkin.\nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\nNo artigo da Foreign Affairs, Campbell e Doshi ressalvam que “nas últimas sete décadas, o estatuto dos EUA como líder global tem sido construído não só com base na riqueza e poder mas, tão importante como isso, na legitimidade que decorre do modo de governar domesticamente, da provisão de bens públicos globais, e da vontade de coordenar, e conseguir, uma resposta global a crises”. \nOra na questão da pandemia actual, que testa todas estas três vertentes, “Washington está, até agora, a falhar”. E do outro lado, “Pequim está a mover-se de modo rápido e habilidoso, aproveitando a abertura criada pelos erros dos EUA, para preencher o vazio e posicionar-se como o líder global na resposta à pandemia”. \n"}, {"content": "Covid-19: Líderes do G20 reúnem-se na quinta-feira por videoconferência para debater medidas.

LONDON: Companies and tourists out of pocket from the global disruption caused by the virus epidemic in China risk meeting a cold shoulder from insurers, industry experts warn. \n Basic travel insurance policies are unlikely to cover epidemics. Instead, individuals are being advised initially to consult their credit card or travel providers to get refunded for cancelled bookings, and for medical costs. \n Leading British insurer Aviva said customers need to have specific coverage for \"travel disruption\" as part of their policy to be sure of reimbursement for changes to their plans. \n \"We're monitoring the situation closely, but so far the overwhelming majority of claims relate to customers who are travelling to and from China,\" an Aviva spokeswoman said. \n Allianz of Germany said the first port of call for individuals suffering disruption should be their airline or travel agency, rather than their insurer. \n The company said the outbreak was \"clearly a very urgent alert\" but at this stage, normal terms and conditions of insurance contracts applied. \n CORONAVIRUS A \"KNOWN EVENT\" \n The General Insurance Association of Singapore (GIA) said that most insurers \"consider the 2019-nCoV a known event\", and have issued consumer advisories on travel insurance claims related to or arising from the event. \n Customers should approach their insurers if they are in doubt about whether a claim is covered in their respective policies - this includes travel cancellation, flight postponement and trip curtailment arising from the coronavirus situation. \n They should also keep themselves updated on insurers' latest consumer advisories, GIA said. \n The eligibility of claims can be affected by a cut-off date for coverage, affected regions visited and reasons for travel disruption, it added. \n For companies such as airlines that are now ripping up their China plans, there may be no recourse from their insurers, according to Clarissa Franks, risk management placement leader at insurance broker Marsh in London. \n Communicable diseases will typically only be covered if airlines have taken out specialist coverage. But that would come at a cost that probably outweighs the risk-benefit return, Franks said. \n RIPPLE EFFECTS \n It is too early to determine overall costs to the insurance industry from the deadly coronavirus, experts said. \n The reinsurance market at Lloyd's of London has not seen any untoward activity from traditional insurers looking to hedge their exposure to risks arising from this outbreak, two sources in the underwriting trade said. \n But even if they are not covered for communicable diseases specifically, companies will be checking the fine print as ripple effects flow through their China operations and global supply chains, following Beijing's decision to quarantine entire cities. \n As with SARS and other pandemics of recent years such as swine flu, Zika and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the industry will be \"paying very close attention to this\", Association of British Insurers spokesman Malcolm Tarling said. \n He cautioned individuals and companies: \"If someone travels (to China) against government advice, then most policies will be invalidated. If you believe your trip is essential, you need to talk to your insurer first.\" \n  \n RISK CALCULUS \n The closest analogy is SARS, which first broke out in China in 2002 and led to a slew of disputes between companies and their insurance providers. \n For the travel industry alone, the impact of SARS was estimated by the World Travel and Tourism Council at US$30 billion to US$50 billion. \n But China's economy accounted for 5 per cent of the global gross domestic product then, compared to nearly a fifth today, according to World Bank data. \n More Chinese now travel abroad than any other nationality, and they spend the most on average while away. \n The number of infections from the new virus stands at more than 20,000, and the World Health Organization has declared a public health emergency. \n But health experts stress its mortality rate among patients is lower than for SARS. \n In a blog, Risk Management Solutions noted that several sporting and cultural events have already been cancelled in China, \"and all risk stakeholders will be anxious over the number of months before 2019-nCoV (the novel coronavirus) is contained\". \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram \n "}, {"content": "British PM Boris Johnson calls PM Narendra Modi to discuss coronavirus crisis.

A Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) diz que são necessários 675 milhões de dólares (cerca de 613 milhões de euros) para aplicar um plano global que combata vírus nos próximos três meses, anunciou-se esta quarta-feira em conferência de imprensa. A OMS também revelou que especialistas se reunirão em Genebra (na Suíça) a 11 e 12 de Fevereiro para definir prioridades na investigação e desenvolvimento de medicamentos, diagnósticos e vacinas. Até agora, há quase 25 mil pessoas infectadas e quase 500 mortes causadas por este vírus.\nPor agora, a OMS pediu um fundo de 675 milhões de dólares para combater o vírus no mundo e na China entre Fevereiro e Abril. Desses, 60 milhões de dólares (cerca de 54 milhões de euros) serão para as operações da OMS e o restante para os países que estão especialmente em risco. Este é o orçamento do Plano Estratégico de Preparação e Resposta, que inclui actividades e recursos para organizações internacionais combaterem o novo coronavírus. O objectivo é limitar a transmissão entre pessoas, sobretudo nos países mais vulneráveis, assim como identificar, isolar e cuidar precocemente dos doentes ou ainda minimizar o impacto económico e social.\n“A minha maior preocupação é nos países que hoje não têm sistemas a funcionar para detectar pessoas contagiadas pelo vírus”, disse Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “É necessário apoio urgente para reforçar sistemas de saúde que detectem, diagnostiquem e protejam mais transmissão entre humanos e profissionais de saúde.” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-geral da OMS, também disse que “muito em breve” uma equipa da OMS irá à China.\n“A eficácia da resposta ao surto depende das medidas de preparação”, disse por sua vez Mike Ryan, director do programa de emergência da OMS. “Esta é a razão por estarmos a procurar recursos para salvaguardar os países mais vulneráveis.”\nUma das grandes questões é também o avanço nos tratamentos para o novo coronavírus. Até agora, não há qualquer fármaco específico ou vacina contra o vírus. Devido a algumas especulações sobre o desenvolvimento de novos tratamentos, a OMS fez questão de reforçar esta semana que “ainda não há terapias eficazes contra este 2019-nCoV” e que vários especialistas vão reunir-se este mês para estabelecer as prioridades desses avanços.\nMesmo não havendo um tratamento específico, o Governo chinês tem sugerido fármacos antivirais usados para tratar o VIH, nomeadamente o lopinavir e o ritonavir, e a inalação de uma dose de interferão-alfa nebulizado duas vezes por dia. A empresa Gilead Sciences também está a testar uma terapia antiviral para o vírus do ébola com doentes infectados pelo novo coronavírus.\nQuanto à vacina, cientistas na Austrália desenvolveram uma versão do vírus cultivada em laboratório, o que pode ser um passo importante no desenvolvimento de uma vacina. Também a Aliança para Inovações de Prontidão para Epidemias (CEPI, na sigla em inglês) já anunciou que três diferentes equipas de investigação estão a desenvolver vacinas e que o objectivo é que comecem em Junho os ensaios clínicos.\nO ministro da saúde russo, Mikhail Murashko, também disse esta quarta-feira que os cientistas na Rússia esperam levar, pelo menos, entre oito e dez meses a desenvolver uma vacina para o vírus. “Hoje o processo de desenvolver uma vacina não se faz num curto período de tempo. Uma vacina está a ser desenvolvida em pelo menos de oito a dez meses”, disse, citado pela agência noticiosa russa Interfax. Na semana passada, a Rússia tinha anunciado que estava a trabalhar numa vacina com a China.\nA escolha de um novo nome para este vírus – temporariamente designado 2019-nCoV pela OMS – pode parecer algo menor. “O nome [oficial] do novo vírus está com muito atraso porque o foco até agora tem sido na resposta à saúde pública”, diz Crystal Watson, professora do Centro Johns Hopkins para a Segurança da Saúde (EUA), citada no site da BBC. Contudo, há algumas razões que fazem com que a escolha do nome se torne mais prioritária. “Quando não temos um nome oficial, há o perigo de as pessoas comecem a usar termos como ‘vírus chinês’ e que possam criar uma reacção negativa contra certas populações.”\nA escolha do nome está a cargo do Comité Internacional de Taxonomia de Vírus (ICTV, na sigla em inglês). De acordo com as orientações do comité, o nome não deve incluir localizações geográficas, nomes de pessoas, o nome de um animal ou tipo de comida, nem referências a uma cultura ou indústria. Esse nome deve ser curto e descritivo, como SARS (síndrome respiratória aguda grave). Um grupo do ICTV já está a deliberar sobre o novo nome.\nOs nomes oficiais podem tornar-se também um problema. Aliás, em 2015, OMS criticou o nome MERS (síndrome respiratória do Médio Oriente), uma vez que podia provocar, por exemplo, uma reacção negativa contra membros de comunidades religiosas e étnicas.\nAinda há muito a desvendar sobre o vírus, mas um dos dados que se pensam estar já adquiridos é o que a transmissão pode ocorrer no período antes da manifestação dos sintomas. Inicialmente, uma das provas mais fortes a favor dessa hipótese vinha de uma mulher chinesa que tinha tido uma reunião em Munique: teria contagiado outras pessoas e que só teria tido sintomas dias depois. Esta situação foi publicada na revista científica The New England Journal of Medicine. Contudo, os investigadores apenas se tinham baseado nos relatos dos doentes alemães. O Instituto Robert Koch, a agência de saúde pública alemã, e a Autoridade de Saúde e Segurança Alimentar do estado da Baviera falaram com a doente chinesa e foram agora informados que ela ainda teve sintomas durante a sua estadia na Alemanha. Apesar destas novas informações, outros dados fundamentam a hipótese que a transmissão assintomática ocorre.\nEsta quarta-feira foi ainda anunciado o caso da pessoa mais nova infectada com o novo coronavírus. Os órgãos de comunicação social chineses noticiaram que um bebé foi diagnosticado com o vírus apenas 30 horas depois de ter nascido, refere-se no jornal inglês The Guardian. De acordo com a televisão estatal chinesa CCTV, o vírus tinha sido detectado na mãe do bebé antes do parto. Esta quarta-feira também se confirmou mais quatro casos em Singapura, incluindo num bebé com seis meses.\nAinda sobre a transmissão do vírus, veio a confirmar-se na última semana que um médico que lançou um alerta sobre o coronavírus também está infectado. A história deste médico oftalmologista, Li Wenliang, começou a 30 de Dezembro quando escreveu uma mensagem no seu grupo de amigos da faculdade. Nessa mensagem, referia que no seu hospital estavam sete doentes com sintomas semelhantes aos da SARS. Pedia ainda que os seus amigos e as suas famílias tivessem cuidado.\nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\nComo a mensagem acabou por se tornar viral, a polícia acusou-o de espalhar rumores, o que podia levá-lo à prisão durante sete anos. De acordo com o jornal espanhol El País, outros sete médicos receberam a mesma advertência. O médico acabou por ter de assinar uma declaração em que assumia a sua falha e prometia não voltar a fazer o mesmo. Poucos dias depois, acabou por ficar contagiado pelo novo coronavírus, depois de ter tratado de um doente.\nO novo coronavírus ainda não chegou a África, mas os Centros de Controlo e Prevenção de Doenças de África já activaram o seu centro de operações de emergência para enfrentar o vírus e estão organizar um workshop no Senegal para 15 países africanos.\nUma ala de isolamento já está pronta no hospital de Cartum, no Sudão. Laboratórios no Senegal, Nigéria, Gana, África do Sul, Madagáscar ou na Serra Leoa já têm os equipamentos necessários para detectar o vírus. Os passageiros que chegam aos aeroportos dos Camarões ou da Gâmbia estão a ser monitorizados para a febre e outros sintomas virais. Já a República Democrática do Congo tem impedido os seus cidadãos de viajar para a China. O Burkina Faso pediu aos cidadãos chineses para adiarem as suas viagens.

SINGAPORE — A link between two Covid-19 church clusters, where the source of infection had previously eluded the authorities, was finally established. This was done through a serological test, a new testing method developed by Duke-NUS Medical School.  \n The test is able to detect past infections in someone who has recovered from it. Individuals who had contracted the coronovirus before will have high levels of virus-specific antibodies in their blood which can be picked up by this test.   \n The authorities ran this test on Case 83, a 54 year-old Singaporean man, and Case 91, a 58-year-old Singaporean woman and the latest case to be announced on Tuesday (Feb 25). They then discovered that both of them had earlier contracted Covid-19 but were not detected at the time. \n They also found that the two, who are married, had a link with another married couple from Wuhan (Cases 8 and 9) who had visited Life Church and Missions Singapore. Both couples were there on the same day on Jan 19. \n Case 91, the wife, developed symptoms on Jan 23 and Case 83, the husband, had symptoms on Jan 28. \n On Jan 25, both of them attended a Chinese New Year gathering on Mei Hwan Drive near Ang Mo Kio Ave 1 which other confirmed cases attended, including Case 66, a 28-year-old Singaporean man who worked at Grace Assembly of God church.  \n On Feb 1, 6 and 10, the wife sought treatment at a general practitioner (GP) clinic. \n At the same time, records also showed that her husband had gone to see a GP repeatedly on Feb 1, 5, 6 and 10.  \n During the period under investigations later, the couple were not sick and did not show symptoms, but records by the Ministry of Health (MOH) showed that the wife had gone to the emergency department of Sengkang General Hospital earlier on Jan 26 with symptoms consistent with Covid-19.  \n She was not marked as a suspect case at the time because she had no recent travel history to China. The case definition has since been expanded to include those who have not been to China in the last 14 days. \n On Feb 18, both of them showed up at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases to undergo tests, including the serological tests. It was then confirmed that they had earlier been infected with the virus. On Feb 19, results showed that the husband had Covid-19 while results for the wife were confirmed on Feb 22. \n Together with help from the police doing contact tracing, the authorities found that the Chinese New Year gathering on Mei Hwan Drive was the common event that this Singaporean couple attended together with Case 66 from the Grace Assembly of God church. \n  Illustration: Samuel Woo/TODAY \n As of Tuesday, there are 23 cases from the Grace Assembly of God cluster — making it the biggest cluster — and seven cases from Life Church and Missions Singapore in Paya Lebar.  \n Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services at MOH, said that the serological tests gave the authorities the confidence to establish that the cases reported at the Grace Assembly of God cluster was not a case of widespread community transmission from other sources. \n Rather, it was a result of a sequential series of events, he said at a media briefing on Tuesday by the multi-ministry task force managing the public health crisis. \n MOH said that the spread between the clusters started with Case 8 (a 56 year-old woman) and Case 9 (a 56 year-old man), who are Chinese nationals.  \n The couple arrived in Singapore on Jan 19 from Wuhan, China — the epicentre of the outbreak.   \n They likely infected the Singaporean couple who went on to pass the infection to Case 66 at the Chinese New Year gathering, the ministry said. Case 66 later passed the infection to his colleagues at Grace Assembly of God church. \n Case 66 was thus found to be the primary case in the Grace Assembly of God cluster.  \n Some people were exposed to him at a staff meeting at the Tanglin branch of the church and they in turn infected other church members, MOH said.  \n Writing on Facebook, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the authorities “discovered an important link” between two existing clusters, including the biggest cluster at Grace Assembly of God.  \n He noted that Cases 83 and 91 had only mild symptoms earlier and had not been diagnosed with Covid-19. But the new serological test later confirmed that they had been infected earlier, and linked the two clusters together.  \n “This breakthrough would not have been possible without close cooperation among the Ministry of Health, Singapore Police Force and researchers from Duke-NUS Medical School, who developed the serological test, the world's first, here in Singapore. My thanks to all of you for a job well done!” he added.  \n "}, {"content": "big read: 17 years on, s’pore puts sars lessons to test in fight against wuhan coronavirus. SINGAPORE — Like many others on the frontline during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003, the resources of a family clinic in Chua Chu Kang had been stretched thin. \n Personal protective equipment — N95 respirators, sterile gloves and full-body gowns — was scarce at a time when the world had never seen a virus like it, and people everywhere were desperately scrambling to stockpile emergency supplies for themselves.  \n Speaking to TODAY, Dr Tan Tze Lee, a general practitioner at the Edinburgh Clinic, recalled the difficulties that frontline healthcare workers faced when procuring equipment to protect themselves from the killer virus.  \n By the time Sars was contained in May 2003, it had infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers. \n While Dr Tan’s clinic thankfully encountered no cases, it remained on high alert for Sars patients in the four months of the epidemic in Singapore, throughout which the medical staff had to don full protective gear. But everyone was not ready for the crisis, said Dr Tan, who is also president of the College of Family Physicians Singapore.  \n Many continued to work but were extremely concerned that they might bring the virus home and put their loved ones at risk, he added.  \n “The healthcare practitioners in Singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. Since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event.” \n “Here we are today, ready to fight the 2019-nCoV,” he said. \n The current outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus — or 2019-nCoV, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) temporary name for the virus — was first confirmed in Singapore on Jan 23. To date, all cases were imported, including a Singaporean who was in Wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the Republic.  \n The WHO has yet to declare the virus — which has spread to several countries — as a pandemic. Nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on Friday (Jan 31).  \n The first cases were reported in Wuhan in China’s Hubei province and believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live animals.  \n As of noon on Friday, there were 16 confirmed cases with the virus here, 35 cases were still waiting for their test results and 198 had already tested negative. There are no deaths in Singapore thus far. \n At the heart of the city-state’s response plan is the Disease Outbreak Response System (Dors), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after Sars and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or H1N1) pandemic in 2009.  \n  Medical workers conduct routine checks to guests before the start of an NKF show at a Mediacorp studio as a safety precaution against SARS in 2003. TODAY file photo \n “After Sars, we made a thorough review of the facilities we had – the infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and the scientific testing and capabilities,” said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week.  \n “I think we are much better prepared now.”  \n Currently, Singapore is at Dors condition (Dorscon) Yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The next step up is Dorscon Orange, which would have applied in the case of Sars, whereby the virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. \n While the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, Singapore’s national strategy is still largely untested — since the Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the Republic, medical experts and Sars veterans told TODAY.  \n However, there are ample signs that the lessons from Sars are being applied as Singapore shores up its defences, they said. They believe that unlike during Sars, Singapore is far more ready now. \n LESSONS LEARNT \n Singapore has had two brushes with pandemics in recent memory — Sars and H1N1. \n While Singapore was able to contain and recover from both, the varying nature of the viruses, as well as the changes in medical science, meant that dealing with each required different approaches. \n Doctors had limited options when treating Sars patients and could only administer supportive care, and there was nothing that could be done to prevent infection. In comparison, vaccines and treatment options were available when H1N1 claimed 18 lives in Singapore and infected more than 400,000 people, out of which about 1,300 had to be hospitalised. \n Sars first arrived in Singapore in late February 2003, and was detected in a woman with an atypical pneumonia on March 1, 2003 at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). At the time, no one knew how deadly and virulent it was and the first patient led to a cluster of 42 cases at the hospital.  \n A Ministry of Health (MOH) taskforce was set up on March 15, two weeks after the mysterious strain appeared in Singapore and three days after the WHO issued a global alert on the outbreak that began in Hong Kong. \n But the command and control structure then was “wholly inadequate” in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, a study in the Austrian Journal of South-east Asian Studies concluded in 2012. \n  Church goers being screened for their body temperature by the thermal imaging system at New Creation Church before attending prayers in 2003.

Photos: Najeer Yusof/TODAY \n The structure was led by the health authorities, when in hindsight, it required “more than a medical approach since resources had to be drawn from a number of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the MOH”, said authors Allen Lai and Tan Teck Boon, who were from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \n They noted that it took five weeks after the first case was reported for the bureaucracy to adapt, though by then, the outbreak had already spread quickly out of TTSH.  \n On April 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to Sars, comprising a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng to provide strategic and political directions during health crises. \n Helping to coordinate across silos were a core executive group of senior civil servants, and an operations committee spanning ministries. Their functions were later consolidated during the H1N1 crisis, which meant that this leaner bureaucracy was quicker to respond to emerging situations on the ground. \n With the Wuhan coronavirus, observers told TODAY that it was evident that the Government had reacted more quickly than in Sars and H1N1 when it came to establishing a multi-disciplinary decision-making body.  \n Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the Wuhan coronavirus was formed on Jan 22, several hours before the first suspected case came to the attention of the authorities at 10pm the same day. The patient — a 66-year-old Chinese national tourist from Wuhan — tested positive the next day, becoming the first confirmed case in Singapore. \n “If you look at the response time, it is a fact that the ministerial committee formed before the case appeared, and we can see that a lot of systems are already in place, occurring across ministries and not as siloed as back then when Sars caught us all by surprise,” said Prof Ooi, who is also deputy director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme at Duke-NUS Medical School. \n The taskforce was formed to direct the whole-of-government response to the outbreak, coordinate the public’s response and work with the international community. \n Jointly chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of Cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios. They are: \n Adviser: Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat \n Mr S Iswaran, Minister for Communications and Information \n Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry \n Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources \n Mr Ng Chee Meng, Secretary-General of the National Trades Union Congress \n Mr Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Education \n Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs \n Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for Social and Family Development \n Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Transport, Communications and Information \n Dr Chia Shi-Lu, a Tanjong Pagar GRC Member of Parliament who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, said that this time, the chain of command is clearer. \n He noted that even before the taskforce was formed, the MOH had already begun tracking the outbreak in China at the start of the year. Temperature screening measures were put in place at Changi Airport from as early as Jan 3. \n But the high political signature of the panel had led some to question whether too many cooks were spoiling the broth, Dr Chia noted. “In fact, some have asked me: Are we overdoing it?” he said.  \n “I believe it is very important for everybody to come into the picture — you have to, because at this early stage, (the outbreak) affects so many different parts and you need leadership from them, and you cannot rely solely on MOH to coordinate everything,” he added. \n While information about the Wuhan virus is still emerging, Singapore is not in the same position as in the initial stages of the Sars outbreak in 2003, where it was — in the words of then Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang —“flying blind”.  \n During the Sars crisis, Singapore only had two means to detect those infected with the virus: Their clinical symptoms and their travel history. Detecting these were not easy at the time as temperature screeners were also a rare resource, unlike today. \n “We have to depend on people taking temperature, and we have to depend on people being truthful to us in their contact history,” said Mr Lim then, describing Sars as a tremendous challenge. \n Dr Tan Yia Swam, First Vice-President of the Singapore Medical Association (SMA), said that in the Sars crisis, “there were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly”. Sars was zoonotic in nature, with the disease starting in animals before spreading to humans.  \n As a result, policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said. \n “Today, all of the above have been developed and tested before in exercises and they are now put into action. Of course, these plans, policies and procedures must be modified in line with the epidemiology of the disease, but we are not working from scratch, unlike the past experience with Sars,” she added.  \n  Tan Tock Seng Hospital's moderate risk area during the 2003 Sars period. TODAY file photo \n   Notices at Tan Tock Seng Hospital informing visitors and patients of the Wuhan coronavirus. Photos: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n Addressing the media on Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong said that in the taskforce’s national response to the virus, it is able to “marshal all available resources” to tackle the scourge. \n In terms of capacity, Singapore has already beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003. This includes the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases that opened last year, and new hospitals such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in 2010, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in 2015, and Sengkang General Hospital in 2018, he said. \n During Sars, TTSH was known as “Sars Central”, the designated hospital to handle patients. This was borne out of a policy to restrict transmission of the virus to other hospitals, after a patient — who was unaware that he had been infected with the virus during his stay in TTSH — created a new viral cluster at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) when he went there for a surgical problem after his discharge from TTSH.  \n This policy changed in 2009 during the H1N1 outbreak, with the Health Ministry imposing a standardised infection control measure on all healthcare facilities, empowered by timely tweaks to the Infectious Diseases Act. More than 400 family clinics were made “H1N1-ready” and equipped with the Tamiflu vaccine to handle the outbreak. \n Similarly, all public hospitals are capable of handling the Wuhan virus today, and come equipped with isolation rooms, which were in short supply in 2003.  \n When it came to medical supplies, Dr Chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as N95 respirators. \n “Because an N95 mask needs to fit well for it to perform its function, having a properly fitted mask was (hard to come by) during Sars, and we had to find time to do the fitting too,” said Dr Chia, who was an orthopaedic surgeon at SGH at the height of the crisis.  \n “Today, most of us are already fitted with our own personal equipment, even as new staff. Everything is in place today,” he said. \n Visitors, staff and patients entering Gleneagles Hospital will have to undergo a screening at the entrance. Photo: Justin Ong/TODAY \n For the general public, the Government will be disbursing a pack of four surgical masks to each of the 1.37 million Singapore households in a one-off exercise between Feb 1 and Feb 9. This was also done in 2003 when all households received a free emergency kit, containing N95 masks and themometers. \n This time round, the mask distribution comes amid long queues at pharmacies around the island as people clamour to buy masks, and retailers say their stocks of surgical masks and N95 masks are running low or sold out. The Government had released 5 million masks from its stockpile over nine days to the retailers but they were all snapped up in hours.  \n Said Dr Chia: “The message is that there is enough for the whole of the population and in reserve too.” \n SMA’s Dr Tan said his association met with the College of Family Physicians Singapore over the Chinese New Year weekend to carry out “complex logistics arrangements” to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and N95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers. \n “We are all monitoring the situation closely, and are ready to step up efforts when the need arises,” he said. \n Experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too — student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the Outward Bound Singapore on Pulau Ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site. \n  Nanyang Technological University's Graduate Hall 1, which is designated as a quarantine facility. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n TRICKY BALANCE IN THE FACE OF IMPONDERABLES \n On Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong also called on Singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the Wuhan virus could be worse than Sars given the many “imponderables” and “uncertainties” regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in Singapore. \n Over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of China have surfaced in Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Germany. \n Mr Lawrence Wong said Singapore’s approach “is to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can”. “But every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,” he added.  \n Unlike Sars, which impacted Singapore when little was known about it, there is now a greater understanding about the coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the Wuhan strain and Sars. \n But data gaps still exist, said Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the WHO’s research policy and cooperation department in Geneva.  \n Prof Pangestu told TODAY that not much is known of the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus the severe and fatal ones, which currently makes it difficult to evaluate the Wuhan virus’ true epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response. \n There is also the worry that the virus could mutate into a more virulent and more highly transmissible strain. “This needs close monitoring and another data gap will be in how quickly this development can be evaluated,” he said. \n Despite these gaps, Singapore has “reacted much more swiftly and comprehensively” than in 2003, Prof Pangestu added. \n  With the evolving Wuhan coronavirus situation, people are taking precautions to prevent the spreading of germs by wearing masks. Photo: Najeer Yusof/TODAY \n A rule of thumb for any country’s approach in health crises, he said, is to base decisions on scientific evidence and rational analysis in the context of its own capacities.  \n “I think the Singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available — robust but not over-reactive and flexible enough to accommodate new developments,” said Prof Pangestu.  \n He noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. Underreaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus. \n “Calibrating the balance is tricky, but as I said, base your decisions on the existing scientific evidence,” said Prof Pangestu. \n Prof Ooi from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health added: “There is a risk and cost to overreaction and a cost to underreaction. Nobody knows what is the right answer and there is no hard science to it — this is a judgement call and there is no right or wrong.” \n Where there is a dearth of knowledge on imported pandemic cases, Singapore’s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances, and the plan recommends taking border control measures that would “err on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer”.  \n Addressing the media on Friday, Mr Lee said: “I think as a Government, in a way, we are overreacting because we are trying to look ahead to see what can go wrong and take preemptive steps to prevent that from happening.” \n Within a week, the taskforce moved from allowing travellers from Wuhan to enter Singapore while subject to enhanced screening on Monday, to imposing a complete entry ban on all nationalities who have been to China in the past 14 days on Friday. \n The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority has also stopped issuing all forms of new visas to those with People’s Republic of China passports. \n HANDLING A PSYCHOLOGICAL CRISIS  \n Although the memory of Sars may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more Singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis.  \n For example, social media is rife with examples of Singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. The Government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour.   But Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, believes that the Sars legacy can also be a double-edged sword: The prospect of another Sars-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, “kiasuism”.  \n  Surgical masks sold out at Guardian Pharmacy at Changi Airport on Jan 29, 2020. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n In a viral outbreak, being  “kiasu” means that people only think for themselves, preventing mutual cooperation from happening, he said. \n Urging Singaporeans to do better, Dr Leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. If fear and panic take hold, they can overwhelm the country’s response “like a tsunami”, he said.  \n This means Singapore’s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said. \n “You have no time to get ready. Better to be ready (for the worst) now than not ready at all… There is little room for mistakes (that create more panic),” said Dr Leong. \n Dr Chia believes that Singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an MP or his interactions with patients. \n “During Sars, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone. We had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening… But so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among Singaporeans,” he said. \n The rise of social media, which was non-existent during Sars, can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic. \n On the threat of fake news, SMA’s Dr Tan said: “Social media may do more harm than good in this kind of situation where fake news may spread faster than a virus and trigger unwanted behaviours. We urge all readers to exercise judgement when reading stories from various sources, and to keep referencing to official websites for accurate information.” \n STRONGER LEGISLATION  \n Compared with the Sars crisis, Singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour — the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act being one of them. \n Lesser known are the many enhancements to the Infectious Diseases Act over the years since 2003, which give the authorities greater powers to enforce orders that were issued in the fight against a gazetted outbreak. \n The Act allows people who break home quarantine orders to be arrested without a warrant and to be jailed or fined on conviction. It was amended last year to allow officers to use “physical means” to enforce the order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation, in lieu of arrest. \n It also makes explicit that persons under legal orders that restrict their movement in Singapore, would not be allowed to leave the country, unless otherwise permitted. \n The breadth of such powers in Singapore gives the authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics, such as those described by Dr Chia, cannot happen again. The issue became such a problem during the Sars crisis that the health authorities had to resort to draconian measures, such as installing video surveillance cameras in the homes of people who were ordered to be quarantined.  \n The lack of legal powers has created some difficulties for several foreign governments in dealing with the Wuhan coronavirus. Earlier this week, two Japanese citizens who were brought back to Japan from Wuhan on a chartered flight declined to go for medical screening when they landed in Tokyo. \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the Japanese Parliament: \"While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so.\" \n MORAL SUASION AND IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC COMMS  \n But over the longer term, evidence suggests that government measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions are not as effective as instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people. \n Having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when the authorities need the people’s support to carry out certain measures, noted Prof Pangestu. \n  ​Preschool children getting their health checked by teachers at My First Skool at Buangkok Crescent on Jan 28, 2020. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n Prof Pangestu said: “You need the public’s cooperation for your measures to be successful, such as to follow good hygiene practices, be alert to any symptoms, promptly seeking healthcare, awareness of potential risks, and to counter the spread of misinformation on social media.”  \n This will be critical during the “surge response”— when situational changes cause a sudden need for the authorities to ramp up its measures, such as activating quarantine sites that are being held in reserve. \n A lack of moral suasion would erase the ability for the Government to implement these measures, experts said. They noted how in Hong Kong, protestors bombed a general hospital and a residential building that the authorities had wanted to use as a possible quarantine facility. \n Over the past week, South Korean protesters — mostly residents — also used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, which are about 80km from Seoul. \n Experts said cooperation from the masses largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation that can lead to miscommunication.  \n An April 2003 article in The Straits Times, \"All the right moves for Sars but info’s a bit slow, no?\", by its then news editor Bertha Henson, described how the MOH was asked at a press conference to confirm a tipoff that SGH nurses might have Sars. The authorities said no, but it later emerged the next day that 21 SGH staff were on the Sars suspect list. \n “The kindest thing I can say about this sudden announcement is that the ministry gets its information later than the media,” wrote Ms Henson then. \n Referring to the incident, Professor Chee Yam Cheng, the current president of the Singapore Medical Council, wrote in a series of memos about Sars in 2003 that “quick dissemination of information — and accurate information — is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency”. \n Prof Pangestu believes that in general, Singaporeans are united and support what the Government is trying to do to contain the situation. \n “But public reaction is hard to control especially with fake news on social media. The idea that ‘perception is reality, anything is the truth’ often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment. That is why public risk communication is so important,” he said. \n "}, {"content": "Covid-19. Bruxelas apoia repatriamento de cidadãos da UE em cruzeiro no Japão.

PARIS/WASHINGTON - Business activity collapsed from Australia, Japan and Western Europe to the United States at a record pace in March as measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic hammer the world economy, cementing economists' views of a deep global recession.  \n The highly contagious coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, has caused entire regions to be placed on lockdown and in some places soldiers are patrolling the streets to keep consumers and workers indoors, halting services and production and breaking supply chains.  \n \"The global health crisis is rapidly morphing into a global recession, as there is a clear tension between preventing infections and ruining the economy,\" said Edoardo Campanella, an economist at UniCredit Bank in Milan. \"However, a wise policy coordination between health and fiscal authorities should allow a V-shaped recovery once containment measures are relaxed.\"  \n Data firm IHS Markit said on Tuesday its flash U.S. Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, dropped to a reading of 40.5 this month. That was an all-time low and followed a reading of 49.6 in February.  \n Last month's decline in the index, which is seen as a good measure of economic health, was the largest in the series' history. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in business activity. The survey underscored the rapidly deteriorating economy, highlighted last week by a government report showing the biggest rise since 2012 in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits during the week ended March 14.  \n Economists are predicting claims will accelerate to a record 1.5 million or more when data for last week is published on Thursday.  \n The message was equally grim from the 19 countries that use the euro. IHS Markit's flash composite PMI for the euro zone plummeted to a record low of 31.4 in March.  \n That was by far the biggest one-month fall since the survey began in mid-1998 and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which gave a median prediction of 38.8.  \n In France, services activity fell to a record low and manufacturing saw its steepest drop since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.  \n A PMI for the services sector in Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed a record contraction in activity, while sister surveys showed Britain's economy shrinking at a record pace.  \n IHS Markit said the March figures suggested the euro zone economy was shrinking at a quarterly rate of around 2%, and the escalation of measures to contain the virus could steepen the downturn.  \n With most asset markets tanking, global central banks have been rolling out extraordinary measures on an almost daily basis to stop the rot. But some analysts say infinite monetary policy easing may not be enough and fiscal steps are crucial.  \n There was some optimism on that front, with senior Democrats and Republicans saying on Tuesday they were close to reaching a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus package to aid the U.S. economy.  \n Hopes for a large fiscal stimulus sparked a sharp rebound in global stock markets, with the Dow Jones <.DJI> raking up its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933. (Graphic: Coronavirus pandemic hits global business - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3868/3829/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES  \n After an initial outbreak in China brought the world's second-largest economy to a virtual halt last month, an ever-growing number of countries and territories have reported a spike in infections and deaths, leading to \"social distancing\" policies aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19.  \n Goldman Sachs is predicting that the global economy will shrink 1.0% this year, with gross domestic product in China estimated to contract at a 42% annualised rate in the first quarter and GDP in the United States dropping at a record 24% rate in the April-June period.  \n \"The coronacrisis has pushed the world economy into a deep recession,\" said Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius. \"The response to that crisis represents a physical constraint on economic activity that is unprecedented in postwar history.\"  \n The bleak U.S. economic picture ahead of the November presidential election has prompted President Donald Trump to push for businesses to reopen by Easter. Given rising infections and death toll, health experts, economists and politicians have cautioned against such a move, which they say could backfire, with Americans remaining fearful of going out.  \n Trump and Vice President Mike Pence held a conference call with major Wall Street investors on Tuesday.  \n \"Sending the public back to work at this time would be premature,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in New York. \"The U.S. is better off taking a one-time hit to economic growth, as efforts to terminate the virus continue, rather than run the risk of multiple economic shutdowns.\" (Graphic: U.S. stocks have fallen hard - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3867/3828/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n Mirroring the emptying of supermarket shelves around the world, indebted corporates have rushed into money markets to hoard dollars, with a global shortage of dollar funding threatening to cripple firms from airlines to retailers.  \n PMI surveys from Japan showed the services sector shrinking at its fastest pace on record this month and factory activity contracting at its quickest in a decade.  \n This was consistent with a 4% contraction in 2020, Capital Economics senior economist Marcel Theliant said. The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics is expected to deal a heavy blow to the world's third-largest economy.  \n The U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday promised bottomless dollar funding and an array of programs to help keep companies afloat. For the first time, the Fed will back purchases of corporate bonds, backstop direct loans to companies and \"soon\" will roll out a programme to get credit to small and medium-sized businesses. It will also expand its asset purchases by \"as much as needed.\"  \n The Fed last week slashed borrowing costs to zero and took other emergency steps to keep the commercial paper, U.S. Treasury debt and foreign dollar funding markets functional.  \n G7 finance ministers and central bank governors on Tuesday pledged to expand fiscal and monetary actions for as long as necessary to restore growth and confidence.  \n With the International Monetary Fund predicting a global recession, the world's 20 largest economies agreed on Monday to develop an \"action plan,\" but without specifics.

SINGAPORE — The move to impose travel restrictions from coronavirus-hit China could have impacted bilateral relations, which was why Singapore made a “special effort\" to explain why this measure was necessary, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said in Parliament on Monday (March 2). \n Singapore had given Chinese officials a “heads-up” before its public announcement on Jan 31, which had barred any new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China from entering the city-state, said Dr Balakrishnan in the debate on his ministry’s budget. \n He was addressing questions from Mr Vikram Nair, Member of Parliament (MP) for Sembawang Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and Tanjong Pagar GRC MP Joan Pereira on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' efforts during the Covid-19 outbreak. \n In his speech, Dr Balakrishnan said that the disease has now spread globally and that diplomacy was key in coordinating information as well as repatriation missions for Singaporeans, when two flights brought back 266 Singaporeans and their families from Wuhan in China's Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak. \n “Our embassy in Beijing had to coordinate closely with the PRC (People’s Republic of China) and Hubei provincial governments to arrange these repatriation missions,” he said. \n Yet, Singapore was aware that its difficult decision to impose travel restrictions on travellers from mainland China could affect diplomatic relations, Dr Balakrishnan said. \n These measures were not directed at any country, nationality or race, he stressed, adding that stringent measures were necessary to prevent the coronavirus from spreading in Singapore, or being re-exported to other countries. \n In his speech, Mr Sam Tan, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, later explained in Mandarin that high-level officials in China had said that they understood why Singapore had to impose the travel restrictions. \n “When Minister Balakrishnan spoke to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi over the phone early this year, he also thanked the Chinese government for their overwhelming assistance, for letting more than 200  Singaporeans and their families to smoothly leave Wuhan via an airplane and return to Singapore,\" Mr Tan said. \n \"At the same time, we also assisted Chinese citizens stranded in Singapore to return to Wuhan. We must continue to help China during this difficult period of fighting the virus.” \n Dr Balakrishnan said that his Chinese counterpart had “conveyed China’s understanding of the actions we had taken due to the unique circumstances faced by Singapore”. China had also expressed their gratitude for Singapore’s efforts and support during the health crisis. \n Singapore has sent testing equipment and test kits developed here to Wuhan, as well as personal protective equipment and other medical supplies. More than S$6 million were raised by the Singapore Red Cross for affected communities in China, he said. \n Besides China, Dr Balakrishnan said that his ministry has also been working with the international community to tackle Covid-19, including the Special Meeting of the Asean Coordinating Council and the Special Asean-China Foreign Ministers Meeting in Vientiane, Laos last month, where delegates “reaffirmed the importance of openness, decisiveness and co-operation to collectively address the crisis”. \n "}, {"content": "Santa Maria da Feira garante quatro hotéis para profissionais de saúde perto do hospital.

During the recent Chinese New Year celebrations, the Wuhan virus was the hot topic around my family’s dinner table, with many relatives fretting about how virulent the new coronavirus is. I’m sure similar conversations took place across the island. \n Judging by online activities, the virus is the talk of the town. “Wuhan virus” has been a top search term on Google and trending on Twitter for many days now. \n Turn on the television or check out a news website and you will also see plenty of coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus, which the World Health Organisation (WHO) has dubbed 2019-nCoV. \n The outbreak has caused global alarm, and understandably so. It is a new pathogen, and scientists know little about it. \n Fear of the unknown is a very human trait that has helped keep our species alive through the millennia. It keeps us from blundering into potentially dangerous situations without first finding out more about what to expect and how to prepare ourselves. \n But we should also avoid letting our emotions get the better of us. \n Reflexivity — the act of critically examining our own thoughts and feelings — is important. \n Before concluding that the ongoing viral epidemic is a catastrophe, take a step back and understand the reasons why many people are afraid. \n Much of it has to do with the availability heuristic. Heuristics are mental shortcuts our minds use to make thinking faster and less effortful. Unfortunately, they are error-prone. \n The availability heuristic is used when we make judgements about the likelihood of something. Quite often, the judgements we arrive at turn out to be inaccurate. \n A classic example is this: We tend to be afraid of flying in airplanes but not riding in cars. But statistically speaking, we are more likely to die in a car accident than a plane crash. \n Why does the availability heuristic make such mistakes? This is because it judges how likely something is based on how easy it is to think of examples of that thing happening. \n We can think of many examples of fatal plane crashes because such incidents tend to be widely covered by the media. \n But traffic accidents usually go unnoticed because they are an everyday occurrence and the media rarely covers them unless they involve multiple casualties or cause significant damage. \n The influence of the availability heuristic was very apparent in another epidemic — the 2009 swine flu, caused by the Influenza A H1N1 virus. \n I was only 12 then, and I remember how the grownups, their eyes glued to the day’s newspaper, spoke to one another in hushed tones about how bad the pandemic was and how many people were dying. \n Eventually, I caught the bug. But it was nothing a three-day stay in an isolation ward and a brief course of Tamiflu couldn’t fix. \n H1N1 is still around today, but has faded into obscurity. It is now just another flu virus — one of dozens responsible for the seasonal flu. \n Of course, we now know that the 2009 variant of H1N1 was a relatively mild strain. It infected up to 200 million people but its mortality rate was a modest 0.02 per cent. The mortality rate in Singapore was even lower at 0.004 per cent, with 18 fatalities from some 415,000 cases. \n It was a good illustration of how people’s imagined fears, fuelled by media coverage, can make a relatively small problem seem like a huge one thanks to the availability heuristic. \n It’s hard not to overestimate your likelihood of dying from H1N1 if you’re constantly reading reports about how thousands have already succumbed. \n To put the numbers in context, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) viruses — which are cousins of 2019-nCoV — have a 10 per cent and 34 per cent mortality rate respectively. \n The mortality rate of 2019-nCoV itself stands at below 3 per cent for now, though this could change if new information emerges about the virus or if it mutates into a more dangerous form. \n Meanwhile, the humble seasonal flu sickens up to a billion people — equivalent to roughly 15 per cent of the world’s population — every year, killing up to 650,000. \n Although this works out to a mortality rate of less than 1 per cent, the sheer number of cases means that even now, we are far more likely to come down with — and subsequently die from — the regular flu than the Wuhan virus. \n So if you see someone coughing, keep your mind in check. Don’t immediately assume that they have the Wuhan virus. It’s probably just the regular flu. \n And when you are thinking and discussing with others about the outbreak, do your best to seek out the facts and use logical reasoning. \n Because the virus is new and little is known about it, people may fill the void of information with speculation and hearsay. \n It has already happened here. Fake news that individuals had died from the virus in Singapore has circulated on at least two occasions, forcing the Government to debunk the misinformation and even issue a general correction direction through the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act Office. \n It can be very tempting to share such rumours with family and friends, because they are dramatic and prey on our emotions. \n But apply some media literacy techniques first, before deciding whether to press the “send” button. \n Read about past epidemics and how viruses work on free information platforms like Wikipedia. Consume news from multiple outlets so you can corroborate the facts across different sources. \n As Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Jan 27 at a press conference about the Wuhan virus situation in Singapore: “This is not just a fight on the medical front, but a fight on the psychological front. We have to stay together, and do not panic.” \n In short, let’s not scare ourselves unnecessarily, and refrain from scaring one another too. \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Jonathan Tiong is a fourth-year student at the National University of Singapore where he is majoring in Communications and New Media. \n "}, {"content": "Work to start on three possible China virus vaccines: epidemic response group.

LONDON - Extending school and work closures at the coronavirus' ground zero in China may delay a second wave of infections, researchers said on Thursday, urging the rest of the world to take note.  \n With containment measures largely successful and the epidemic's epicentre now in Europe, China has loosened a two-month lockdown in the city of Wuhan where the new coronavirus is thought to have jumped from wildlife to people late last year.  \n But a study in The Lancet Public Health journal suggested continuing Wuhan's shutdowns until April would push a potential second wave of COVID-19 - the disease caused by the new virus - until later in the year. That would give health services more time to recover and expand, potentially saving lives.  \n \"The city now needs to be really careful to avoid prematurely lifting physical distancing measures, because that could lead to an earlier secondary peak in cases,\" said Kiesha Prem, a specialist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), who co-led the research.  \n \"If they relax the restrictions gradually, this is likely to both delay and flatten the peak.\"  \n The study used mathematical modelling to simulate either extending or relaxing school and workplace closures in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people whose name has become synonymous with the coronavirus for much of the world.  \n By lifting control measures now, a second rush of infections may occur in late August, the analysis suggested. But keeping lockdown measures until April would likely delay a second peak until October — giving healthcare workers a chance to regroup.  \n  \n RESURGENCE FEARS  \n Those findings were \"crucial for policy makers everywhere\", said Tim Colbourn, an expert in global health epidemiology at University College London, who was not directly involved in the study.  \n Stunned by the disease's rapid spread, governments around the world are trying to replicate China's draconian lockdown measures while also working out the risk of recurrences once the epidemic peaks have passed in their countries.  \n \"Our results won't look exactly the same in another country,\" said Yang Liu, an LSHTM expert who also worked on the research. \"But we think one thing probably applies everywhere: physical distancing measures are very useful, and we need to carefully adjust their lifting to avoid subsequent waves of infection ... If those waves come too quickly, that could overwhelm health systems.\"  \n World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday expressed the same view, saying lockdowns were the best way to curb transmission.  \n \"The last thing any country needs is to open schools and businesses only to be forced to close them again because of a resurgence,\" he said.

BEIJING/WASHINGTON/NEW YORK - China is withdrawing the press credentials of American journalists at three U.S. newspapers, intensifying a bitter fight between the world's top two economies that has widened to include the coronavirus outbreak and media freedoms.  \n Beijing announced on Wednesday what it said was retaliation against U.S. restrictions on Chinese journalists that includes revoking the accreditations of American correspondents with the New York Times <NYT.N>, News Corp's <NWSA.O> Wall Street Journal and Washington Post whose credentials expire by the end of 2020.  \n The move is a sharp escalation of a dispute that saw Washington last month force Chinese state media firms to register as foreign embassies.  \n Beijing then expelled three Wall Street Journal correspondents - two Americans and an Australian - following an opinion column by the newspaper that called China the \"real sick man of Asia.\"  \n Washington then slashed the number of journalists permitted to work in the United States at four major Chinese state-owned media outlets to 100, from 160 previously. It cited a \"deepening crackdown\" on independent reporting inside China.  \n Beijing said the expelled journalists would not be permitted to work in mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. It said they must hand back their press cards within 10 days.  \n The expulsion is expected to affect at least 13 journalists, according to the Foreign Correspondents Club of China, which said it \"deplores\" China's decision.  \n China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on how many journalists are affected.  \n Beijing also said the China branches of the three papers plus the Voice of America broadcaster and Time magazine must \"declare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in China.\"  \n  \n WAR OF WORDS  \n The latest development follows a war of words between Washington and Beijing over the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which causes a highly contagious, sometimes fatal, respiratory illness COVID-19.  \n The virus originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has so far killed 7,400 people globally, bringing normal life in many parts of the world to a standstill.  \n U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at a State Department news conference that Beijing's move on Wednesday would deprive the world and the Chinese people of information in \"incredibly challenging\" times brought about by the coronavirus.  \n \"I regret China's decision today to further foreclose the world's ability to conduct the free press operations that frankly would be really good for the Chinese people,\" he said. \"This is unfortunate... I hope they'll reconsider.\"  \n Media executives denounced the move.  \n \"We unequivocally condemn any action by China to expel U.S. reporters,\" Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron said in a statement. \"The Chinese government's decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to COVID-19 is essential.\"  \n Dean Baquet, executive editor at The New York Times, also condemned the decision.  \n \"It is a grave mistake for China to move backwards and cut itself off from several of the world's top news organizations,\" he said.  \n Matt Murray, editor in chief at The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires, said: \"We oppose government interference with a free press anywhere in the world. Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged.\"  \n Time Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal said: \"We oppose any effort by the Chinese government or any other government to expel reporters or intimidate those whose job is to provide accurate information, especially during this crucial period for the world.\"  \n A representative of Voice of America was not immediately reachable.  \n  \n 'ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS'  \n A striking aspect of Beijing's move was its decision to bar the journalists from working in Hong Kong and Macau, two semi-autonomous territories of China with their own media accreditation rules. In the past, foreign journalists kicked out of China were allowed to work in Hong Kong.  \n That raised questions about Hong Kong's autonomy under the \"one country, two systems\" agreement that still prevails between the territory and the mainland.  \n \"There's no precedent for China dictating who can and can’t report from Hong Kong openly,\" said Steven Butler, the Committee to Protect Journalists' Asia programme coordinator. \"It very seriously erodes Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedom of the press.\"  \n The Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Hong Kong said it was alarmed at the decision to expel the journalists and even more concerned that they would be banned from working as journalists in Hong Kong.  \n It said Hong Kong must provide assurances that foreign journalists working in Hong Kong and those applying to work in the city will continue to be issued employment visas without interference from the Chinese government.  \n Beijing said on Wednesday that its actions \"are entirely necessary and reciprocal countermeasures that China is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organizations experience in the United States.\"  \n Pompeo said he did not think Beijing's latest move was a balanced response. \"This isn't apples to apples,\" he said, charging that the Chinese journalists who had faced restrictions were part of \"propaganda outlets.\"  \n China has repeatedly denounced the Wall Street Journal's \"sick man\" column as racist and, after the newspaper declined to apologise, revoked the visas of the three reporters in Beijing. Another reporter with the paper had to leave last year after China declined to renew his visa.

A Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) anunciou esta terça-feira que a epidemia do novo coronavírus que surgiu na China não é ainda uma pandemia. “Actualmente, não estamos em situação de pandemia”, termo que se aplica a uma situação de disseminação global de uma doença, disse  Sylvie Briand, directora do departamento de preparação global para os riscos infecciosos da OMS.\n\"Estamos numa fase epidémica com múltiplos surtos”, acrescentou a responsável à imprensa. O termo pandemia é usado para descrever situações em que uma doença infecciosa ameaça muitas pessoas em simultâneo e em todo o mundo.\nSylvie Briand enfatizou também que se verifica actualmente uma “epidemia de informação”, uma “infodemic” que pode dificultar a resposta à epidemia de coronavírus. \nA responsável da OMS recordou que o berço da epidemia foi a província de Hubei, no centro da Cinha. “A transmissão de homem para homem é intensa e as autoridades chinesas adoptaram medidas” para limitar a propagação da doença. \n“Esperamos que, com base nessas medidas tomadas em Hubei, mas também em outros lugares em que tivemos casos, possamos parar a transmissão e livrar-nos desse vírus”. É um “desafio”, frisou.  “Não estou a dizer que é fácil, mas (...) achamos que é possível”.\nA responsável da OMS revelou ainda que estão marcadas reuniões com representantes do sector do turismo para estabelecer medidas de protecção para quem viaja.  \nDepois ter declarado na passada quinta-feira o novo coronavírus como uma situação de emergência de saúde pública de âmbito internacional, o que pressupõe a adopção de medidas de prevenção e coordenação à escala mundial, a OMS lembrou que o uso de máscaras não protege totalmente do vírus, mas acrescentou que quem já estiver infectado não deve dispensar o seu uso.\nO novo coronavírus (2019-nCoV), que surgiu em Dezembro passado em Wuhan, capital da província de Hubei, já provocou 427 mortos e infectou mais de 20.400 pessoas.\nAlém do território continental da China e das regiões chinesas de Macau e Hong Kong, há mais casos de infecção confirmados em 23 outros países, segundo a organização.\n"}, {"content": "Covid-19. Como uma pandemia mundial pode criar um “pandemónio” político. A propagação do Covid-19 e a iminência de uma pandemia de grandes dimensões pode afetar a geopolítica mundial e está a colocar governos perante problemas sociais de difícil resolução. Os analistas ouvidos pela agência Lusa acreditam que uma pandemia pode criar situações de \"pandemónio\" e sublinham que vários governantes temem a repercussão social da propagação incontrolada do vírus numa \"aldeia global\" onde os fenómenos não reconhecem fronteiras.\nUm caso visível dessa preocupação é o Presidente norte-americano: preocupado com o impacto do novo coronavírus na sua tentativa de reeleição, em novembro próximo, Trump impediu um cidadão dos EUA, que fora infetado no navio Diamond Princess, no Japão, de ser tratado no seu Estado natal de Alabama, telefonando ao senador Republicano Richard Shelby, para que se assegurasse do cumprimento da sua instrução.\nOs analistas dizem que o impacto do Covid-19 nas eleições norte-americanas pode ser uma \"faca de dois gumes\": numa primeira hipótese, a economia dos EUA é afetada a longo prazo, fragilizando a posição de Trump, que tem usado a bandeira do desempenho económico; num segundo cenário, o surto tem uma curta duração, afetando a produção de bens durante alguns meses, com a oferta a retomar na véspera da eleição, de forma compactada, favorecendo a posição de Trump.\nDe acordo com o jornal norte-americano Politico, Trump já pediu aos seus conselheiros para analisarem todos os cenários e solicitou um relatório pormenorizado sobre medidas de emergência ao Centro de Controlo e Prevenção de Doenças (CDC). O CDC, num documento tornado público, alertou o Presidente norte-americano sobre o risco de \"o sistema de saúde pública ficar sobrelotado, com elevadas taxas de hospitalização e mortes\", alertando ainda para o impacto de uma pandemia nos sistemas de transportes.\nO problema é global e a grande variável é saber qual a dimensão que ele vai atingir, diz José Pedro Teixeira Fernandes, investigador do Instituto Português de Relações Internacionais (IPRI-Nova). Em declarações à Lusa, este especialista alerta para os riscos que os governos correm, se uma pandemia se espalha durante longos períodos de tempo.\n\"O problema é de grau\", explica Teixeira Fernandes, referindo-se a uma situação que pode envolver muitos milhares de infetados num mesmo país, durante um longo período, afetando não apenas os serviços de saúde, mas também as cadeias de fornecimento de bens essenciais.\nPara já, na Europa, onde os casos de infeção começam a multiplicar-se em várias regiões, os governos procuram mecanismos de contenção da doença, acionando mecanismos administrativos de isolamento do vírus.\nMesmo em França, onde há uma forte tradição de direitos individuais - que impossibilitam, por exemplo, que uma pessoa que decida desaparecer não possa ser procurada pela polícia, mesmo sob pretexto de \"interesse familiar\" - o Governo anunciou que irá proceder à obrigatoriedade de internamento para as pessoas infetadas.\nO tema do internamento obrigatório de um doente infetado com um vírus altamente contagioso está a ser discutido em vários países, incluindo Portugal, onde os especialistas se dividem na leitura jurídica das soluções.\nConstantino Sakellarides, especialista em Saúde Pública e que foi responsável da Direção-Geral de Saúde em Portugal, afirmou que a lei portuguesa permite a quarentena obrigatória de um doente infetado com vírus e prevê mesmo a possibilidade de se declarar o estado de calamidade, que deverá ser proposto pelo Governo ao Presidente da República.\nEm sentido contrário, Francisco George, que também foi diretor-geral de Saúde, considera que será necessário fazer alterações à Constituição para instituir o internamento obrigatório por razões de saúde pública. \"Em Portugal, é altura de deputados da Assembleia da República alterarem a alínea h) do número 3, do artigo 27.º da Constituição, no sentido de passar a ser permitido o internamento obrigatório por motivos de Saúde Pública. Inadiável\", escreveu Francisco George, num artigo de opinião recentemente divulgado no diário Público.\nCaroline Barnett, professora de Saúde Pública na Universidade de Paris, diz que o risco deste género de medida aumenta com a dimensão do problema. \"O problema é quando o Estado procura o internamento obrigatório de centenas ou milhares de pessoas, muitas vezes sem assegurar as devidas condições para todos esses internamentos\", disse Barnett à Lusa, referindo-se a um cenário que poderá ocorrer em vários países, a curto prazo.\nPara esta especialista, uma situação incontrolada de propagação de vírus pode levar a um \"pandemónio\" político, com diversos governos a ter de reconhecer a incapacidade para lidar com milhares de mortos e sistemas de saúde deficitários nos meios para acolher milhões de infetados.\nNa Europa, a Comissão Europeia procura soluções menos intrusivas do que o internamento obrigatório, com mecanismos de isolamento da propagação do vírus que evitem a necessidade de internamento compulsivo, nomeadamente através da ativação da \"pool\" de Proteção Civil Europeia - uma organização estabelecida para agilizar uma coordenação de esforços entre os países membros para resposta rápida a catástrofes.\nUma relevante decisão política na comunidade europeia diz respeito ao encerramento de fronteiras no espaço Schengen, que a Comissão Europeia disse esta semana não estar ainda a ser considerada. A comissária europeia para a Saúde e Segurança Alimentar, Stella Kyriakides, disse que a Organização Mundial de Saúde não aconselhou restrições na Europa, para justificar o afastamento desta solução.\nJosé Pedro Teixeira Fernandes lembra que uma medida desse género vai contra o próprio espírito de Schengen, mas reconhece que uma situação de emergência a pode justificar, durante um curto período de tempo.\nOs governos de Itália e França, cujos países fazem fronteira, anunciaram que estão atentos a esta possibilidade, depois de as províncias italianas de Lombardia e Veneto se terem visto fortemente afetadas pela propagação do novo coronavírus. De resto, o primeiro-ministro italiano, Giuseppe Conte, tem sido criticado pelas autoridades regionais pela forma mais relaxada como tem abordado a questão do coronavírus, criticando mesmo decisões locais de encerramentos de escolas e outros espaços públicos.\nConte tentou afastar receios de que o seu Governo não fosse capaz de conter o vírus, depois de ter sido forçado a admitir que um hospital no norte de Itália tinha tratado deficientemente um caso de infeção, contribuindo para a propagação do Covid-19.\nPoliticamente, a fronteira mais delicada é a que separa Itália da Áustria, dois países que estão em confronto aberto à volta da discussão do orçamento europeu e que parecem também ter diferentes visões sobre a melhor forma de conter o coronavírus. O Governo austríaco já deu sinais de que gostaria de ver as fronteiras mais bem vigiadas, mas o Governo italiano já disse que não vê razões para suspender Schengen, pedindo à Comissão Europeia para libertar rapidamente o fundo de 232 milhões de euros para conter a propagação do Covid-19.\nDiplomaticamente, o problema está também a servir de pretexto para regular o crescente fluxo de turistas chineses em algumas regiões asiáticas. As autoridades de Singapura estão a travar a entrada de chineses no território, depois de o ministro do Negócio e da Indústria deste território ter anunciado que a área de turismo estava excessivamente dependente da China, usando as medidas de proteção contra o vírus para justificar medidas de médio e longo prazo na moderação da sua entrada.\nTeixeira Fernandes recorda que o caso Covid-19 é uma forte ameaça para a posição da China, foco inicial da epidemia, no momento em que está a lançar o seu programa de expansão económica, sobretudo perante os Estados Unidos, com quem mantém uma guerra comercial há quase dois anos.\nO especialista do IPRI-Nova lembra ainda um outro caso de um país em conflito com os Estados Unidos, o Irão, que também está a braços com um grave problema de propagação do vírus, que ficará igualmente fragilizado perante os seus inimigos.\n"}, {"content": "Pesadelo para nós, milagre para o ambiente? Covid-19 pode ter impactos significativos nas emissões de CO2. Meses atrás, ninguém, nem mesmo Greta Thunberg, arriscaria traçar um cenário tão radical: que uma pandemia poderia ser responsável pela maior diminuição das emissões de dióxido de carbono, ao nível mundial, da última década. Ou seja, que uma distopia humanitária se pudesse transformar numa espécie de milagre ecológico.\nCom a quebra no consumo do petróleo, o mundo está a emitir menos um milhão de toneladas de dióxido de carbono por dia. E tudo isto devido ao Covid-19. A Agência Internacional de Energia (AIE) divulgou esta semana um relatório que indica que a procura global de petróleo deve contrair-se este ano pela primeira vez desde 2009.\nDe que a pandemia está a ter impacto no ambiente não há dúvidas. Só na China, local onde o novo coronavírus emergiu, houve, nos últimos meses, uma quebra de 25% nas emissões de CO2 devido às fábricas que encerraram na província de Hubei. Se esta tendência continuar, escrevia o editor de ambiente do “Guardian”, Jonathan Watts, há duas semanas, as emissões mundiais podem cair para valores de 2008/09, antes da crise financeira.\nMesmo a redução drástica das deslocações casa-trabalho e trabalho-casa, um pouco por toda a Europa, não são de descontar na equação. “A ideia de que precisamos de nos deslocar, todos os dias, para um local central para trabalhar pode ser resultado de inércia, mais do que qualquer outra coisa. Confrontados com a necessidade real de nos deslocarmos por via do rato [do computador], em vez do carro, talvez descubramos que os benefícios de flexibilidade laboral se estendem a tudo, desde o consumo de gasolina à necessidade de grandes parques de estacionamento nos escritórios”, disse o ambientalista norte-americano Bill McKibben ao diário britânico.\nTodavia, se é verdade que as emissões – ao nível industrial e da aviação – estão a cair a pique, o aumento do consumo energético dos cidadãos que estão de quarentena pesa também na balança das emissões. “Se vens para uma casa fria e tens de a aquecer, isso vai implicar custos que, em média, não vão compensar a poupança de não ter de conduzir para o trabalho”, explicou Christopher Jones, especialista em políticas climáticas da Universidade da Califórnia, à revista “Scientific American”.\nUma coincidência: em 2016, as Nações Unidas determinaram que o limite que seria imposto às emissões de carbono em voos internacionais teria como base os valores registados no ano de 2020. A expectativa era de a que as companhias aéreas continuassem a crescer – e emissões de CO2 também, claro – e fosse estabelecido assim um teto; desde 2013, as emissões aumentaram 26%, note-se.\nOra, devido ao Covid-19, quase há décadas que não existiam tão poucos aviões no ar, e as emissões eram tão baixas, nota o “Independent”. O tráfego aéreo mundial caiu 4,3% em fevereiro; na China, o número foi mais radical: 70%.\nA pandemia fez cair de forma significativa o volume médio de emissões de CO2. O número de aviões no ar – pelo menos ao nível europeu – é mínimo. “Um possível resultado benéfico do vírus, se conseguirmos ver alguma luz nesta tragédia, é que a linha de base [determinada pela ONU] é 2020 e, neste momento, a aviação é uma espécie de linha-plana”, disse Katherine Kramer, responsável pelas alterações climáticas na associação Christian Aid, no Parlamento britânico, esta quarta-feira.\nOu seja, quando se chegar ao final do ano, se não houver nenhuma mudança no calendário das Nações Unidas, a “linha de base de emissões será muito mais baixa” do que era esperado há quatro anos, explicou. Recorde-se: a aviação é um dos setores que mais contribui para as alterações climáticas: em 2018, voos domésticos e internacionais emitiram cerca de 895 milhões de toneladas de CO2.\n"}, {"content": "Ao contrário de outros países, Portugal não obriga os repatriados a quarentena. Quais os planos para casos de coronavírus?. Ao contrário de vários países, nomeadamente europeus, Portugal não tem prevista uma quarentena automática para os cidadãos repatriados devido ao surto de coronavírus – o que aliás seria inconstitucional, porque só está previsto para casos do foro psiquiátrico. Na Alemanha, Espanha, França e Reino Unido a medida está prevista, se necessário durante 14 dias, o período de incubação da doença até ao aparecimento dos primeiros sintomas.\nEm Espanha, por exemplo, o “El País” já avançou que a quarentena será cumprida no Hospital Central Gómez Ulla, em Madrid, onde está reservado um piso completo. No Reino Unido, Matt Hancock, o secretário da Saúde, já avisou: “A segurança pública é a nossa prioridade. Quem regresse de Wuhan será isolado durante 14 dias, com todos os cuidados médicos necessários”.\nApesar de não estar prevista a obrigatoriedade da quarentena, a ministra da Saúde afirmou esta quinta-feira que os portugueses a retirar da China serão rastreados antes de iniciarem a viagem e na chegada ao aeroporto. Marta Temido acrescentou que Portugal ainda estuda a hipótese de um espaço de confinamento, \"seja no domicílio ou noutro tipo de espaço\", o que depende da “condição clínica destas pessoas e do seu historial anterior\".\nO plano de contingência que está acionado em três hospitais portugueses implica equipamento de proteção individual, espaços e meios alocados e articulação com o INEM para a receção dos eventuais contaminados, apurou o Expresso junto das unidades de saúde.\nFace à progressão da epidemia, foi já na semana passada que a Direção-Geral de Saúde designou os hospitais de São João, no Porto, e o Curry Cabral e o Estefânia, em Lisboa, como os destinos para potenciais infetados. A responsabilidade dos hospitais apenas se dá com a chegada dos doentes à unidade hospitalar.\n“O transporte destes doentes (casos suspeitos ou confirmados) deverá ser feito pelo INEM, que dispõe dos meios adequados”, explica o Hospital de São João. Aliás, fonte da mesma unidade esclarece que apenas será dada resposta a “situações de doença aguda” e que não está previsto que os hospitais sejam um local designado para quarentena de possíveis pacientes.\n“Apenas doentes serão admitidos no internamento do Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João; não temos informação de que esteja previsto o repatriamento de qualquer cidadão português que se encontre doente”, informam.\nDa parte do Curry Cabral, em Lisboa, a informação é a mesma. Ao Expresso, Fernando Maltez, diretor do Serviço de Doenças Infecciosas, reforça que o plano de contingência já elaborado será aplicado apenas a pessoas infetadas ou com suspeitas de infeção. Este plano “contempla o isolamento dessas pessoas em quartos próprios no serviço de doenças infecciosas”. Nesse sentido, foram disponibilizados “14 isolamentos respiratórios de pressão negativa”, utilizados para acolher pacientes com doenças infecciosas.\nMas como o plano de contingência foi “preparado para garantir a segurança quer dos doentes, quer dos profissionais de saúde”, estão previstas outras medidas, como a existência “de circuitos de passagem” distintos e a entrega de “equipamentos de proteção individual”, como “batas, luvas, máscaras, óculos e toucas”. Está tudo a postos, incluindo no que diz respeito às “terapêuticas e métodos de diagnóstico a implementar”, diz ainda Fernando Maltez.\nNo caso do hospital de São João, no Porto, o plano de prevenção – que será atualizado “conforme conhecimento da evolução da epidemia” – contempla “espaços físicos e meios” específicos que são alocados a esta resposta. Isso inclui médicos, cujo número depende da quantidade de “casos suspeitos ou confirmados” que venham a ser encaminhados e das suas características,”nomeadamente se adultos ou crianças e grau de gravidade”.\nÀ semelhança do que acontecerá no Hospital Curry Cabral, os profissionais de saúde do hospital no Porto que prestam cuidados a estes doentes terão de usar “equipamento de proteção individual apropriado ao tipo e risco de transmissão deste agente” que, “dependendo da atividade que se vai exercer”, irá passar pela utilização de “máscaras, batas, luvas e proteção ocular (óculos ou viseiras).\nApesar de o plano ser específico – por ser um novo vírus e, como tal, com “características próprias” –, o Hospital de São João admite que há pontos de contacto com doenças anteriores, como a gripe das aves ou a gripe A. “Há naturalmente semelhanças com anteriores doenças emergentes na forma como se transmite, como se tem dado a evolução da epidemia e nas implicações em termos de saúde pública e medidas de controlo”, admitem.\nFernando Maltez acrescenta que o Curry Cabral já “ativou vários planos de contingência para outras ameaças de doenças infecciosas” e que estes planos “vão sendo modificados e atualizados”, com alterações ao nível dos equipamentos de proteção individual, como aconteceu com o surto de ébola que teve origem na República Democrática do Congo, “que se transmite por contacto com qualquer fluido orgânico” e não “apenas por via respiratória”, como no caso do coronavírus.\nQuanto às precauções a tomar, o especialista refere que são as mesmas que num caso de gripe, incluindo para as pessoas que convivam com os portugueses que vão ser retirados em breve de Wuhan – tudo indica que já esta sexta-feira – e colocados sob vigilância em casa por um período de 14 dias, mediante uma análise caso a caso.\n“Estes cidadãos não precisam de permanecer sozinhos em casa, podendo conviver com familiares e amigos desde que usem máscara e lavem as mãos. Aqueles que convivem com eles também têm de fazer o mesmo”, ressalvou.\nOs sintomas do coronavírus são parecidos aos de uma gripe, mas mais intensos: febre, dor, mal-estar geral e dificuldades respiratórias, incluindo falta de ar.\n"}, {"content": "FOREX-Yen holds gains on virus woes, euro crumbles on weak growth outlook.

India is awaiting permission to airlift over 100 more.\nBarely three hours after the notice was issued, the government announced that the decision had been retracted saying it was issued by a subordinate working group of the city's disease control command without their superiors' approval, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.\nThe disease control command said it would reprimand the officials who issued the order without approval.\nThe evacuation has evoked hope for many as no residents were allowed to leave the city since then, including several hundred foreigners, mainly students.\nMeanwhile, the death toll climbed to 2,592 with 150 new fatalities while the total number of confirmed cases increased to over 77,000, health officials said on Monday.\nChina's National Health Commission (NHC) said it received reports of 409 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection and 150 deaths from 31 provincial-level regions on Sunday.\nThe overall confirmed cases in the mainland China has reached 77,150 with a total of 2,592 fatalities by the end of Sunday, the NHC said.\nHubei province and its capital Wuhan, the ground zero of the virus, continued to bear the brunt with 149 death while one person died in Hainan province, it said.\nThe NHC also highlighted that recovered coronavirus patients have outnumbered new infections for the sixth consecutive day, indicating stabilisation of the virus situation in China.\nSunday saw 1,846 people walk out of hospital after recovery, much higher than the number of the same day's new confirmed infections which was 409, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.\nA total of 24,734 patients infected with the coronavirus have been discharged from hospital after recovery by the end of Sunday, the NHC said.\nIn an unprecedented move, China on Monday postponed the annual session of Parliament from March 5 due to the virus outbreak.\nThe country's top legislature, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), met here and approved a draft decision on postponing the NPC's annual session due to coronavirus, China Global Television Network TV reported.\nEvery year, the NPC and the top advisory body Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which together have over 5,000 members in their ranks, meet during March to approve the government's annual agenda including the budget.\nMeanwhile, the China-World Health Organisation (WHO) joint expert team visited Hubei over the weekend to conduct field investigations, the NHC said.\nThe experts visited Tongji Hospital, the Wuhan Sports Centre that was converted into a temporary hospital, and the provincial centre for disease control and prevention to learn about the epidemic prevention and control as well as medical treatment, it said.\nThey also talked to the officials and experts in the province and briefed NHC director Ma Xiaowei on their findings and suggestions, it said.\nMeanwhile, the Chinese Foreign Ministry resumed its regular press conferences in its premise doing away with the three-week-long online briefing through social media app weChat, in an apparent effort to show that things are returning to normalcy.\nCorrespondents were allowed to attend the press conference after furnishing health reports and temperature checks.\nThe briefing was conducted by Foreign Ministry's new spokesman Zhao Lijian, former Deputy Ambassador to Pakistan.\nPresident Xi Jinping, who presided over a high-level meeting of officials on Sunday to review the progress of his government's efforts to contain the virus, warned that the epidemic is still 'grim and complex' and called for more efforts to tackle the country's 'largest public health emergency'.\nXi said the virus outbreak is a major public health emergency that has spread in the fastest speed, caused the most extensive infection and is the most difficult to contain in the country since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.\n\"This is both a crisis and a big test for us,\" Xi said, adding that after arduous work, the positive trend in the prevention and control work is now expanding.\n\"It has been proven that the CPC (Communist Party of China) Central Committee's judgment on the situation of the epidemic is accurate, all work arrangements are timely, and the measures taken are effective,\" Xi said defending his government's approach to contain the virus.\n\"The results of the prevention and control work have once again demonstrated the notable advantages of the leadership of the CPC and the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics,\" state-run Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying.\n"}, {"content": "From growth to coronavirus concern: Key takeaways from RBI's monetary policy review. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday kept the key interest rate unchanged at 5.15 per cent in what seemed to be a widely expected move.\nRBI Governor Shaktikanta Das spoke about several issues affecting the Indian economy including negative output gap and shared a fresh growth projection for the next fiscal.\nHe also explained why the six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to go forward with an accommodative stance.\nOther than that, the MPC also expressed concerns over inflation and gave a higher projection. But it said it would ensure that inflation remains within its fresh target.\nOn the recent budget announcements, RBI said income tax concessions under the new optional regime will help boost domestic demand and welcomed the government’s infrastructure push.\nShaktikanta Das also admitted that RBI is concerned about the recent developments on global trade due to the coronavirus outbreak.\nHere are some key takeaways from RBI’s sixth bi-monthly monetary policy review in 2019-20.\nOutput gap negative\nThough RBI expects private consumption to drive growth in the upcoming fiscal, it says the output gap remains negative in the present scenario due to a mix of domestic and global economic factors. While RBI did not opt for a rate cut, Governor Shaktikanta Das said the central bank has enough tools at its disposal to act if economy weakens further.\nFY21 growth outlook\nRBI has estimated GDP growth at 6 per cent for 2020-21. For the first six months of the next fiscal, growth has been predicted at 5.6-6.2 per cent while 6.2 per cent rate has been estimated for the third quarter of FY21. RBI’s projection indicates that an economic recovery can be expected by the second half of 2020-21, given there is a steady decline in inflation and other domestic disturbances.\nBudget commentary\nShaktikanta Das said the RBI welcomed decisions taken by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Budget 2020-21, especially on the tax front and the government’s infrastructure outlay. He said the income tax concessions under the optional income tax rate will boost consumer demand while the infra push was in line with higher rural spending.\nCoronavirus concern \nThe Reserve Bank of India expressed serious concern over the coronavirus outbreak in China with respect to global trade. It said the rapidly spreading virus, which has globally claimed than 500 lives, may even impact India’s economy adversely. However, Governor Das said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak is uncertain till now. He also called for a rapid action plan to deal with the growing trade drawbacks due to the outbreak. In India, there are no new cases of coronavirus after three from Kerala were diagnosed positive. But businesses in India are already facing the heat of the outbreak. The diamond industry in Surat says it could lose business up to Rs 8,000 crore as key markets continue to remain shut. Companies from all sectors who import materials from China are also facing the heat.\nInflation projection hiked\nRBI continues to remain worried about inflation, especially since demand for food commodities have increased globally after the coronavirus outbreak. RBI has projected CPI inflation upwards to 6.5 per cent for the present quarter and 5.4 per cent for the first half of FY21, which is expected to go down to 3.21 per cent in the third quarter of FY21. While inflation projection has been increased from the earlier policy review, inflation is expected to come down as a result of falling vegetable prices, especially onions. A better Rabi sowing season may also contain inflation.\nDon’t Discount RBI \nRBI said its policy stance should not be seen as a future policy action and that it has many ways of tackling economic growth when required. Shaktikanta Das said RBI will continue to maintain an accommodative stance, indicating that it will act whenever necessary to beat slowdown. Have many instruments at our disposal to address slowdown, Das said.\nSmall saving schemes interest rates \nThe RBI’s MPC also indicated that there is a need for adjustment in interest rates for small savings schemes. Small savings school include the Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC) and others. It remains to be seen whether the government acts on the RBI’s advice.\nGood Rabi sowing\nAnother positive mentioned by the MPC is higher Rabi sowing of 9.5 per cent up to January 31. Production of vegetables was also estimated to go up by 2.6 per cent, as per the MPC. This is a good indication as it could lead to moderation in the prices of vegetables.\nBetter indicators \nWhile there are some existing factors that need to be addressed, RBI said there has been an improvement in industrial activity. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), prepared by IHS Markit, rose from 52.7 in December 2019 to 55.3 in January 2020. India’s service sector activity also touched a seven-year high in January, indicating a recovery. Apart from all these factors, RBI said private investment is also likely to grow in the next fiscal.\n"}, {"content": "Covid-19: OMS alerta que jovens “não são invencíveis”.

WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.\nThe American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help.\n“It was heartbreaking to watch,” said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. “If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.”\nZhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.  As an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.\nNo other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.\nZhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to U.S. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.\nQuick left amid a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The U.S. CDC said it first learned of a “cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia” of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31.\nSince then, the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere.\nIn a statement to Reuters, the U.S. CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington’s ability to get information and “had absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.”\nThe agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser “started well before last summer and was due to China’s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.”\nThe CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as “mentors” to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors’ specific role or expertise.\n“CDC has had a 30-year partnership with China CDC and close collaboration,” the statement said. “We had the right staff to engage China and ability to provide technical assistance were it requested.”\nThe CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.\nAsked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country “has adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.”\nOne disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government’s suppression of information.\n“In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn’t have had made a big difference,” Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University. “The problem was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn’t.”\nAlex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS)said Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield’s conversations with “Chinese colleagues.”\nRedfield learned that “this looks to be a novel coronavirus” from Dr. Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Dr. Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,” the official said.\nHHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.\nZhu and other sources said U.S. leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20.\nAfter the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.\nAzar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.\n“Dr. Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,” Azar said. “We made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? What is the severity? What is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?”\nDays later, the World Health Organization secured permission to send a team that included two U.S. experts. The team visited between Feb. 16th and 24th. By then, China had reported more than 75,000 cases.\nOn Feb. 25, the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak at home, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of medical professionals and media.\nRelations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as Trump has labeled the coronavirus the “Chinese virus” - a description the Chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three U.S. news organizations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China.\nThe decision to eliminate Quick’s job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of U.S. staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.\n“We had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,”  the same expert said.\nThe CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move.  “It was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability” it said.\nThe U.S. CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. Coronavirus is not influenza, though it is a respiratory disease.\nThe CDC team, aside from Quick, was housed at U.S. Embassy facilities. No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China’s disease control agency, the sources said.\nChina in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people. Nevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.\nThomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the U.S. resident adviser had still been in China, “it is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.”\nDr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among U.S health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training program.\nYet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.\n“We go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,” Conway said.\nIn 2007, Dr. Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist  and one of the longest serving U.S. officials in the adviser’s position, received China’s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.\nBut since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China’s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.\n“The message from the administration was, ‘Don’t work with China, they’re our rival,’” Frieden said.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Im Vormonat war der Wert um 0,2 Zähler gestiegen.\nAls Grund für die stagnierende Entwicklung nannte das Unternehmen die Verunsicherung durch die Ausbreitung des Coronavirus. Wegen der starken Verflechtung der Wirtschaft könne dies auch Auswirkungen auf Unternehmen in Deutschland haben, sagte GfK-Konsumexperte Rolf Bürkl am Donnerstag in Nürnberg.\n„Wenn die Belieferung mit Vorprodukten oder Zulieferteilen aus China unterbrochen wird, dann wirkt das negativ auf die Beschäftigung bei uns. Drohende Kurzarbeit und Arbeitsplatzverluste drücken dann die Verbraucherstimmung“, erklärte er.\nAuch für deutsche Exporte nach China habe das Coronavirus möglicherweise negative Effekte. „Die Wachstumsprognosen werden in China deutlich zurückgenommen. Auch die Kaufkraft ist in dem Maße nicht mehr vorhanden - das betrifft natürlich auch Deutschland als Exportnation“, betonte Bürkl.\nTrotz der durch den Handelsstreit zwischen den USA und China und dem Coronavirus verursachten konjunkturellen Schwächephasen seien aber die Signale vom deutschen Arbeitsmarkt bislang noch ermutigend, was die Konsumstimmung insgesamt stabilisiere, erklärte der Experte. Aufgrund der stabilen Beschäftigungslage könnten die Arbeitnehmer auch in diesem Jahr mit Einkommenszuwächsen rechnen, auch wenn diese nicht mehr so hoch ausfielen wie zuletzt. Auch die Rentner könnten auf eine ansehnliche Erhöhung ihrer Bezüge hoffen.\nGestützt durch die Niedrigzinspolitik der Europäischen Zentralbank behaupte auch die Anschaffungsneigung laut GfK ihr gutes Niveau. Mit 53,6 Punkten liegt dieser Indikator leicht über dem Vergleichswert des Vorjahres. Dagegen verharrt die Sparneigung der Verbraucher weiter im Keller. „Sparen ist und bleibt keine sehr attraktive Alternative zum Konsum“, sagte Bürkl.\nDagegen bleibe der private Konsum ein wichtiger Stabilitätsfaktor der Konjunktur. Die GfK halte ihre Prognose aufrecht, wonach der private Konsum in diesem Jahr um ein Prozent zunehmen wird, so der Experte. Für das vergangene Jahr hatte die Prognose bei einem Zuwachs von 1,5 Prozent gelegen.

China reducirá a la mitad los aranceles sobre productos de EE UU por valor de 75.000 millones de dólares (68.000 millones de euros) a partir del 14 de febrero, anunció el jueves el Ministerio de Finanzas en Pekín. La segunda potencia mundial cumple así las condiciones de la tregua comercial firmada con Trump en enero. Mientras, Washington se prepara para adoptar medidas recíprocas. La decisión llega en un momento de tensión entre los dos países después de que China protestara por la reacción estadounidense a la epidemia del coronavirus.\nEl recorte se aplicará a los aranceles impuestos desde el pasado 1 de septiembre sobre 1.600 productos como la soja, el marisco, las aves de corral o las lámparas de tungsteno para la investigación médica. Tras esta decisión, las tasas del 10% pasarán al 5%, y las que estaban en el 5% se recortarán al 2,5%.\nEl anuncio llega un mes después de que el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, y el viceprimer ministro chino, Liu He, firmaran en Washington la tregua en la guerra comercial que ambos países libran desde hace casi dos años. Entre otros compromisos, China acordaba aumentar sus compras de productos estadounidenses en unos 200.00 millones de dólares en los próximos dos años. Pero tras ese acuerdo el enfrentamiento entre las dos potencias creció. Pekín ha acusado a EE UU de generar pánico en torno a la enfermedad después de que fuera el primer país en prohibir la entrada de viajeros procedentes de China y ser también el primero en evacuar a su personal consular de Wuhan, la ciudad donde comenzó la epidemia. “EE UU aún no ha ofrecido ninguna ayuda sustancial a China.

SINGAPORE - An estimated 20 per cent of the people infected with the Wuhan virus will become very ill, such as with more severe pneumonia, says a Singapore infectious diseases expert. \n That is the current estimate and this may change when more is known about the Wuhan coronavirus, also known as the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), says Dr Shawn Vasoo, the acting clinical director at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). \n There are currently four confirmed cases of the 2019-novel coronavirus in Singapore. The patients had all travelled from China where the virus is spreading fast. \n With concerns growing, The Straits Times asked Dr Vasoo to explain what else is known about the virus that has so far reportedly killed more than 50 people in China. \n A: In some people, the virus infects the lower respiratory tract (lungs) and this results in pneumonia. Not everyone will get pneumonia but in most diagnosed cases so far, pneumonia, of varying severities, has been commonly described. \n A: As there are currently no proven specific anti-viral medications for the 2019-novel coronavirus, one overcomes the infection with our immune system, and recovers thereafter. \n Not all cases of pneumonia are severe, but most patients who have fared poorly are those who have gone on to develop severe pneumonia. \n Severe cases may have more concurrent chronic medical problems such as cardiovascular disease or lung disease. \n Currently, an estimated 20 per cent of the people infected with the 2019-novel coronavirus will become very ill (more severe pneumonia). However, this estimate may change as we learn more about this disease. \n A: The common symptoms include fever, cough, in more severe cases, shortness of breath, especially when there is pneumonia. Occasionally some symptoms may be absent, for example fever. \n A: It is not possible to distinguish clearly between the common cold, influenza and the 2019-novel coronavirus. \n Even influenza, which is more common, can lead to severe disease and pneumonia. It also causes death. \n However, unlike in Wuhan, there is currently no widespread community transmission in Singapore. \n Hence, we would be concerned about a possible 2019-novel coronavirus infection only if one has travelled to China or if one has been in contact with a known case of the infection. \n As for dengue, respiratory symptoms are less common and fever, rash, muscle aches and headaches are more common. \n A: You should seek medical attention if you are not feeling well in general, particularly if symptoms have not improved in two to three days. You should seek immediate medical attention if you have risk factors for the 2019-novel coronavirus as described above, so your doctor can assess you. \n A: If you have symptoms you can see your family doctor or polyclinic who will make the initial assessment. \n If more urgent medical attention is needed, or if it is a medical emergency, you should seek medical attention at the nearest emergency clinic or hospital. \n A: Avoid travelling to affected areas, in particular the Hubei province. If you are travelling to China, you should exercise caution and observe good hand hygiene (hand washing or use of hand sanitisers) and avoid crowded places. \n A photo of a man with a mask on at Plaza Singapura MRT on Jan 26, 2020. ST PHOTO: KELLY HUI \n A: As infection by the 2019-novel coronavirus and other common respiratory viruses are spread by respiratory droplets carrying the virus, surgical masks can prevent inhalation of these droplets. \n You should wear a surgical mask if you are ill to prevent spreading whatever respiratory virus you have to others (this is most commonly influenza and the common cold viruses). This is part of being civic conscious. \n Surgical masks may help prevent infection from respiratory viruses in general, if one is around sick people. \n Those who are more prone to infection, such as the elderly or those with poor immune systems, would want to consider wearing them. \n I would discourage the routine use of N95 masks as mask fitting is typically required for its proper use. \n It is also more stuffy and uncomfortable if used for prolonged periods, and may actually be less effective than a surgical mask if used improperly. \n There is no known transmission of the 2019-novel coronavirus in the community in Singapore at this point, so the routine use of a mask to prevent this particular infection is probably unnecessary. \n However, If you are going to an affected area, you should strongly consider the use of a surgical face mask. \n A: This may vary, as patients have developed symptoms as early as in two days while others may develop symptoms later, for example in 10 to 14 days. The average is estimated to be about one week. \n A: You are most likely infectious when you have symptoms, in particular fever and cough. \n "}, {"content": "Malaysian diplomatic missions to continue operations in china - Wisma Putra. PUTRAJAYA, Feb 7  -- Malaysian diplomatic missions in China will continue their operations to provide consular assistance to countrymen and maintain close collaboration with the authorities of the host country.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Wisma Putra) said the cabinet decision to bring home non-essential staff and family members from the Malaysian diplomatic missions in China was made as part of the government’s state of preparedness in its response to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic.Wisma Putra in a statement said the decision was also made to minimise risks of exposure of Malaysian staff and their family members to the virus.\"This is certainly expected of any responsible government faced with crisis situation resulting from man-made or natural disasters. It was within this context as well that the repatriation of Malaysians from Wuhan was successfully undertaken recently with the full cooperation from the relevant authorities in China.“In the same spirit, the government may also have to advise other Malaysians to return voluntarily should the situation warrant them to do so while being mindful of the determined efforts of the authorities of China to contain and overcome the epidemic,” it said.It said any efforts by the government would be carried out in close consultation with and cooperation from the Chinese government.\"Foreign Minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah and State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi held a telephone call on Feb 1, 2020. This close contact will continue to be maintained given the longstanding and very strong ties and partnership between the two countries,\" it said.Wisma Putra asserted that the repatriation of Malaysians should never be regarded as anything beyond what it was actually intended namely, the government’s intention to ensure the welfare of Malaysians. The ministry said Malaysia had stood and would continue to stand in solidarity with the government and people of China. \"Malaysia has every confidence in their preparedness, resilience, and ability to respond effectively to and overcome the current epidemic.  This sentiment too was shared during the telephone call between the two foreign ministers,\" it said.The ministry underscored that Malaysia still kept its doors open to visitors from China when many other countries did otherwise. The only exception was for those from Wuhan and surrounding areas which have been known as the epicentre of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, Wisma Putra said.-- BERNAMA"}, {"content": "Wie hoch ist die Gefahr einer Ausbreitung?. \nNach dem Bekanntwerden von neuen Infektions-Nachweisen mit dem Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 ist die Hoffnung geschwunden, die Lungenerkrankung aus Deutschland fern zu halten. Was wird getan, um die Ausbreitung einzugrenzen und was ist über das Virus und die Erkrankung bekannt?\nNach Angaben des Robert Koch-Instituts (RKI) müsse mit einem weiteren Import von Fällen nach Deutschland gerechnet werden. Auch weitere Übertragungen von Sars-CoV-2, Infektionsketten und Ausbrüche im Land seien möglich. Lokale Infektionen könnten dabei zunächst unerkannt bleiben, sagte der Vizepräsident des Robert Koch-Instituts (RKI), Lars Schaade, am Mittwoch im RBB. Es sei „durchaus möglich, dass wir nicht alle diese Ausbrüche sofort erkennen“. Man müsse damit rechnen, dass es dadurch zu einer weiteren Ausbreitung komme. Die Gefahr für die Gesundheit der Bevölkerung in Deutschland schätzen die Experten aktuell als gering bis mäßig ein.\nEine Infektionswelle hierzulande könnte unter anderem volle Wartebereiche und Arztpraxen, belegte Intensivbetten und vollkommen überlastete Gesundheitsämter bedeuten, hatte der Berliner Virologe Christian Drosten kürzlich erklärt. Als problematisch sehen Experten, dass derzeit auch die jährliche Grippewelle durch Deutschland rollt - und das Gesundheitssystem bereits stark beansprucht. Aus diesem Grund sei es das Ziel, die Ausbreitung des Coronavirus möglichst hinauszuzögern, wie das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) kürzlich erklärte. „Wir müssen mit angemessenem Aufwand versuchen, die Ausbreitung zu verlangsamen, um einen intensiven Belastungspuls auf das Gesundheitssystem abzumildern“, sagte Drosten. „Die Zahl der Infektionen sollte über eine möglichst lange Zeit ausgedehnt werden.“\nEin Wert, wie viele andere Menschen ein Infizierter im Mittel ansteckt, lässt sich noch immer nicht gesichert angeben. Das Virus verbreitet sich durch Tröpfcheninfektion etwa beim Husten und Sprechen. Erste Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, dass das Virus auch über das Verdauungssystem und zumindest einige Tage über Oberflächen verbreitet werden kann. Ein bisher unterschätztes Risiko sei womöglich, dass in Stuhlproben von Patienten in der Initialphase einer Covid-19-Erkrankung „durchaus relevante Mengen“ von Sars-CoV-2 nachweisbar seien, hatte etwa Clemens Wendtner, Chefarzt der Infektiologie und Tropenmedizin an der München Klinik Schwabing, erklärt.\nDas ist noch immer eine schwierige Frage. Für eine abschließende Beurteilung der Schwere der neuen Atemwegserkrankung liegen gegenwärtig nicht genügend Daten vor, sagt etwas das RKI. Nach einer kürzlich von Chinas Gesundheitsbehörde vorgestellten Analyse sterben im Land 2,3 Prozent der mit Sars-CoV-2 Infizierten. Betroffen sind demnach vor allem alte Menschen und solche mit schweren Vorerkrankungen wie Herzkreislauf-Erkrankungen und Diabetes. Bei Menschen über 80 Jahren liegt die aus den dort vorliegenden Daten errechnete Todesrate bei knapp 15 Prozent, es sterben also in dieser Altersgruppe in China im Mittel etwa 15 von 100 Infizierten. In der Gruppe der 10 bis 39 Jahre alten Menschen sterben 0,2 Prozent der Infizierten, also etwa 2 von 1000 Betroffenen.\nExperten gehen davon aus, dass die Sterblichkeit eigentlich geringer ist als in China errechnet, unter anderem weil in der chinesischen Statistik viele mild verlaufende Infektionen gar nicht erfasst werden. Gesicherte Analysen zur Sterblichkeit aus anderen Ländern gibt es bisher aber nicht.\nDie meisten Menschen haben nur eine leichte Erkältungssymptomatik mit Frösteln und Halsschmerzen oder gar keine Symptome. Hinzukommen können Fieber, Husten und Atemprobleme, wie sie auch bei einer Grippe auftreten. Auch Kopfschmerzen oder Durchfall sind möglich.\nNach Angaben der chinesischen Gesundheitsbehörde komme es bei mehr als 80 Prozent der Infizierten zu milden Infektionsverläufen, knapp 14 Prozent erkranken schwer. Bei knapp fünf Prozent komme es zu lebensbedrohlichen Auswirkungen wie Atemstillstand, septischem Schock oder Multiorganversagen.\nDie Inkubationszeit - der Zeitraum zwischen Infektion und Beginn von Symptomen - beträgt nach derzeitigem Stand meist 2 bis 14 Tage. Das ist der Grund dafür, dass Verdachtsfälle zwei Wochen isoliert werden.\nEine spezielle Therapie für die Erkrankung Covid-19 gibt es nicht. Schwer erkrankte Patienten werden symptomatisch behandelt: mit fiebersenkenden Mitteln, der Therapie etwaiger bakterieller Zusatzinfektionen und mitunter mechanischer Beatmung. In Einzelfällen werden auch antivirale Medikamente getestet.\nNein. Etliche Labors weltweit forschen derzeit an Impfstoffen wie es sie auch für die Grippe gibt. Die Entwicklung einer Schutzimpfung nimmt aber viel Zeit in Anspruch. WHO-Chefwissenschaftlerin Soumya Swaminathan glaubt, dass erste Impfstoff-Tests an Menschen in drei bis vier Monaten beginnen könnten. Ein zertifizierter Impfstoff für weitreichenden Einsatz stehe aber wohl erst in 18 Monaten zur Verfügung.\nDas US-Biotechunternehmen Moderna hatte am Montag berichtet, einen Impfstoff-Kandidaten entwickelt und an das US-National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) geliefert zu haben. Dessen Direktor Anthony Fauci kündigte laut CNN erste klinische Studien für Ende April an. Auch er rechnete demnach damit, dass es ein bis anderthalb Jahre dauere, bevor ein Impfstoff verfügbar ist.\nZum Schutz vor diesem wie auch anderen Viren empfehlen Experten gewöhnliche Hygienemaßnahmen: regelmäßiges Händewaschen, Desinfektionsmittel und Abstand zu Erkrankten. Den Nutzen von normalen Atemmasken - wie derzeit in China und anderen Ländern überall auf den Straßen zu sehen - schätzen Experten als eher gering ein. Helfen kann es, Umarmungen und Händeschütteln einzuschränken und von vielen Menschen berührte Oberflächen wie Türklinken, Haltegriffe und Aufzugknöpfe nicht anzufassen.\nGrundsätzlich sei unklar, wie lange das Virus auf Oberflächen überlebt, sagt die Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO. Studien legten nahe, dass es einige Stunden oder Tage seien - abhängig von Bedingungen wie Oberfläche, Temperatur oder Feuchtigkeit. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass ein Infizierter Waren mit dem Virus verunreinigt, stuft die Behörde als gering ein. Auch das Risiko, dass sich ein Empfänger über ein Paket ansteckt, das auf dem Transport unterschiedlichen Bedingungen und Temperaturen ausgesetzt ist, sei gering.\nImportierte Lebensmittel und Waren wie Spielzeug, Computer oder Kleidung seien als Infektionsquellen ebenfalls unwahrscheinlich, sagt das Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung. Experten betonen, wie wichtig es ist, allgemeine Hygieneregeln zu beachten, also etwa sich regelmäßig die Hände zu waschen.\nWer Kontakt zu einem Infizierten hatte, sollte sich laut RKI zunächst bei seinem Gesundheitsamt melden, unabhängig davon, ob Symptome aufgetreten sind oder nicht. Reisende aus Risikogebieten, die Symptome haben, sollen nach telefonischer Voranmeldung mit Hinweis auf die Reise einen Arzt aufsuchen.\nDas Wesentliche regelt das bundesweit gültige Infektionsschutzgesetz (IfSG). Ein Sprecher des bayerischen Gesundheitsministeriums fasst zusammen: „Wenn es erforderlich ist, können auch wichtige Grundrechte wie Freiheit der Person, Versammlungsfreiheit oder Unverletzlichkeit der Wohnung sowie das Recht auf körperliche Unversehrtheit eingeschränkt werden.“ Behörden dürfen laut dem Bayreuther Staatsrechtler Stephan Rixen Blutentnahmen und Abstriche von Haut und Schleimhäuten verlangen. Auch „Krankheitsverdächtigen“ und „Ansteckungsverdächtigen“ - wie das Gesetz es ausdrückt - könne ein Berufsverbot auferlegt werden. Zum Schutz anderer könnten Menschen auch „in einem geeigneten Krankenhaus oder in sonst geeigneter Weise abgesondert werden“, heißt es im Gesetz.\n"}, {"content": "Não há casamentos nem funerais.

Nenhuma delas é a pior previsão possível, sublinhou hoje Laurence Boone, economista-chefe da Organização para a Cooperação e Desenvolvimento Económico (OCDE), mas variam entre a “melhor” – se o novo coronavírus SARS-CoV-2 (na origem da doença Covid-19)​ ficar essencialmente contido à China e aos focos já conhecidos – ou a mais grave, se se estender de forma mais global.\nNa hipótese de “melhor cenário”, terminada no “início da semana passada”, explicou esta manhã Laurence Boone em conferência de imprensa, o crescimento económico global leva um corte de 0,5% (ou 200 mil milhões de dólares) para 2,4% (face a 2,9% em 2019, que era o mesmo crescimento previsto para organização, em Novembro passado, para 2020). Neste quadro previsional, o crescimento será de 3,3% em 2021 (um pouco acima dos 3,1% esperados em Novembro) disse a economista-chefe da OCDE, estimando a organização que, nesta visão, todo os impactos comecem gradualmente a diluir-se no início do próximo ano.\nUm cenário que corta o crescimento económico mundial em 0,5% implica uma quebra de 4% da procura interna na China e Hong Kong no primeiro trimestre deste ano, a que se juntam mais 2% no segundo trimestre. E, globalmente, uma quebra de 10% nos mercados e nas matérias-primas não alimentares no primeiro semestre de 2020, explica a OCDE.\nNesta leitura, o crescimento da zona euro será de 0,8%, mantendo-se de 1,2% em 2021, baixando da anterior previsão da OCDE, de 1,1%. As previsões da OCDE ficam piores para a França (cresce 0,9% em 2020, face a 1,3% em 2019 e face aos 1,2% previstos em Novembro para este ano) e Itália (estagnação a 0% face a uma crescimento de 0,2% em 2019 e um corte face aos 0,4% que a OCDE previra há quatro meses). Para a Alemanha a previsão é de 0,3% em 2020, face a 0,6% em 2019. Em Novembro de 2019, a OCDE estimava que a economia germânica iria crescer 0,4% este ano. \nNa China, o crescimento previsto para 2020 é de 4,9%, quando em 2019 foi de 6,1%. Aqui, o corte da previsão entre Novembro e hoje é de 0,8 pontos percentuais. \nNo cenário mais pessimista, de efeito “dominó” – sendo que “este não é o pior cenário possível”, frisou esta manhã Laurence Boone, que contornou todas as questões directas sobre a possibilidade de uma potencial recessão a curto prazo, global ou por países – o impacto no PIB mundial será de 1,5%. Isto é, lembrou a economista-chefe da OCDE “quase metade do crescimento económico [global] previsto [pela OCDE] há quatro meses”. Nessa altura, como já referido, a previsão era que em 2020 o crescimento global fosse de 2,9%.\nNeste cenário, além da previsão de redução da procura interna da China, na mesma ordem que o cenário “mais optimista”, junta-se uma extensão a outras regiões: uma diminuição de “mais de 2% na procura na maioria dos países da Ásia-Pacífico” e nas economias mais desenvolvidas no hemisfério Norte durante o segundo trimestre deste ano, com uma quebra de 20% no mercado de capitais e no preço das matérias-primas não alimentares, a par de “um aumento de 50 pontos base no prémio de risco no investimento em todos os países”.\nA OCDE está particularmente preocupada com o “choque de confiança” nos mercados mundiais, reflectido na semana passada nas principais – se não todas – praças da Ásia, Europa e EUA.\nE esse, defendeu esta segunda-feira Laurence Boone, “não é um choque que pode ser enfrentado somente pelos bancos centrais”. Há que, afirmou a economista-chefe da organização: lidar e aumentar a confiança no mercado de capitais. “Esta não é uma crise que possa ser combatida pelos bancos centrais, mas pelas autoridades orçamentais”.\nOs governos “devem agir agora para restringir o avanço do [novo] coronavírus, proteger as populações e os negócios dos seus efeitos e apoiar a procura económica”, aconselha a organização. \nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\n“Há muita coisa que os Governos podem fazer pelas pessoas”, disse Laurence Boone, enquanto apresentada o power point aos jornalistas por videoconferência. E, depois da página com o título “os Governos devem actuar agora”, enumerou as medidas possíveis. Para a população em geral: “aumentar os recursos para o sector da saúde”, “financiar temporariamente para famílias mais vulneráveis”, “expandir modelos temporários de trabalho”.\nNo caso das empresas, as sugestões da OCDE para os governos mundiais lidarem com o novo coronavírus passa por “reduzir ou adiar cobranças fiscais para os sectores mais afectados”; “aumentar a liquidez e disponibilidade de crédito às empresas”, e “reduzir as dívidas do Estado ao sector empresarial”.\nEm termos macroeconómicos, a OCDE deixa também um mini-guião: “aumentar a liquidez à banca”, garantir que a política monetária tem uma resposta adequada “às condições de mercado extremas”; “permitir que estabilizadores automáticos funcionem completamente” e “aumentar o investimento público”.\n"}, {"content": "Chinese public dial in for support as coronavirus takes mental toll. SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Hundreds of 24-hour mental health support telephone hotlines have sprung up in China in recent weeks as millions of people fret about catching the coronavirus - and try to avoid infection by staying at home.\nMedical professionals welcomed the launch of several official services in a country where mental health remains a relatively taboo subject, but cautioned that unofficial talk lines could do more harm than good.\n“There are a lot of hotlines out there staffed by a lot of volunteers but it just doesn’t make sense because there’s not many that can be well-trained,” said Cui Erjing, a Seattle-based volunteer for one of the hotlines, who is originally from China’s Southern Guangdong province.\n“It can be really traumatising to ask for support but not get the right responses.”\nA survey by the Chinese Psychology Society published by state media last week found that of 18,000 people tested for anxiety related to the coronavirus outbreak, 42.6% registered a positive response. Of 5,000 people evaluated for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 21.5% had obvious symptoms.\nThe hashtag #howtodealwithfeelingveryanxiousathome has been trending on social media platform Weibo, with more than 170 million views, as misinformation about the spread of the disease and travel bans feed public worries.\nThe hotlines are part of the government’s “first level response” for dealing with the psychological impact of major health emergencies, a strategy that was first deployed following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, a disaster in which 87,150 people were killed or listed as missing.\nThe National Health Commission said more than 300 hotlines had launched across the country to provide mental health advice related to coronavirus, with support from university psychology departments, counseling services and NGOs.\nThey have been inundated by callers in a country which has just 2.2 psychiatrists available for every 100,000 people, according to WHO data, five times fewer than in the United States.\nA national hotline run by Beijing Normal University was overwhelmed when it went live at the end of January, said Cheng Qi, a Shanghai-based psychologist.\nWhile the number of calls has dropped as other lines opens, the content has become more challenging, Cheng said, noting one caller with chronic depression who had reported suicidal thoughts triggered by the barrage of bad news.\n“It’s not the virus [that caused it], but the virus is stimulating it,” she said.\nXu Wang, a psychotherapist at Tsinghua University, which is working with the official Beijing city hotline, said a major challenge was working out which callers showed real symptoms of the virus and which were instead suffering from anxiety.\n“Callers often have somatic issues, and might say, ‘I can’t eat well, can’t sleep well, and I want to know if it’s a virus infection,’” he said.\nA volunteer group of more than 400 therapists called ‘Yong Xin Kang Yi’, which roughly translates to ‘Use Heart to Fight the Virus’, focuses on helping overworked medical staff in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.\n“They leave messages saying they’re exhausted, that they’re scared,” Cui said. “The doctors don’t know if they’re going to get infected or if their co-workers or going to get infected, and they don’t know how bad it’s spreading.”\nMedical researchers from Peking University included telephone and internet counseling for healthcare staff, patients, and the public among six key strategies for coping with mental stress over the coronavirus outbreak.\n“We believe that including mental health care in the national public health emergency system will empower China and the world during the campaign to contain and eradicate\n2019-nCoV,” the researchers said in a paper published in The Lancet medical journal last week.\nThe government recently issued guidance for the hotlines, saying they should be free, confidential, staffed by volunteers with relevant professional backgrounds and supervised by experienced by experts.\nStill, concerns remain about enforcement.\n“There are many individually initiated helplines and it’s difficult to gain consistent support and supervision,” said Sami Wong, a Beijing-based psychotherapist.\nTsinghua University’s Xu said the very nature of the hotlines added to the challenges, preventing volunteers from gaining much-needed face-to-face experience with people suffering mental health issues.\nWong worried that untrained volunteers could easily put their foot in their mouth. A seemingly innocuous “I can understand how you feel” can cause vulnerable people to clam up, she said: “PTSD training is not something you can learn overnight.”\n(This story corrects transliteration of names in paragraphs 3, 15 and 16)\n"}, {"content": "Bruxelas pede a Facebook e Twitter para combaterem 'fake news' sobre Covid-19.

La frontera entre la información y el alarmismo, o en temas de salud es muy tenue y la aparición de un nuevo coronavirus en China ha puesto otra vez a prueba a los medios de comunicación. El debate entre los lectores de EL PAÍS saltó desde que se publicó la primera noticia hace tres semanas. Desde entonces, casi todos los días hay alguien que critica al diario porque cree que exagera el problema. Otros opinan lo contrario. La polémica no acaba pese a que el propio periódico ha llamado públicamente a la cautela y la mesura.\nEl problema del nuevo virus fue identificado el 16 de diciembre en un hospital de Wuhan (China), pero Pekín no informó a la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) hasta el 31 de diciembre. Diez días después, EL PAÍS publicó en la web la primera información con este titular: Un virus similar al SARS, responsable de la misteriosa neumonía en China.\nEn el texto se indicaba que había 59 personas infectadas, pero ningún fallecimiento. La comparación con el SARS (Síndrome Respiratorio Agudo Grave), que causó 774 muertes en 2002 y 2003, provocó las primeras críticas. Esto comentó un lector en la web: “Venga, a alarmar. 59 afectados por una pulmonía a lo sumo, cero muertos”. Otro le respondió: “Pues es para alarmarse. Si el virus procede de un animal (como se cree), hay un grave problema de salud pública que puede provocar una epidemia”.\nFue el principio de un debate que se disparó cuando el periódico comenzó a publicar el tema en su edición impresa a partir del 17 de enero. El titular en la página 26 de ese día fue: La OMS vigila el avance del virus descubierto en China y detectado en otros dos países. Para entonces, la enfermedad se había cobrado una víctima mortal. Y dos más el día 20, cuando el encabezamiento en la web fue este: El mortal virus de Wuhan se expande por China. El lector Pedro Brañas me dijo por correo que le parecía “inaceptablemente alarmista”. “No me parece un titular responsable para un periódico serio”.\nSiete días después, los infectados eran ya 4.400 en una veintena de países —la mayoría en China, pero la infección ya había llegado a Europa— y la cifra de fallecidos superaba el centenar. Aun así, algunos lectores mantenían posiciones críticas como estas: “Este extraño virus tiene a todos los medios de comunicación poniendo a la población en alerta emocional como si se tratara de la epidemia del fin del mundo”; “alarmismo, que hay que vender”; “esta retransmisión puntual de cada caso solo sirve para transmitir paranoia y alarmismo”.\nVarios lectores se preguntan por qué el periódico narra esta infección y no los graves efectos de la gripe. En la temporada 2018-2019, recuerda C.F., la gripe costó la vida en España a 6.300 personas.\nOriol Güell, especialista en sanidad y firmante de varias informaciones sobre el coronavirus, sostiene que el periódico está cubriendo con amplitud, pero también con prudencia, “una información de gran relevancia científica y médica y, por tanto, de indudable interés para los lectores”. Entre el 20 y el 27, dos noticias sobre el coronavirus estuvieron entre las diez más leídas del periódico y el 30 fue la más seguida cuando la OMS declaró la alerta internacional. “Desconocemos la magnitud que tendrá esta epidemia e informar de su evolución día a día es una obligación ineludible de los medios”, afirma Güell.

SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - The global cost of the coronavirus could be three or four times that of the 2003 Sars outbreak that sapped the world's economy by US$40 billion (S$54.5 billion), according to the economist who calculated that figure. \n The sheer growth in the Chinese economy over the last 17 years means the global health emergency triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, which originated in Wuhan, has far greater potential to gouge global growth, according to Warwick McKibbin, professor of economics at the Australian National University in Canberra. \n \"It's just a mathematical thing,\" McKibbin said in a phone interview. \"Most of the GDP loss that we saw in the Sars model, and in reality, was China slowing down. And so, with China much bigger, you'd expect the billions would be much bigger.\" \n While difficult to pinpoint a precise cost as the crisis is still unfolding, the impact will be experienced mostly through changes in \"human psychology,\" he said. \"Panic is what seems to be the biggest drain on the economy, rather than deaths.\" \n Markets have been whipsawed by panic, Paris-based Amundi Asset Management said in a Jan 29 note. Chief investment officer Pascal Blanque and his deputy Vincent Mortier said the novel coronavirus provided the trigger for a pause in a stock market rally that began in October. \n McKibbin's forecasts are in line with those of other analysts. \n Nomura International expects the blow to China's growth could exceed that seen during the Sars outbreak. Real GDP growth in the first quarter could \"materially drop\" from the 6 per cent pace in the fourth quarter, maybe by even more than the 2 percentage point deceleration seen in the second quarter of 2003 from the first, Nomura economists led by Lu Ting wrote in a report to clients. \n Bloomberg economists Chang Shu, Jamie Rush and Tom Orlik, said: \"Back in 2003, China accounted for just 4 per cent of global GDP. Fast forward to 2020, and its share has increased to 17 per cent. That means the global spillover if China's growth slumps will be larger. \n \"Hong Kong stands out as the most exposed - our simulation shows a hit of 1.7 percentage points (ppt) in the first quarter. South Korea and Vietnam would also suffer, each slowing by 0.4 ppt. Japan would take a 0.2 ppt hit.\" \n More contagious than Sars but less deadly, the insidious nature of the coronavirus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, is such that it often presents as mild cold-like symptoms and can go undetected, which could potentially protract out the crisis for longer than the 2003 epidemic. \n The new virus, which emerged in central China in late 2019, is reported to have infected almost 10,000 people in two months, eclipsing the 8,096 Sars cases reported from November 2002 through 2003, when the contagion spread from China across South-east Asia and to North America and Europe. \n \"If a country had a bad epidemiological outcome, then their shocks were likely be a lot bigger than countries that were able to control it well,\" McKibbin said, referring to his findings from examining the impact of Sars. \n "}, {"content": "Paris Live Monday 20 January 2020.

WASHINGTON - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week as employers continued to hold on to their workers, but the coronavirus pandemic is expected to lead to an increase in layoffs as companies battle supply chain disruptions and sagging demand for some goods and services.  \n Some businesses are already cutting jobs and demand is weakening, at least at the factory level. Other reports on Thursday showed companies announced more than 600 layoffs through March 12 tied to the outbreak, while producer prices fell by the most in five years in February as prices for energy products and services such as hotel accommodation, shipping and air travel dropped.  \n Financial markets are expecting the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates again at its policy meeting next week to counter the coronavirus, which investors fear is the catalyst that will derail the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year.  \n \"It's just a matter of time before the fallout from the coronavirus starts to show up in increased layoff activity,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.  \n Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended March 7, the Labor Department said. Jobless claims are the most timely labor market indicator. They have declined for two straight weeks.  \n Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 218,000 in the latest week.  \n The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,250 to 214,000 last week.  \n Unadjusted claims for Washington state, hardest hit by the virus, which causes a respiratory disease called COVID-19, rose modestly last week.  \n The World Health Organization on Wednesday termed the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. The virus with flu-like symptoms has killed at least 38 people in the United States and sickened more than 1,300. Overall, more than 4,700 people have died from COVID-19 and over 127,000 have been infected.  \n The Fed last week slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%, in its first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis. Financial markets have fully priced in a rate reduction of as much as 75 basis points at the U.S. central bank's March 17-18 policy meeting.  \n Economists are predicting the Fed will reduce its benchmark overnight interest rate to zero by year-end, given low inflation expectations, underscored by a plunge in Treasury yields.  \n The dollar jumped against a basket of currencies after the European Central Bank announced more stimulus to fight the coronavirus but did not lower rates. Stocks on Wall Street continued to drop, with the Dow Jones Industrials index on course for its worst day since 1987 as investors took a dim view of President Donald Trump's decision to suspend travel from Europe. U.S. Treasury prices rose.  \n  \n WEAK PRODUCER PRICES  \n The disease originated in China, the main source of inputs used in factories, as well as goods consumed in the United States. While some Chinese factories have resumed operations after Beijing extended the Lunar New Year holidays in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, they are running below capacity. The coronavirus is hurting demand for transportation, especially air travel, as well as entertainment and recreation, and leisure and hospitality services.  \n Companies in the energy sector have also been affected as crude prices have tumbled, a decline that has been exacerbated by an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The United States is now a net exporter of oil and weak crude prices are likely to hurt capital expenditure and employment in the sector.  \n A separate report on Thursday from global placement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas showed as of the morning of March 12, employers had laid off 633 workers. Most of the job cuts were in the entertainment and leisure industry. Transportation, technology and energy sectors were not spared.  \n The trend could persist, with a third report from the Labor Department showing the producer price index for final demand dropped 0.6% last month, the biggest decline since January 2015, after surging 0.5% in January. In the 12 months through February, the PPI increased 1.3% after gaining 2.1% in January.  \n Economists had forecast the PPI dipping 0.1% in February and rising 1.8% on a year-on-year basis. While the coronavirus-driven bottlenecks in the supply chain could boost prices for inputs, that is likely to be offset by weak oil prices and falling demand for services.  \n In February, wholesale gasoline prices plummeted 6.5% after declining 1.5% in January. Gasoline accounted for nearly one-third of the 0.9% drop in the cost of goods last month. The decline in goods was the most since September 2015 and followed a 0.1% gain in January. Wholesale food prices fell 1.6%.  \n The cost of services dropped 0.3% in February after rebounding 0.7% in January.  \n There were decreases in the cost of airline tickets, water transportation of freight and hotel accommodation, which recorded its biggest decline since April 2009.  \n But the cost of healthcare services rose 0.2% last month after rising 0.6% in January. Portfolio management fees increased 0.3% after accelerating 2.3% in January. They could, however, take a hit from an ongoing sharp sell-off on Wall Street. Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index.  \n \"There are early signs in PPI that the coronavirus will weigh on various consumer prices significantly in coming months,\" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup in New York.

SINGAPORE — It has been just about a month since the first case of Covid-19 landed in Singapore, but Ms Patricia Zhuang has already had her pay cut by half, to just under S$1,000.  \n The 37-year-old sales staff at Vivy Boutique, an apparel store at Novena Square, was converted from a full-time employee to a part-time staff as part of her company’s cost-cutting measures.  \n “Now, I’m only earning my pocket money,” said Ms Zhuang.  \n It’s a similar story for Mr Rex Xu, a manager at Ker’s Hair Salon, over at Jurong East.  \n The decline in the number of customers at the hair salon has led to a drop in his commission, resulting in an overall 50 per cent dip in income, said the 32-year-old.  \n “If this continues, we cannot survive. We need to eat and pay rent,” he said.  \n  Ms Patricia Zhuang, who works at a boutique at Novena Square. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY  \n The novel coronavirus, now officially known as Covid-19, originated from the Chinese city of Wuhan and has now spread to 29 other countries and territories, with Singapore reporting 86 confirmed cases as of Friday (Feb 21).  \n Not only has the virus infected close to 75,000 individuals globally and caused more than 2,000 deaths, mainly in China, it also left a trail of economic casualties.  \n As the authorities in Singapore try to curb the spread of the virus through various measures, such as a travel ban on non-residents who have been to China recently, businesses in the retail and food and beverage (F&B) sectors have borne the brunt of the sharp drop in tourist arrivals and weak consumer spending among Singaporeans.  \n The virus-related blow comes on the back of an already challenging retail environment, which has been buffeted by continuing US-China trade tensions and e-commerce competition.  \n The plight of Ms Zhuang and Mr Xu was not uncommon among retail and F&B employees as TODAY went around eight different locations across the island this past week to find out how businesses in these sectors were coping with the economic fallout of the Covid-19 outbreak.  \n On Monday, the Trade and Industry Ministry downgraded its 2020 full-year growth forecast for Singapore to between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent — with a possible recession — from an initial projection of between 0.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent.  \n Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had earlier said that the Covid-19 situation already had a greater impact on the economy compared to when Singapore went through an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) back in 2003, and would likely last longer.  \n A ‘PITIFUL’ SIGHT  \n With travel restrictions imposed on non-residents who have been to China in the last 14 days, it is unsurprising that tourist spots have been hit the hardest.  \n At Chinatown, staff and business owners of several establishments told TODAY that sales had gone down by 80 per cent.  \n “Business has dropped so much that it’s very quiet here, nobody at all during the night time… Everybody here is very worried, it’s very pitiful,” said Ms Kathy Fan, co-owner of Vietnamese restaurant Co Ba Quan, which is located along Chinatown’s Food Street.  \n When TODAY visited the street on a weekday afternoon, it was possible to see one end of the road from the other, lined with rows of empty tables. Tourists were few and far between, with some restaurants serving only one table of customers, or none at all.  \n One elderly worker could be seen dozing off at an empty table. \n Earlier this week, TODAY reported that some Chinese workers, businesses in Singapore — including those in Chinatown — are being shunned, amid discrimination faced by some Chinese nationals here. The discrimination stems from anxiety over Covid-19, which originated in the city of Wuhan in China.    \n  Empty tables at Chinatown, where the outbreak of the coronavirus has hit businesses hard. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n But the retail slump goes beyond that — consumers are also avoiding retailers and F&B outlets elsewhere.  \n At Jewel Changi, sales staff said that business had gone down by as much as 70 per cent. Queues at fast-food outlets Shake Shack and A&W were also visibly shorter.    \n And it is not just retail outlets at tourist spots that have been affected. Businesses in the heartlands from Simei to Jurong East also reported a slump in sales.   \n Mr Kelvin Wai, owner of Evergreen Handphone Shop at Simei, said the travel restrictions had also affected his business as 20 per cent of his customers were Chinese tourists who bought mobile phone SIM cards. He has stopped ordering new stock with business down by 40 per cent.  \n At The Digital Gadgets, a mobile phone accessory outlet at Westgate mall in Jurong East, its manager, Ms Serena Nguyen, said that her company was trying to push for more online sales via e-commerce websites as business had dropped by 50 per cent at the shop.  \n Reports of confirmed Covid-19 cases at Marina Bay Financial Centre, as well as companies’ directive for staff to work from home, have also turned the Marina Bay Link Mall into a “ghost town”, said Ms Lyn Lee, founder of Awfully Chocolate.  \n Sales of her two stores at the Marina Bay area have been particularly affected, she said.  \n When TODAY visited Suntec City around noon on Thursday, there was a decent lunchtime crowd at the restaurants surrounding its iconic Fountain of Wealth. But those located further away were more than half empty.  \n Mr Oscar Apiado, the outlet manager of apparel store The Shirt Bar, said that the mall corridors were “almost empty” after 3pm when the lunchtime crowd dwindled.  \n At Japanese buffet restaurant Kuishin Bo, staff could be seen standing around, tending to only a handful of customers during the lunch hour. \n Its restaurant manager, Ms Chao Jun, said that the place would typically be three-quarters full during lunchtime, but it was not even a quarter-full when TODAY was there.  \n SHORTER OPENING HOURS, STAFF ASKED TO TAKE NO-PAY LEAVE  \n With sales dropping by 80 per cent, Ms Chao said staff had been asked to clear leave as there was no longer the need to have the usual manpower strength of five servers on a weekday.  \n “Now I only plan for two people to work. Even two people also got nothing to do… only standing there waiting for customers,” she said. \n Even restaurants which open only for dinner are facing the same problem. Last Saturday, Mr Marjun de Claro, manager at the House of Peranakan at Outram Park, said that the restaurant did not have a single customer for the whole night.  \n The “zero sales” phenomenon is also happening at retail outlets. Ms Zhuang said that there were several days where the store did not manage one single transaction. There was one particular day where it made a total of S$15 in sales.   \n When TODAY visited apparel store Ns’ Boutique at Square 2 at 2pm on Wednesday, its director Ms Chrislyn Ng said the store had not managed a single sale since it opened at 10.30am.   \n With business down by 30 per cent, Mr Freddy Ng, operations manager of Wang Tian Kitchen at Outram Park, said that his restaurant is now closed on Saturdays. Operating hours on weekdays have also shortened by about two hours.  \n Across the island, several business owners said they have started similar cost-cutting measures, such as reducing the number of part-time staff, or shortening the working hours of their full-time staff, inevitably affecting the income of these workers.  \n Several workers also voiced fears about losing their jobs if their companies continue to be battered over the next few months.  \n Ms Candy Chen, 47, a sales staff at Just Mobile, a mobile phone accessory store at Nex mall in Serangoon, said her commission had fallen by 30 per cent along with the drop in sales.  \n All three employees of Mr Joe Chen, a director of two apparel stores at Novena Square, have been asked to take turns to go on no-pay leave. As a result, they end up working only three to four days a week.   \n He has applied for them to go for skills upgrading courses on the days that they are not working.  \n  Like other malls across the island, businesses at Novena Square have been affected. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY  \n CONSUMERS STAYING AT HOME  \n With companies activating remote-working arrangements, and more individuals choosing to stay home because of the Covid-19 outbreak, it is not surprising that malls are seeing lower footfall, thus affecting the businesses of retailers and F&B outlets.  \n For Ms Michelle Chin, 49, it is not just the malls she is avoiding. She has also stopped going to her church in Bukit Batok.   \n “When (the virus crisis) first broke out, I said I didn’t want to go church. My kids say, ‘Ma, don’t be paranoid’. But it’s my personal choice… It’s just a precaution,” said the retiree, who had stopped attending church service for the past three Sundays.  \n Some churches and other religious institutions have cancelled or scaled back their regular religious services and holding them online instead, after two Covid-19 clusters were identified at churches. \n Before the outbreak, Ms Chin used to head to Novena Square at least once a day to buy her groceries, and patronised some of the shops in the mall now and then.  \n That has all but stopped with the exception of a weekly grocery run.  \n Even then, it is a real quick run. “The minute I get into the mall, I get to the escalator, buy whatever I need and run back,” said Ms Chin.  \n While work-from-home arrangements naturally mean that F&B establishments in office areas would see a smaller lunch-time crowd, it does not automatically translate to increased sales at outlets in residential estates.  \n To reduce the risk of exposure to the virus, Ms Doreen Yeow started working from home whenever possible even before her workplace made it official.  \n Her lunch now consists of home-cooked food, as the 38-year-old engineer has stopped going to crowded places, such as malls.  \n “I don’t step out of the house at all,” she said. She only left home twice in the past week, once to visit her parents and another time to attend a class.  \n Mr Sean Wei Leong, a 32-year-old risk manager, who also started working from home last week, said he generally avoids crowded areas, such as Orchard Road, although he does head to the suburban malls in Tampines where he lives.  \n SOME LANDLORDS EXTEND A HELPING HAND  \n Amid mounting calls for help from the retail and F&B sectors due to the Covid-19 outbreak, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Tuesday unveiled two special packages totalling S$5.6 billion to help firms and workers, as well as households during his Budget speech. \n The packages dwarf the S$230 million package introduced during the Sars crisis in 2003, and significantly exceeded analysts’ expectations of at least a S$500 million package.  \n Part of the S$5.6 billion package is a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package (SSP) meant for businesses and workers affected by the Covid-19 outbreak.  \n The SSP includes:  \n  A S$1.3 billion Jobs Support Scheme where the Government will pay for 8 per cent of the wages of local employees, up to a monthly cap of S$3,600, for three months. \n  Flexible rental payments for tenants and lessees under the JTC Corporation, Housing and Development Board (HDB), Singapore Land Authority, Singapore Tourism Board and Sentosa Development Corporation. \n A waiver of one full-month of rent for tenants at National Environment Agency-managed hawker centres and markets. \n A half-month rent waiver for tenants under government agencies, such as HDB.  \n A 15 per cent property tax rebate for Changi Airport and commercial properties. \n “I strongly urge landlords to pass this on to their tenants by reducing rentals,” Mr Heng had said. \n Several property developers, such as CapitaLand, GuocoLand, AsiaMalls and Frasers Property, have said that they will pass on the full savings of the tax rebates to their tenants, in response to TODAY’s queries.  \n Marketing campaigns and free parking for visitors, among other initiatives, have also been introduced by some developers to help their struggling tenants.   \n At Suntec City, for example, tenants facing liquidity issues can tap a recently set up S$5 million fund which provides “short term, low-cost borrowing and quick access to funds for working capital”, said Mr Anthony Yip, deputy chairman of APM Property Management, Suntec City's property manager. \n BUSINESSES SAY THEY NEED MORE HELP   \n On the Budget measures, several businesses told TODAY that they would have preferred more direct help on rental rebates — such as how Jewel Changi is offering a 50 per cent rebate on rent for its F&B tenants for the months of February and March — instead of leaving it to the landlords’ discretion whether to pass on savings from tax rebates to them.  \n “Savings from the tax rebates are nothing to me… We are talking about occupancy costs (being) as high as 70 to 80 per cent (out of tenants’ total costs) now,” said Mr R Dhinakaran, president of the Singapore Retailers Association (SRA).   \n If developers do not provide a direct rebate on rent, a potential consequence would be the closures of several retailers, causing the malls to be empty, he noted.  \n “What can (the developers) do? They can’t sue everybody who can’t pay rent… (Retailers) will just pull down the shutters and go away… That’s a situation, I hope, will not happen,” Mr Dhinakaran said. \n Instead, a “fair approach” during these challenging times would be to pay the landlord a certain percentage of the tenants’ sales as rent, he suggested.  \n  Some establishments at Jewel Changi Airport have seen a 70 per cent fall in business amid the Covid-19 crisis.​ Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n Mr Vincent Tan, president of the Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS), echoed Mr Dhinakaran’s sentiments, adding that passing on savings from a tax rebate is “way below” what the association is asking for.  \n “In fact, the 15 per cent rebate (announced during Budget) comes from the Government. The developers (are not going to) sacrifice a single cent,” Mr Tan said.   \n Last week, RAS told the media that it had sent letters to 24 landlords, requesting that they offer rental rebates of up to 50 per cent for February, March and April.  \n Awfully Chocolate’s Ms Lee said there was “little” offered in the Budget that would help retailers directly and materially. Recalling how property tax rebates were also part of the Sars relief package back in 2003, she said that landlords then were reluctant to pass on the savings to their tenants. \n “It felt as if a great amount of cajoling had to be done before help was given… Is the same thing going to happen? I can only assume so… So if the Government’s intention is that these tax rebates are passed down to the tenants, then I think they should be given with a set of parameters and directives. Not left to goodwill and best endeavours,” she added. \n Passing on the savings of a tax rebate may also not be as timely as compared to a direct rebate, said Wang Tian Kitchen's Mr Ng.   \n “If for now, I keep paying the same rent, so at the end of the year, the landlord say, ‘I rebate you 15 per cent’. What’s the point? It won’t help already. The thing is already over by then,” he said. \n Some businesses said they were disappointed that unlike the 2003 Sars relief package,  the foreign worker levies were not reduced this time.  \n While Ms Chris Lim, a business partner at children edutainment provider Diggersite, said she knows that the Government’s intention is to encourage companies to hire more locals, her hands, unfortunately, are tied.   \n “Our situation is different. The jobs we have, the locals will not take... (The Government) thinks we should hire locals, but it’s actually not our call,” said Ms Lim, whose business includes a cafe at Suntec City.  \n As her company provides edutainment at company events and conducts field trips for children, she has had to temporarily suspend these weekday services, as the Government has discouraged large-scale public gatherings with the raising of the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) risk assessment level from Yellow to Orange.  \n As for Mr Wai, who is renting a space from HDB for his mobile phone accessories shop in Simei, he lamented that the half-month waiver for rental is “very little” and not of much help.  \n However, he said he was looking forward to the possibility of setting up flexible arrangements to pay rent, such as through an instalment plan.  \n A STRUGGLE TO HANG ON  \n With no end in sight to the Covid-19 outbreak yet, and consumers continuing to shun the malls and eateries, businesses are worried about the prospect of closures should the situation drag on longer than expected.  \n Mr Heng has repeatedly assured businesses and households that the Government is watching the situation closely, and it will not hesitate to do more if needed.  \n Mr Chen, the apparel store director, said that he has an emergency fund that would be able to tide him through this crisis for the next six months, at most.  \n “If worst comes to worst, if after six months and we’re still making losses, then we may have to close one of our stores. Instead of two, we would just run one,” he added.  \n Other businesses gave a shorter time frame.  \n For example, Diggersite’s Ms Lim said she may have to take more drastic measures, such as retrenching full-time staff, if things do not improve in three months.  \n Mr Shah Iskandar, owner of South Asian eatery Az Zumar at Outram Park, said he would assess the situation in a month’s time.   \n “If the problem goes beyond end of March, finances will be very tight for us,” he said. He might have to cut short his eatery’s operating hours, which is currently open for 24 hours daily to just 12.  \n That would also mean cutting the number of staff required to sustain the operations, he added.  \n Mr Dhinakaran said most retailers would probably be able to hold the fort for only the next two to three months, if things do not get better or if the landlords do not provide substantial rebates in rent.   \n “Suppliers will also chase for money. You have stock in the shop but not sold, doesn’t mean they won’t chase… You have to pay this, pay that, but no sales, how do you pay? Then everybody will put up their hands and say, ‘Sorry cannot pay’. That’s what will happen,” he said.  \n RAS’ Mr Tan said most F&B outlets would be able to sustain business under current conditions for the next three to six months.  \n Professor Lawrence Loh, from the National University of Singapore Business School, called on major developers — the ones with the “deep pockets”— to “demonstrate their social responsibility” and help retailers and F&B outlets struggling to cope with the crisis.  \n He pointed out that the economy this time would not undergo a V-shaped recovery, unlike what happened after Singapore eradicated Sars in July 2003.   \n “It would be more like a flat U-shaped recovery… For this Covid-19 outbreak, it’s expected to be longer. It will simmer on, in dribs and drabs... There will be a persistent effect on retail. And even after the outbreak is officially declared to be over, business will not just recover overnight,” he said.  \n In the meantime, for service staff like Ms Zhuang and Mr Xu, they would need to tighten their belts and watch their spending — setting off a spiral of reduced consumption which would further hit retailers and eateries.  \n “Right now, having a job is not bad already,” said Mr Xu. \n CORRECTION: An earlier version of the article stated that Ns’ Boutique was located at Novena Square.

BEIJING - China’s health commission said on Monday (Jan 20)  that medical workers have been infected by the deadly coronavirus first discovered in the central city of Wuhan, confirming it can be transmitted between people. \n “The current situation is that it is no longer animal to human transmission, but human to human,” said Chinese pulmonologist Zhong Nanshan, who discovered the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) coronavirus in 2003 and now heads an expert panel under the health commission. \n He cited a case in Guangdong, where the patient had not been to Wuhan but caught the virus from a family member. Dr Zhong also said 14 medical personnel helping with coronavirus patients have been infected by one carrier. \n \"The key to controlling the spread of the disease now is to prevent a super-spreader from emerging,” Dr Zhong, director of the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, said. \n Another member of the expert panel, virologist Gao Fu, said: “The virus is changing. The virus is adapting to the environment and adapting to humans.” \n The expert panel warned that the number of infections will increase with the Chinese New Year mass migration. \n The World Health Organisation said on Monday that a key emergency committee would meet this week to discuss the spread of the virus across China after it reached three other Asian countries. \n The Wuhan virus that has killed three people so far has spread to China's financial hub Shanghai with more cases reported elsewhere in the country. \n According to state broadcaster CCTV, new confirmed cases have been found in Beijing and Guangdong, bringing the tally to five and 14 respectively in these two cities as of 6pm local time on Monday, while the figure remains at 198 in Wuhan - unchanged since the last official update earlier at 1pm local time. \n Shanghai, in a separate press release posted on the website of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission on Monday, also reported its first confirmed case. This brings the total number of confirmed cases in China to 218. \n The case in Shanghai, a city with a population of 24.2 million, is a 56-year-old woman from Wuhan in central China's Hubei province. She arrived in Shanghai from Wuhan on Jan 12 and was hospitalised and isolated on Jan 15 after showing symptoms of fever and fatigue. She was confirmed to have been infected by the virus called 2019-nCoV on Monday after testing positive. \n The patient is no longer feverish and her vital signs are stable, said the Shanghai press release. \n CCTV also reported two suspected cases in Sichuan, one in Yunnan, two in Shanghai, one in Guangxi and one in Shandong. \n A man wears a mask near the Tiananmen Gate Tower in Beijing, on Jan 20, 2020.

LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December has infected tens of thousands of people in China and beyond and triggered alarm around the world. (here) Here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:\n* Like other coronaviruses, the new virus - which causes a disease now called COVID-19 - is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n* Scientists in China who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought.\n* COVID-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.\n* A World Health Organization-led team of investigating scientists in China has said that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then.\n* They also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan.\n* Infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people.\n* The WHO said on Monday that the COVID-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was “too early” to speak of a pandemic.\n* Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n* Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with “crown”-like spikes.\n* Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.\n* Genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a “recombinant” virus strain.\n"}, {"content": "covid-19 outbreak expected to last longer than sars and cause greater economic impact, life has to go on: pm lee. SINGAPORE — While it took four months before the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) was fully eradicated from Singapore back in 2003, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to last longer, with a greater impact already hitting the economy. \n However, Mr Lee stressed that “life has to go on” and Singaporeans have to continue making a living. \n Speaking to reporters on Friday (Feb 14) after meeting various frontline staff members at Changi Airport, Mr Lee said: “Sars took us from March when we had our first cases, until July before we were declared clear and that was, I think very fast. I expect it not to be so fast this time.” \n As China’s economy is bigger and more interlinked with Singapore and the region compared to the situation in 2003 then, Mr Lee said that the economic impact of the outbreak would be significant as it is a “very intense outbreak”.  \n He added that a recession was “possible” and the economic impact on Singapore so far is already believed to be much more than Sars.  \n Speaking to several frontline staff at Changi Airport, including airline crew and sales personnel at the retail stores, he said that the airport had been “substantially impacted”. \n “The flights are down by a third, the shops here are hard hit, and at the same time the crews have to keep the airport running and stay at their posts and keep Singapore open for business”, he said. \n He said that new developments were happening every day and the Government is making a judgement on what is the right thing to do at each point.  \n “So we have to calibrate and judge as we go on each step, what is the most prudent thing to do. Err on the side of caution, but make a sensible judgment. And that’s what we're trying,” he said.  \n  \n The novel coronavirus, now officially known as Covid-19, originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and has spread to 28 countries and territories, including Singapore, which confirmed 58 cases as of Thursday — the highest number outside of China. \n However, he added that the higher number of reported cases here is due to Singapore’s size and thorough checks by the health authorities. \n While it is understandable for other countries to issue travel advisories against Singapore, he said that they should not make “knee-jerk” decisions to escalate their warnings to an outright ban just based on the headline numbers. \n It is however a different story for bigger countries, which are made up of 10,000 islands, a large land mass or many rural areas, noted Mr Lee. \n “It is not so easy to track what's happening in that country so the reported cases and the developments, there may be some lag before things become known,” he said. \n These circumstances have to be made known to other countries so that they would have the available facts before deciding whether to issue a travel advisory or even a ban on Singapore. \n “To go beyond (a travel advisory), while we will make our case very clearly to the other countries that ‘This is a real situation, please make a sound scientific and medical judgment. Don't just act on a knee jerk, based on somebody's headline,’” said Mr Lee. \n When asked about more clusters emerging, PM Lee said that this does not yet constitute widespread community transmission as most of these cases are still traceable to a particular source. \n “So we will have to watch the trend,  how the trend goes, whether the numbers go up and also whether the cases are traceable and we can continue to do contact tracing and then squeeze out the clusters one by one,” he said. \n During Mr Lee’s visit at Changi Airport, he also met taxi drivers who were willing to ferry healthcare workers and gave them a care package consisting of hand sanitisers and disinfectant wipes.  \n Separately on Friday, he also penned a Valentine’s Day note to all healthcare workers on the frontline.  \n Posting a photo of his handwritten card on Facebook, he thanked them for looking after patients “day after day”. \n \"Your loving care and commitment makes all the difference. We all stand with you and give you our full support,\" he wrote.  \n   \n "}, {"content": "Coronavirus: India's response so far holds lessons for other countries | OPINION. Given the scale of the challenge and the danger to human lives the WHO has described the pandemic as the \"defining global health crisis of our time\" -- the efforts of Indian government under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been applauded widely. Henk Bekedam, the WHO Representative to India, was quoted as saying that the \"commitment of the Indian government from the top level has been enormous, and very impressive\".\nAt the very first level -- unlike China, which long remained in denial mode -- the Indian government was quick enough to activate its health management system and issue necessary travel advisories. Many state governments followed suit, leading to the early detection and isolation of infected patients.\nMoreover, the state machinery -- led by the Ministry of Health and other related agencies -- were prompt enough to issue 'valid precautionary guidelines' to keep the public well-informed and prepared.\nThe monitoring of the coronavirus outbreak at the PMO level has backed this process. Well-coordinated action plans include careful airport checking, active health laboratories and the quick establishment of quarantine facilities across the country. The strategy of the government has been to stick to the prevention is better than cure’ model.\nMore importantly, the Indian government has also been applauded globally for safely flying back many of its citizens -- especially workers and students stuck abroad in the mainland China and other coronavirus-affected countries, speaking volumes about the government’s concern and efforts for its citizens.\nIn addition, Indian efforts have remained completely aligned to guidelines from the WHO, which has been monitoring the crisis since it began and advocating the aggressive testing, tracking and isolation of as many Covid-19 (the disease caused by the novel coronavirus) cases as possible.\nTo sum it up, managing a new virus outbreak is never a easy task for any state, but the way the Indian emergency response system has been activated holds lessons for the other countries in the future.\nAbhishek Pratap Singh has a PhD in China Studies from JNU and teaches at the Deshbandhu College, University of Delhi.

Hubei's Health Commission also reported 14,840 new COVID-19 positive cases on the same day.Apart from one death in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines that occurred last week, Japan announced one death yesterday. The Japan Times quoted Health Minister Katsunobu Kato as saying that the patient who died was a woman in her 80s who hailed from Kanagawa region in the southwest of Tokyo.Japan has 33 cases of domestic infection; however, some 218 people on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which has been docked at the port in Yokohama since early February, have also been tested positive for COVID-19.Besides China and Japan, others in the top 10 countries with the highest number of infections are Singapore 58 cases, Thailand 33, South Korea 28, Malaysia 19, Germany 16, Vietnam 16, Australia 15, United States 15 and France 11. Yesterday, AFP reported that several villages in Vietnam with about 10,000 people situated close to the nation's capital were placed under quarantine yesterday after six cases of COVID-19 were discovered there.On Feb 11, media reports from Wuhan stated that new research based on data gathered from more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients in China found that the incubation period for the virus was as long as 24 days rather than the previously believed 14 days.The study, carried out by about 36 researchers from Chinese hospitals and medical schools, found that less than half of the patients showed fever symptoms when they first saw a doctor.Head of the research team Dr Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese epidemiologist who discovered the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, was quoted as saying that much is still unknown about COVID-19.Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and breathing difficulty. In more severe cases, the infection can lead to lung inflammation, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. COVID-19 BACKGROUNDAccording to the WHO website, its China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia that were detected in Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019. On Jan 7, the Chinese authorities confirmed that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted from human to human.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV).A study of the virus' genetic sequence suggested similarities to that seen in snakes and bats.China health officials identified the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan as the source of the transmission of the coronavirus.Besides Malaysia, COVID-19 has spread to Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Vietnam, Germany, United States, France, Macau, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Russia, Spain, Finland, Cambodia, Sweden, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Belgium.On Jan 30, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak as a global emergency.

Thailand and Japan have confirmed new cases of the virus earlier this week, stoking worries globally as many of the 1.4 billion Chinese people will travel abroad during the Lunar New Year holidays that begin next week.\nAuthorities around the world including in the United States, Thailand and South Korea have stepped up monitoring of travelers from Wuhan as part of their efforts to prevent the disease from spreading.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned that a wider outbreak is possible, though it has advised against any travel restrictions for China.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission (WMHC) said on Saturday the four new individuals diagnosed with the new virus are in stable condition, adding it has confirmed 45 cases in the city as of Thursday. A day earlier, the commission confirmed the death of a second patient.\nNearly 50 people are now known to have been infected globally, but all of them either live in Wuhan or have traveled to the city.\nA report published by the London Imperial College’s MRC Center for Global Infectious Disease Analysis said there are likely “substantially more cases” of the new coronavirus than currently announced by Wuhan authorities: its base scenario estimate is that there would be 1,723 cases showing onset of related symptoms by Jan. 12.\nThe WMHC referred Reuters queries about the report to the National Health Commission (NHC) and the Hubei provincial government, but the NHC and the Hubei government did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Wuhan is the capital of Hubei province.\nU.S. authorities have said they would start screening at three airports to detect travelers arriving via direct or connecting flights from Wuhan who may have symptoms of the new virus.\nIn Asia, authorities in Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand have stepped up monitoring of passengers from Wuhan at airports. Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines say they have strengthened screening at all points of entry in response to the outbreak, as well.\nBut Alexandra Phelan, global health legal expert at Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, said such screening may be insufficient in preventing the virus from spreading as its symptoms, which include fever, cough and difficulty in breathing, are “quite general”.\n“There are likely to be many individuals with matching symptoms due to an illness that is not 2019-nCoV,” Phelan said, referring to the new virus.\n"}, {"content": "u.s. cdc reports 68,440 coronavirus cases, 994 deaths.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The existence of a substantial but unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that people could still be spreading COVID-19 without knowing they are sick.\nAs the virus continues to wreak havoc across the world, China is close to declaring victory and is already easing travel restrictions. The border of Hubei province, epicenter of the virus, opened on Wednesday after a two-month shutdown.\nBut there are concerns that the end of the lockdown will release thousands of infectious people back into circulation.\nAsymptomatic cases present a huge challenge in the control of infectious disease, making it harder to detect and stop transmission.\nIn China, the number of known asymptomatic cases is classified, and it is not included in the official data, though the South China Morning Post, citing unpublished official documents, recently said it was more than 40,000.\nChina had reported 81,218 coronavirus cases, and 3,281 deaths by the end of Tuesday.\nAsymptomatic cases are currently found through “contact tracing”. China identifies people exposed to someone with a confirmed diagnosis, and if they test positive, they are quarantined whether or not they manifest symptoms.\n“Asymptomatic patients have all been discovered during our contact tracing,” said Wu Zunyou of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention at a briefing on Tuesday. “So will they be able to create transmission? They won’t.”\nStill, the failure to include them in the official data has raised concerns about Beijing’s commitment to transparency, and some experts say it could also create a misleading picture about how the epidemic spreads and whether or not it is under control.\nDespite recording zero new infections from March 18 to March 22, the COVID-19 hotspot city of Wuhan disclosed on March 20 that one newly diagnosed case was not included in the official data because the patient, a 62-year old man surnamed Zhang had shown no symptoms.\nCiting hospital sources, the news magazine Caixin also reported that a new case in Wuhan on Tuesday was a doctor who had been infected by an asymptomatic patient.\nChina says asymptomatic patients will be added to the list of confirmed patients if they show symptoms at a later stage.     But it remains unclear how many asymptomatic cases remain undiagnosed and therefore unquarantined.\nSome experts warn that undetected, asymptomatic patients could create fresh transmission routes once lockdowns are eased.\n“It is especially concerning given that many countries have yet to implement sufficient levels of widespread community testing,” said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a public health specialist at the University of Sydney.\nIt is also unclear how much they might infect others.\n“We know that that is possible, but we do not believe that that’s a major driver of transmission,” said Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organization at a briefing early in March.\nNew studies show that asymptomatic carriers could pose risks. One analysis of the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak showed that 33 of the 104 infected passengers remained asymptomatic even after an average of 10 days of observation at the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Japan.\nWhile many appeared healthy throughout, a few other initially asymptomatic passengers quickly became seriously ill.\nAnother study published on March 23, looking at cases in the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing, said 18% of patients were asymptomatic. Another even found that people are more likely to transmit the disease when symptoms are at their mildest.\nThe Yale School of Public Health said the existence of presymptomatic (asymptomatic) patients meant that screening procedures at airports and other points of entry were insufficient to prevent the coronavirus passing from China to other countries.\n“The real picture will only come to light when we have a serological test to find out who has been infected,” said Ian Henderson, Director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at Queensland University.\n"}, {"content": "GP da China adiado devido ao surto do novo coronavírus.

Ganz und gar nicht. Die Proteste in Hongkong, deren Bilder brennender Barrikaden und prügelnder Polizisten im vergangenen halben Jahr um die Welt gingen, sind leiser geworden – und seltener. Fort sind sie nicht, sie haben sich nur verlagert. Kelvin nennt seinen echten Namen lieber nicht. Es ist Ende Januar, der letzte Abend des chinesischen Neujahrsfestes, der 22-Jährige ist unterwegs zu Verwandten.\nDie Telefonverbindung ist kratzig, „Ich bin in der U-Bahn“, sagt Kelvin dumpf wie durch Watte. Er trägt wieder eine Maske. Aber keine schwere, gegen Tränengasnebel, sondern eine leichte – gegen das Coronavirus, das seinen Weg nach Hongkong gefunden hat. Einen Tag zuvor hat die Regierungschefin Carrie Lam den Ausnahmezustand ausgerufen. Das örtliche Disneyland schließt, Fotos zeigen öffentliche Plätze leer und verlassen, Demonstrationen wird es vorerst keine geben. Allerdings drohen Unternehmen, Ärzte und Krankenschwestern für Montag mit Streik – sollte die Regierung nicht zustimmen, Hongkong für Besucher aus Festland-China komplett abzuriegeln.\nEnde der Neujahrsferien\nEigentlich hätten die Schüler der Stadt nach dem Ende der Neujahrsferien am Montag wieder in den Unterricht zurückkehren sollen. Am Freitag verkündete Lam allerdings, dass die Schulen wegen der Ansteckungsgefahr bis März geschlossen bleiben. „Die Stadt ist in Panik“, sagt Kelvin. Nichts ist mehr normal. Aber darum geht es ihm jetzt nicht.\n2020 werde alles anders werden, hatte der Hongkonger Verwaltungschef Matthew Cheung noch im Dezember versprochen. Kelvin lacht bitter. Er hat schon lange kein Vertrauen mehr in die Politik. Einmal in der Woche etwa sei er zuletzt demonstrieren gegangen, sagt Kelvin. Und natürlich gebe es auch immer wieder brutale Szenen, nach wie vor gehe die Polizei gewalttätig vor. Aber der wahre Protest spiele sich nicht mehr auf der Straße ab, sondern auf wirtschaftlicher Ebene. In den vergangenen Monaten hat sich etwas entwickelt, das die Demonstranten „yellow economy“ nennen, gelbe Wirtschaft.\nIn einer ständig wachsenden Art Online-Registratur werden Geschäfte, Restaurants, sogar Fitness-Studios als entweder gelb oder blau bezeichnet. Gelb bedeutet: demokratiefreundlich. Blau: pekingfreundlich. „Ich bin rigoros“, sagt Kelvin, „ich gebe keinen Penny bei jenen aus, die den Protesten kaltblütig gegenüberstehen.“ Es funktioniere ganz gut, sagt er, die blauen Geschäfte bekämen erste Probleme. Es ist der Kollateralschaden einer Revolution, dass auch einfache Angestellte getroffen sein können – deren Verträge gekündigt werden. Das sei geschehen, heißt es.\nWichtiger Finanz- und Handelsplatz\nIm Detail lässt sich das nicht nachprüfen. Doch es scheint klar zu sein, dass die Wirtschaft Hongkongs – immerhin ein für China wichtiger Finanz- und Handelsplatz – unter den Protesten gelitten hat. Regierungschefin Carrie Lam warnt beständig vor schlechten Zahlen. Doch falls dies den Demonstranten Angst machen sollte, funktioniert es nicht. Wenn wirtschaftlicher Druck auf die Pekinger Regierung nicht wirkt, was denn dann? Kelvin sagt: „Wie du dein Geld ausgibst, ist wie eine Stimmabgabe bei einer Wahl.“ Zugleich ist es eine niedrigschwellige Form des Protests. Jeder kann mitmachen, ohne sich in Gefahr zu bringen. Längst ist Konsum politisch geworden. Es passt zu dieser Protestbewegung, dass sich aus den Untiefen ihrer kreativen Masse die nächste dynamische Strategie entwickelte.\n„Sei Wasser, mein Freund“– ein halbes Jahr lang war dieses Zitat von Bruce Lee das Motto der Demonstrierenden in Hongkong gewesen. Anfang Juni 2019 waren Hunderttausende zum ersten Mal auf die Straße gegangen, um gegen eine Gesetzesänderung zu protestieren die es erlauben würde, Verdächtige und Straftäter unkompliziert an China auszuliefern. Kelvin war dabei – auch als Hongkonger Polizisten zum ersten Mal massiv gegen Demonstranten vorgingen, am 12. Juni. Es war ein früher Wendepunkt, nach dem sich der zunächst friedliche Protest radikal veränderte. Beide Seiten rüsteten auf: die Polizei mit noch mehr Tränengas, Gummigeschossen, Wasserwerfern und Knüppeln; die meist jungen Demonstranten mit Molotowcocktails und professioneller Ausrüstung. Straßen wurden zu Schlachtfeldern, wöchentlich.\nHarte Urteile\nKelvin arbeitet unter der Woche in einer Anwaltskanzlei. Als Assistent kümmert er sich um Fälle junger Demonstranten, die wegen Waffenbesitzes verurteilt werden sollen. Stundenlang schaut er sich Aufnahmen von Überwachungskameras an, um genau sagen zu können, was wann wie in einer Auseinandersetzung mit der Polizei geschah. Er sagt, er sei froh, diese Arbeit tun zu können, selbst wenn es nicht immer gerecht zugehe. Weil manche Richter Verfahren beschleunigten, um die Leute schnell verurteilen zu können; weil viele sich im Zweifel immer für das härtere Urteil entschieden. „Letzte Woche“, sagt er, „wurde eine 23-Jährige zu zwölf Monaten Gefängnis verurteilt, weil sie einem Demonstranten half, Molotowcocktails zu tragen.“\nDie Nachrichtenagentur Reuters schrieb kürzlich von rund 7000 Menschen, die während der sieben Monate andauernden Proteste verhaftet wurden. Nach Angaben von Polizeichef Chris Tang seien davon 1092 verurteilt worden. Die meisten der vom 9. Juni bis zum 14. November 2019 Festgenommenen waren laut Reuters zwischen 21 und 25 Jahre alt, der Großteil von ihnen ist männlich. Ein halbes Jahr Proteste haben nicht nur die Stadt zweigeteilt in Befürworter und Gegner Pekings, sondern auch Familien zerrissen. Der Konflikt ist auch einer zwischen Generationen, die Jugend denkt gelb, die Großeltern blau.\nAngst vor Verfolgung\nSo ist es zum Beispiel bei der 23-jährigen Dawn. Auch sie nennt ihren echten Namen aus Angst vor Verfolgung nicht. Seit Monaten vermeidet sie die Konfrontation mit Verwandten, die dem chinesischen Staat die Treue halten. Wie ihr über-80-jähriger Großvater. Erst Verwandtschaft vom Festland schaffte es, ihm seine Reisepläne für das Neujahrsfest auszureden. Bis dahin glaubte er, die Kommunistische Partei habe den Ausbruch des Coronavirus unter Kontrolle. Auch sie hat zu Neujahr ihre Familie besucht. Weil die Verwandtschaft das Essen bei einem blauen Restaurant bestellte, orderte sie zusätzlich bei einem gelben. Der Eklat blieb aus – weil ausnahmsweise alle über das Coronavirus sprachen und nicht über Politik. Den Eltern sendet sie regelmäßig Listen „erlaubter“ Läden. Manchmal, sagt sie, hielten die sich daran. Für sie ist das, wie auch für Kelvin, keine Frage. „Ich habe es mir angewöhnt, nachzusehen, bevor ich einen Laden betrete.“ Wobei die gelben auch ohne App zu erkennen seien, sagt sie und lacht: an den Schlangen vor den Türen!\nPer Whatsapp schickt Dawn Links zu den Apps, die sie nutzt. Die Stadtkarten sind übersät mit gelben, blauen und einigen roten Punkten – Achtung: festlandchinesisches Kapital! Ein McDonald’s im Bezirk Pok Fu Lam ist blau gekennzeichnet, ein Fenster mit Begründungen öffnet sich nach einem Klick. Darunter jene: Am 25. August 2019 wurden dort Gutscheine an Polizisten ausgegeben. Das Restaurant Meat Pie Gor in Tai Wai ist gelb. Die Besitzer haben sich auf die Seite der Demonstranten gestellt. Oder Sogno Gelato, der berühmte Eisladen in einer Shopping-Mall in Tsuen Wan, der keine Polizisten bedient; der als Form des Protests Ende des Jahres eine eigene Kreation verkaufte, Geschmacksrichtung Tränengas – mit schwarzem Pfeffer.\nAn der Lennon-Wall\nNach welchen Standards die Läden bewertet werden, wird in der Hongkonger Schwarmintelligenz andauernd diskutiert. Hat sich der Besitzer regierungsfreundlich geäußert? Sind die Unternehmer nachweislich Pro-Peking? Es war es schon lange nicht mehr so leicht, Teil einer Revolution zu sein, wenn das bloß bedeutet, den Kaffee im richtigen Café zu kaufen. Dawn erzählt von Leuten, die von Polizisten zusammengeschlagen wurden, als sie bunte Post-its mit Wünschen und Forderungen an die sogenannten Lennon-Walls klebten, die überall in Hongkong an Gebäuden, Unterführungen und Geschäftsfassaden entstanden. Schon 2014, bei der Regenschirmbewegung hatte es die gegeben. Ihr Vorbild steht in Prag, wo eine Wand als Ausdruck des Protests gegen das kommunistische Regime seit den 1960er-Jahren mit Graffiti und Sprüchen bemalt wurde. „Wir wissen nicht, was uns passieren kann, wenn wir unsere Meinung öffentlich äußern“, sagt Dawn. „In der gelben Wirtschaft können wir uns frei und sicher fühlen.“\nDawn hat bis Mitte Januar als Sozialarbeiterin gearbeitet. Nacht für Nacht war sie unterwegs zu obdachlosen Jugendlichen, zu Ausreißern und Drogenabhängigen. Je intensiver die Proteste wurden, desto häufiger dienten sie und ihr Team mit Minivan auch als Revolutionstaxi. Schnell brachten sie die jungen Demonstranten aus der Gefahrenzone oder nach Hause, als irgendwann nach 22 Uhr keine U-Bahn mehr fuhr. Was sie erlebte und sah, ließ sie nicht unberührt. Sie bekam Panikattacken und konnte nicht mehr schlafen. Noch heute hat sie Magenprobleme. Dawns Arbeit war nicht ohne Risiko, zur Hochzeit der Proteste nahm die Hongkonger Polizei auch Ersthelfer und Sozialarbeiter fest.\nUrlaub in Australien\nBevor sie sich einen neuen Job sucht, wird sie verreisen: zwei Wochen Australien im Februar. Sie wird Freundinnen begleiten, Krankenschwestern, die ihren Urlaub als Forschungsaufenthalt verstehen. Sie wollen herausfinden, ob sie sich ein Leben in Australien vorstellen könnten. Ein bisschen will Dawn das auch. „Ganz ehrlich“, sagt sie, „hier möchte ich keine Kinder bekommen, denn ich könnte ihnen kein gutes Leben garantieren, keine Demokratie, keine Freiheit und nicht die Möglichkeit, zu tun was sie wollen.“ Ihr Freund denke genauso. „Rational glauben wir, dass Auswandern für uns das beste ist. Nur emotional schaffen wir es noch nicht.“\nAuch für Kelvin ist Auswandern eine realistische Option. An den Wochenenden lernt er nun wieder für sein Studium, um mit einem baldigen Abschluss die bestmöglichen Chancen in einem anderen Land zu haben. Seine Eltern, die „gelb“ denken, so wie er, überlegen nach Taiwan zu ziehen. Bis es soweit sein könnte, werde der tägliche Protest Teil ihres Lebens sein. „Wir warten auf den richtigen Moment, die chinesische Regierung zu überwältigen“, sagt Kelvin. „Wir sind jederzeit bereit, wieder auf die Straße zu gehen.“\n"}, {"content": "hsa appeals for blood donors as stock dips to low or critical levels during covid-19 outbreak. SINGAPORE — With Singapore’s blood banks closely watching the screening of donors during the coronavirus outbreak, the authorities are appealing for healthy donors to give blood because stocks have dipped to low or critical levels. \n In response to TODAY’s enquiries on Friday (Feb 14), the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), which manages Singapore’s blood banks, said: “Our blood stocks are currently trending downwards. We, therefore, strongly urge donors who are healthy and eligible to step forward as our patients really need your support during this challenging period.” \n With extra precautions in place, such as stringent screening of donors before they are allowed into the blood banks, HSA said that the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus, Covid-19, while giving blood is assessed to be low. \n The Singapore Red Cross said on its website that on Friday, stocks for the A+, B+, O+ and AB+ blood types were at “critical” levels, and those for the A-, B-, O- and AB- blood types were “low”. \n When blood stocks are at the critical level, this means that donors are urgently needed and urged to donate on the same day. \n For blood types where stocks are low, donors are urged to donate within the week. \n HSA said that blood is needed every day to support the needs of patients in Singapore, and that it was important to maintain at least six days of blood stock at all times for daily transfusion needs and bleeding emergencies. \n Last year, there were 75,655 blood donors, or just 1.87 per cent of the resident population. \n NO EVIDENCE CORONAVIRUS CAN SPREAD THROUGH BLOOD \n For now, there is no evidence that Covid-19 can be transmitted through blood, HSA said. \n Even so, the authority has put in place a slew of measures to ensure the safety of the blood supply and the health of its donors. \n Since last Friday — when Singapore raised its disease outbreak response code to Orange — HSA has been screening potential donors and their companions for fever or respiratory symptoms, such as cough or runny nose, and their travels to mainland China, before they can enter the blood banks or mobile donation drives.   \n Those who are unwell, on leave of absence or have been to China in the last 14 days will be barred entry. \n Apart from beefing up the screening of donors, HSA said that staff members were monitoring their temperatures twice daily, and have been told to wear masks and see a doctor if they have fever or respiratory symptoms. \n “To further assure our donors, we have also increased the frequency of cleaning to ensure the cleanliness standards of our blood banks,” HSA added. \n INFECTED DONORS TO BE DEFERRED \n As for donors who have Covid-19 infection, their donations will be deferred until more information becomes available, HSA said. \n “They will only be allowed to donate blood when there is more medical data to indicate when it is safe for donors who have recovered from the novel coronavirus infection to donate blood again,” it added. \n Blood donors told TODAY that they would continue to give blood, although one donor is concerned about visiting the blood banks. \n Undergraduate Tan Hui Lin, 24, who last donated blood in 2018, said that the blood banks are in areas where people tend to congregate. \n HSA’s four blood banks are in Outram, Dhoby Ghaut, Woodlands and Jurong East. \n “Most of us would avoid crowded places… there’s high inertia to actually leave the house,” Ms Tan said, although she added that she would donate blood if the supply is low. \n Mr Shahroull Khairoullah, 29, a painting company owner who gives blood every three months, said that he would not do so for now because he has been coughing for the past few weeks. \n Business development manager Chan Si Yong, 27, said that HSA’s added precautions were helpful, even though screening procedures were already stringent before the virus outbreak. \n Donors have to fill in a health questionnaire and be checked by a medical screener, he said. “If you are unwell, they will turn you down.” \n Public servant Andrew Wilfred, 33, said that the coronavirus outbreak would not deter him from donating blood. \n “I trust that the nurses are doing their best to maintain the high standards of hygiene that they have always done.” \n For information on where to go for blood donation and the blood banks' opening hours, go to HSA's website or the Singapore Red Cross' website. \n "}, {"content": "Associação garante que ginásios \"estão preparados\" para surto de coronavírus.

SINGAPORE — A person’s physical and mental health get messed up on a regular basis when he or she travels frequently for work, and the latest coronavirus epidemic is not helping matters presently. \n Mental health issues are predicted to be one of the top 10 risks that business travellers will face this year. This is based on the latest Travel Risks Outlook 2020 report by global travel risk management company International SOS. \n Yet, these issues remain an overlooked aspect of business travel, especially in today’s hypermobile work climate. \n Dr Low Kiang Wei, medical director of International SOS, said that not only does business travel take a toll on physical health, it also affects individuals on a psychological level due to factors such as time spent apart from loved ones, blurred lines between work and after-work hours, and anxiety due to unexpected increases in workload. \n Navigating travel risks such as natural disasters or epidemics can add on to the stress. \n Infectious diseases outbreaks are also one of the risks highlighted in International SOS’ report. \n So far, health officials in China have confirmed more than 31,000 cases of the new coronavirus, with more than 4,800 of them considered severe. The disease, which causes pneumonia in its severe form, has claimed the lives of more than 630 people in China. \n The virus, also known as 2019-nCov, has also sickened more than 200 people in at least 20 countries. In Singapore, two patients who are warded are under intensive care. \n Dr Low said of the anxiety that travellers face: “Without appropriate pre-trip awareness, risk mitigation advice, access to 24/7 assistance in case of emergencies such as natural disasters or epidemics, business travellers can also feel unnecessarily stressed about their own safety.” \n Even with the appropriate preparations, an evolving and escalating situation such as the current coronavirus epidemic can considerably increase a traveller’s stress, he added. \n “There is an element of the unknown and situations can change quickly. \n “In these circumstances, it is important to provide access to timely, accurate, verified information. Travellers and assignees can also feel increasingly isolated and vulnerable,” Dr Low said. \n Dr Edwin Ong, resident doctor at DTAP Clinic in Siglap, said that stress and anxiety levels can rise when faced with the increased possibility of close contact and exposure to infected travellers, especially when heading to countries that have confirmed the presence of the virus. \n “Business travellers may feel that they are putting their health and well-being at risk by having to travel during this unsafe period, and this could weigh down tremendously on their overall mental health,” he said. \n WHAT BUSINESS CLIENTS ARE ASKING \n Ms Wynne Wee, vice-president of Asia Pacific at Workplace Options, which provides employee wellbeing solutions, said that her team has received “a significant number” of requests from companies, partners and individuals in the Asia-Pacific region seeking support during this period. \n However, she added it is too soon to ascertain if the increase in calls is specifically due to the coronavirus outbreak. \n Ms Wee said that clients in the management level who ask for support are concerned about how they can support their teams sensitively in these times while maintaining healthy business outcomes. \n Ms Wee, who is a trained counselling psychologist, said: “As with everyone else, the same fears (about the new coronavirus) holds true for business travellers, but we can imagine how this fear may be elevated for those who are still required to continue with essential business travel. \n “On the other hand, if they’re told that travel is put off, this will also have an impact on how one feels about their job security which leads to different concerns.” \n WHAT ONE BUSINESS TRAVELLER IS DOING \n For one frequent flier from Singapore, Ms Syahidah Y, she has greater freedom as the founder of makeup brand Molly Cosmetics to adjust her business travel plans. \n With no obvious end in sight to the outbreak, she has made a self-imposed “semi travel ban” and will limit her business travels to just Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and Myanmar. \n Otherwise, she also usually flies to China, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan for work at least twice a month. \n Her hectic business travel schedules often leave her feeling weary and fatigued.  \n “Work travel is not as glamorous as people make it out to be,” she said. \n “Sure, there are the comforts of travelling in business (class) or staying in fancy hotels, but in reality, the need to be in ‘work mode’ once you get off the plane, constantly be on your toes and be expected to perform your best for work activities — these affect you mentally.” \n It can also get lonely, she added. “There’s limited time in a day. After dealing with work during your travel, you don’t have much time to ‘enjoy’.”  \n HOW WORK TRAVEL MESSES WITH THE MIND \n Dr Ong of DTAP clinic said that the mind and body are interdependent, and neither aspect of health should be ignored. \n “Often times, a much stronger emphasis is placed on physical health instead, such as sleep interruptions from jet lag, unhealthy eating and drinking and lack of exercise. \n “However, if left undiagnosed and untreated, mental health issues can fester and worsen in severity, which in turn lead to the very same physical health issues that we are trying to avoid.” \n For instance, long distance or frequent travel affects the body’s natural circadian rhythm, which is responsible for regulating sleep patterns. \n Poor or little sleep in turn causes increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which can lead to the development or worsening of mental illness such as depression or anxiety, Dr Ong said. \n In a separate 2018 study, commissioned by the International SOS Foundation, stress, depression, emotional exhaustion and heightened anxiety were reported in a large proportion of international business travellers. \n Almost half, or 45 per cent, of the respondents, reported an increase in stress levels. About a quarter reported heightened depression (27 per cent) and heightened anxiety (23 per cent). \n About 31 per cent experienced emotional exhaustion — a core feature of burnout — on a weekly basis, while 41 per cent reported that their mood suffers during business trips, Dr Low said. \n Dr Ong warned that unaddressed mental health issues as a result of work travel can create a ripple effect on other aspects of the person’s life, such as work performance, relationships and social life. \n There are consequences on a larger scale, too. \n HOW IT AFFECTS BUSINESS COSTS \n “Medical claims for mental and physical health issues lead to increased costs for employers. Reduced work performance, absence from work and short-term disability can result in decreased revenue,” Dr Ong said. \n Yet, Dr Low pointed out that only 15 per cent of organisations surveyed in market research company Ipsos Mori’s Business Resilience Trends 2020 include mental health issues in their travel policies. \n He said: “This figure is worrying, given that there are increasing studies and accounts of business travellers suffering from mental health issues. \n “Business travel is likely to continue in the coming year, and it is important for businesses to build a holistic and preventive culture of health to protect the wellbeing of their workforce.”  \n WHAT COMPANIES CAN DO \n Dr Low said that efforts to address mental health in the workplace need to begin at the C-suite, or management level, and trickle down to the frontline employee. \n International SOS, for example, has in place a range of employee mental health initiatives. It includes the use of an assistance mobile application for employees to receive updates on destination risks as well as briefings on their travel destination, if required from the medical and security teams. \n This has been especially useful in the current coronavirus outbreak situation. \n “Travellers are able to ‘check in’ (via the app) to let their employer know where they are, and to allow monitoring of travel patterns. It also allows tailored advice based on their travel to be proactively pushed out,” Dr Low said. \n “For example, a traveller can be alerted to review or change their routing based on alerts or messages being pushed out. \n “Managers can also review daily travel patterns to proactively push out information to their staff. As this (2019-nCov) crisis has evolved, so has our health information — it’s key that travellers have access to the very latest guidance to help allay their concerns.” \n  Having updated and useful information at hand can help take away some of the anxiety that travellers have. Photo: Media Raw Stock \n From this month onwards, International SOS employees in Singapore will also be able to dial in to a helpline for professional counselling or talk about their emotional concerns. This phone service, done in partnership with Workplace Options, is now in operation in its China and Europe offices. \n Workplace Options recommends that all companies assess their employee’s fitness and suitability for business travel before giving out work travel assignments. \n Ms Wee said: “Not everyone is cut out for business travel, which can take a huge toll on (a person’s mental health). Having the right fitness, mindset and resilience is important to ensure wellbeing and effective outcomes of business travel.” \n Dr Low said other practices that organisations can put in place to protect their employees’ mental health include: \n 1. Having mental health monitoring aside from physical health checks before and after travels \n Ensure that any post-trip feedback surveys include not just logistics, but feedback on mental health and psychological experience. \n 2. Build an organisational restitution culture \n Encourage business travellers to build rest and recovery into their schedule while on the trip and after returning. Enable flexible work schedules for recovery; this may include working from home or taking prolonged weekends. \n 3. Consider adding employee assistance programmes \n This may include 24/7 access to at least telephonic emotional support, and wellness programmes. \n 4. Make the trips as seamless as possible \n For instance, if they encounter a health or medical issue while overseas and late at night, do they know who to easily call or visit for immediate help? \n "}, {"content": "Coronavirus pandemic: How the world has dealt with Covid-19, could it have done better?. It looks like a world war against a virus. The novel coronavirus which has acquired pandemic scale both in its spread and declaration by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Now, for the first time, the rest of the world has more coronavirus cases than China, the source region.\nThe total number of Covid-19 patients in the world has crossed 1.67 lakh with China accounting for less than 82,000, according to WHO's latest report. While the world reported 13,903 cases in preceding 24 hours. Only 29 of these were reported from China.\nThe WHO has already declared Europe as the new epicentre of coronavirus pandemic. Incidentally, it was only after the theatre of pandemic shifted from oriental landscape to Europe that the more dominant powers appeared serious in tackling the contagion. Here is an account of how the world has dealt with coronavirus pandemic.\nINSULATION\nThe United States has suspended all flights from Europe. President Donald Trump is expected to declare national emergency. Many European countries such as Germany, France and Britain have followed a similar strategy to insulate themselves. This method has worked for many less developed countries such as Magnolia, which is surrounded by China from three sides, North Korea, located like cheese between the slices of South Korea and China, two of the worst affected countries in the world.\nIndia too imposed massive travel restrictions. India began screening of passengers coming to India in the final week of February. The vigil was up not only at airports but also at the sea ports. The government said more than 27,000 people were not allowed to land in India at sea ports as the paths of the ships had crossed coronavirus affected countries.\nIn nut shell, country-quantine is the most preferred method adopted by various governments to check spread of Covid-19.\nCovid-19 is a pandemic both in its scale of spread and by the declaration of the WHO. However, it is peculiar that there has not been attempts by leading countries to devise a common and coordinated strategy to fight the contagion.\nChina called for international cooperation in early February. The WHO too called for a concerted global effort. But all countries ultimately devised their own specific strategy to deal with coronavirus spread.\nWhen the Donald Trump administration suspended flight operations from Europe, the decision was criticised for having been unilateral in nature. Italy, Iran and other worse affected countries felt constrained in dealing with the crisis leading to sudden spike in the cases of Covid-19.\nIndia, however, showed some initiative recently with Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosting a video-conference with the leaders of the Saarc. Decision was taken to create a Saarc fund to fight coronavirus spread. Such attempts taken in the initial days might have kept the novel coronavirus in check to a large extent.\nAnother tactic reportedly adopted by some countries was of underreporting and covering up the coronavirus outbreak. It began with China.\nFor first two months -- now the first victims of novel coronavirus have been traced back to November 2019 against previously set starting point of mid-December 2019 -- China refused to acknowledge the Covid-19 outbreak.\nThe doctor who first went public with the reporting of coronavirus outbreak was severely reprimanded by the Chinese government. The first health workers alerting the officials and asking people to beware of this contagion were also reportedly warned for \"rumour mongering\".\nLater, that doctor died. Chinese media said he died of Covid-19. This all happened despite Chinese President Xi Jinping telling the public that anyone found hiding the truth would be severely dealt with. Recently, an old aide of Xi Jinping went missing after he criticised the Chinese government for its handling of coronavirus pandemic.\nA pattern of cover-up was also seen in Italy and Iran, the two worst affected countries outside the source zone in China-Hong Kong-South Korea. Italian authorities are said to have dismissed the reports of coronavirus in initial days. They responded only after the situation spiralled out of control. The health infrastructure was found to be inadequate in the country. Same has been the case with Iran, which has already been reeling under the impact of multiple sanctions.\nIn India, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Modi government was in stupor as coronavirus caused havoc in the country. This was an allegation of cover up. Though, the government has been coming out with daily updates on the matter. The government has said that it is on the top of coronavirus situation in the country.\nCoronavirus pandemic has challenged the human capital of the world. In equal measure if not more is the pressure that the governments are feeling over their economic capital. The full scale economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic is still unknowns but economic boosters are already being announced.\nThe US Federal Reserve has cut down the interest rate to zero, and announced a mega $700 billion quantitative easing programme as the economy reels under the coronavirus pressure.\nThe UK has slashed interest rates on loans for small and medium businesses. Germany has announced tax cuts. Australia has announced to pump billions of dollars in its market to avoid coronavirus-induced slowdown.\nItaly announced a $28 billion dollar package to strengthen its health infrastructure. The European Commission followed the similar suit. Iran, for the first time in nealy six decades asked for money from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nIn India, the Reserve Bank of India has decided to infuse Rs 1 lakh crore in the market to fight off adverse impact of coronavirus pandemic on Indian businesses. The RBI has not altered the regular banking duties but asked the customers to do more digital transactions to avoid contact with bank employees and keep less pressure on the banking staff.\n"}, {"content": "Darle la vuelta. La irrupción de la nueva epidemia de coronavirus pilló por sorpresa a los máximos dirigentes chinos, de gira de inspección por varias provincias. La alerta alteró inevitablemente su agenda y la de millones de chinos que se aprestaban a disfrutar de sus días de fiesta más preciados. El brote de la neumonía todavía se halla en la etapa temprana y es comprensible la preocupación por su evolución. En el nuevo Año de la Rata, ¿se convertirá el nuevo coronavirus en una especie de ratonera para el Partido Comunista de China (PCCh)?\nEl PCCh ha tomado las riendas de la crisis. Primero fue la comisión central de asuntos políticos y jurídicos poniendo en guardia a los funcionarios del Partido y del Gobierno contra la tentación de disimular la gravedad de la situación. Tras la crisis del SARS de 2003, se ha comprendido que la opacidad constituye un error mayúsculo que no hace sino agravar el problema. La oportuna, precisa y transparente información parece haberse instituido como norma en este caso. Después, el Comité Permanente del Buró Político emitió la consigna del control del nuevo coronavirus como la prioridad máxima sobre cualquier otro asunto.\nAl desafío de salud pública que supone enfrentar una crisis de estas proporciones en un país, a pesar de todo, en vías de desarrollo, con una cifra de muertos que se acerca al centenar y miles de afectados, al PCCh se le suma igualmente un desafío político. La preservación de la estabilidad social sigue siendo una prioridad. Al desconcierto del primer momento le siguieron las críticas por la lentitud de la reacción inicial. Las autoridades han sido expeditivas e implacables en la adopción de medidas enérgicas y sin precedentes y esto las ha acallado. Al menos, por ahora.\nSin opción a titubeos, el PCCh tensiona los músculos para demostrar su invencibilidad. Lejos de amilanarse, la consigna apunta a dar la vuelta a la crisis, convirtiéndola en una demostración palpable de su aptitud para encarar los más graves retos, cualquiera que estos sean. Un mensaje dirigido tanto a la sociedad china como al resto del mundo, incluso en el orden científico, con exhibición de capacidad y competencia para hallar respuestas rápidas, en otro tiempo quizá imposible. China aún no se puede comparar con Occidente en muchos parámetros, pero ya quisiera Occidente poder disponer de su capacidad para yugular una crisis de estas proporciones, sugiere Xi Jinping. Ese convencimiento inspira el proceder del PCCh en estas horas difíciles, una invocación a ese nacionalismo que cierra filas pero que no puede pasar por alto que esta es la segunda vez que ocurre. No puede haber una tercera.\nEste es un año de gran importancia para el PCCh. En 2021 celebrará el primer centenario de su fundación. Quería presentar al mundo un país en estado de revista. Su máxima aspiración es proclamar a los cuatro vientos que ha logrado hacer de China una sociedad próspera y acomodada, un país respetado en el mundo.

La epidemia de coronavirus de Wuhan amenaza, cada vez más, con convertirse en un nuevo elemento de fricción -uno más- en las complicadas relaciones entre Estados Unidos y China. Pekín ha dejado claro su malestar sobre el modo en que Washington ha reaccionado ante la mayor catástrofe que vive el país asiático en años. Medidas como la suspensión de vuelos o veto a los viajeros procedentes de China solo sirven, según el Gobierno del presidente Xi Jinping, para “crear y propagar el miedo”.\nEs la segunda ocasión, en apenas tres días, en que Pekín ha dejado clara su irritación por lo que considera una reacción exagerada de la primera potencia. Este lunes, en una rueda de prensa ofrecida a través de internet -como parte de las medidas para evitar aglomeraciones y prevenir contagios-, la portavoz del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores, Hua Chunying, acusó a Washington de que, además de dar el pistoletazo de salida a una carrera mundial por cerrar fronteras y tráfico aéreo, “todavía no ha ofrecido ninguna ayuda sustancial a la parte china”.\nLa epidemia dista aún de estar bajo control en China. Los fallecidos ya suman 425, más que los 348 que dejó el SARS en este país en 2003. Los infectados son ya más de 19.000, de los que al menos 2.296 se encuentran en estado grave, según las cifras divulgadas este martes a primera hora.\nY va a tener consecuencias duraderas. Este lunes, la Comisión Nacional de Reforma y Desarrollo, el todopoderoso organismo encargado de la planificación económica en China, reconocía que dejará un grave efecto negativo en la economía del país, en especial en el sector del consumo. En su reapertura tras el Año Nuevo lunar, el batacazo de las Bolsas pese a la promesa del Banco Central de una inyección de liquidez por 154.000 millones de euros para paliar el efecto de la epidemia servía de anticipo: el principal indicador de la Bolsa de Shanghái, el SSE, caía más de un 7,7%, el mayor desplome desde 2015, mientras que el segundo parqué chino, el de Shenzhen, perdía un 8,41%.\nPero en los datos oficiales empiezan a aparecer señales de esperanza, a los que se aferran Pekín y los ciudadanos chinos y que los medios estatales difunden con entusiasmo. El número de recuperados, 477 según los números de la Comisión Nacional de Sanidad, supera desde este fin de semana al de fallecidos. Los casos de contagio fuera de Hubei, la provincia foco de la epidemia, también disminuyen desde hace dos días, un posible indicio de que las drásticas medidas que ha impuesto el Gobierno central contra la propagación del virus empiezan a surtir efecto.\nEsos “brotes verdes” alimentan el enfado de Pekín hacia cómo ha respondido Estados Unidos, con demasiada precipitación desde su punto de vista. La guerra comercial y tecnológica, en pausa tras la firma de un acuerdo de primera fase en diciembre, convenció al Gobierno de Xi de que ha comenzado una nueva “guerra fría”, en la que el objetivo final de Washington es impedir el auge de China. Pekín interpreta ahora el comportamiento de EE. UU en esta epidemia como otro intento más de tratar de debilitarla. La Casa Blanca responde que su comportamiento se debe a razones de salud pública.\n“En un mundo globalizado, los destinos de todos los países están estrechamente vinculados. Frente a una crisis de salud pública, los países deberían colaborar para superar las dificultades en vez de recurrir a empobrecer al vecino, y mucho menos aprovecharse de las dificultades de los demás”, ha arremetido Hua. El fin de semana, la portavoz ya había sostenido en un comunicado que los actos de Washington “no son un gesto de buena voluntad”.\nEE. UU, que ha confirmado nueve contagios en su suelo, fue el primer país que anunció que repatriaría a sus nacionales atrapados en Wuhan, origen de la epidemia, después de que esa ciudad de once millones de habitantes impuso el día 23 una súbita cuarentena que bloqueó todos sus accesos. Hasta el momento ha evacuado a cerca de 200 ciudadanos, la mayor parte funcionarios consulares, y espera organizar una segunda operación de rescate.\nDesde este domingo, y tras declarar una \"emergencia de sanidad pública\", están cerradas sus fronteras a cualquier extranjero sin vínculos familiares con ciudadanos o residentes permanentes de EEUU y que haya estado en China en las dos semanas previas a su llegada (catorce días es el tiempo máximo de incubación). Además, las líneas aéreas de Estados Unidos también han suspendido temporalmente sus vuelos, al menos hasta finales de marzo.\nEl presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, ha declarado en una entrevista a la cadena de televisión Fox News que \"les hemos ofrecido una ayuda tremenda (a China), somos los mejores del mundo para eso. Pero no podemos tener a miles de personas entrando que pudieran tener este problema, el coronavirus”. “Básicamente, hemos echado el cierre para que no entre desde China”. La Casa Blanca también ha lamentado que Pekín no haya aceptado, hasta el momento, su oferta de enviar especialistas de salud pública de sus Centros de Control y Prevención de Enfermedades.\nMás allá de los reproches, el coronavirus puede tener otros efectos en la relación entre China y Estados Unidos, advierten los expertos. El impacto económico de la crisis y la atención que exige a los líderes chinos puede complicar que Pekín cumpla los compromisos de fuertes aumentos en sus importaciones de productos agrícolas, energéticos y manufactureros procedentes de EE.UU. “Las restricciones de viaje y los cierres de fronteras como mínimo lastrarán la logística para cumplir esos objetivos”, apunta el analista Michael Hirson, de la consultora Eurasia Group, en una nota.\nSi la epidemia motiva un descenso prolongado de la cotización del yuan frente al dólar —estos días ha cruzado la frontera clave de los siete yuanes por dólar—, “Trump puede retomar sus críticas contra China acerca de su política de tipo de cambio”, apunta Hirson.\n"}, {"content": "China to lift lockdown over Covid-19 epicentres amid warnings of second wave. China on Tuesday decided to lift the three-month lockdown on more than 56 million people in the central Hubei province, the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, on Wednesday amid warnings by experts of a looming second wave of the Covid-19 infections in the country due to the steady rise in \"imported cases\".\nThe prolonged lockdown of Hubei's capital Wuhan will end on April 8, lifting the mass quarantine over the city with a population of over 11 million.\nWuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus cases were first detected in December last year on Monday reported one new confirmed case of the Covid-19 after reporting zero cases for five consecutive days.\nHubei province and Wuhan city which together have over 56 million population were kept under strict lockdown since January 23 with a ban on all movement of people and transportation.\nChina is embarking on a major step to open up its coronavirus epicentres just as India and the world is seriously grappling with the fast-paced spread of the disease which has become a global pandemic forcing most of the countries to go into a lockdown mode.\nPeople in Wuhan will be allowed to leave the city and Hubei Province, if they hold a green health code, meaning no contact with any infected or suspected Covid-19 cases, according to a circular issued by the provincial Covid-19 control headquarters, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.\nWuhan will take differentiated measures to promote the resumption of business operations based on the health risks of different regions to mitigate the impact on the economy, the circular said.\nOther areas in Hubei will lift outbound transportation restrictions from Wednesday. Migrant workers who hold green cards and get negative nucleic acid testing results will be sent out of the province to their workplace directly.\nOn January 23, Wuhan declared unprecedented traffic restrictions, including suspending the city's public transport and all outbound flights and trains, in an attempt to contain the epidemic within its territory. Similar restrictions were soon introduced in other areas in Hubei.\nLocal officials announced plans to gradually ease the severe measures as the virus cases dropped dramatically in recent days.\nHubei, however saw seven new deaths on Monday, all of which were in Wuhan, bringing the total number of deaths in the province to 3,160.\nThe province still has 4,200 patients being treated in hospitals of which 1,203 were still in severe condition and another 336 in critical condition, according to China's National Health Commission.\nHubei has so far reported a total of 67,801 confirmed Covid-19 cases, including 50,006 in Wuhan reflecting on the intensity with which the vicious virus, reportedly emerged from a local live animal market in the city shook the province.\nOn Tuesday, the NHC reported 78 new confirmed cases, including 74 imported infections taking their total to 427.\nThe overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland has reached 81,171 by the end of Monday. This included 3,277 people who died of the disease, 4,735 patients who were still being treated and 73,159 patients discharged after recovery, the NHC said on Tuesday.\nWhile the gradual opening of Hubei province will enable its over 56 million to emerge out of the strict lockdown which also effectively shielded the grim stories of their suffering, there are apprehensions highlighted in the Chinese official media about how they will be received in the rest of the country considering the stigmatisation of the areas with Covid-19 and its deadly nature of transmission.\nAs the virus emerged in Wuhan, several foreign countries, including India, has evacuated their nationals and subjected them to stringent quarantine procedures to ensure the virus is not spread back home.\nAlso as China appeared eager to reopen the country starting factories and business to make up for the lost time, Chinese experts warned of a possible second wave of the Covid-19 virus attack.\nThe total number of imported cases of the virus reached 427 on Tuesday as a large number of overseas Chinese especially in countries like Italy which have now emerged as the new Covid-19 epicentres arrived back home.\nLoopholes in screening processes at customs and inadequate quarantine measures upon entry into the Chinese cities as well as a high proportion of asymptomatic cases are making the second wave of novel coronavirus outbreak highly likely, even inevitable, as the global pandemic continues to worsen, state-run Global Times reported on Tuesday.\nAlthough a drop in new cases is reported on a daily basis, all new cases now are imported infections, sparking serious concerns over a looming second outbreak in China, it said.\nChina's epidemiologist Li Lanjuan told media here on Monday that China still faces a severe situation currently due to the surge in imported cases from other countries and regions.\n\"China is already facing the risk of a second outbreak as the number of imported cases already reached a small peak,\" Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told the Global Times.\nHowever, various Chinese medical experts believed that a second outbreak is unlikely, considering the country's stringent measures and experiences during the past two months in combating the disease.\n"}, {"content": "singapore airlines to cut flights as covid-19 outbreak hits demand. SYDNEY — Singapore Airlines will temporarily cut flights across its global network in the three months to May, it said on Tuesday (Feb 18), as a coronavirus outbreak hits demand for services to the Singapore and its through its key transit hub. \n Key affected destinations include Frankfurt, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, Mumbai, Paris, Seoul, Sydney and Tokyo, the airline said on its website. \n \"Singapore Airlines and SilkAir will temporarily reduce services across our network due to weak demand as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak,\" the carrier said. \n \"We will continue to monitor the situation and make further adjustments as necessary.\" \n It declined to say what percentage of capacity it had cut in response to a query from Reuters, citing commercial sensitivity. \n The cuts follow major reductions already announced in services to mainland China and Hong Kong. In the December quarter, flights to mainland China made up 11 per cent of capacity for the airline, and more than that for budget arm Scoot. \n \"It's not a surprise to see some cuts in flights, given the weak forward bookings that can be expected from the current environment,\" said DBS analyst Paul Yong. \n Demand on flights to South Korea and Japan had been hit hardest after China, Mr Yong quoted Singapore Airlines' management team as having told analysts at a results briefing on Monday. \n Those were the areas of the biggest cutbacks in Tuesday's announcement. \n Singapore's tally of 77 cases of the Covid-19 virus is one of the highest outside mainland China, where more than 1,800 people have been killed in the epidemic. \n Last week, the Asian tourism and travel hub said it expected visitor numbers to drop by a quarter or more this year, hit by the virus outbreak. \n Besides visitors to the city-state, Singapore Airlines also relies heavily on transit traffic. Premium travel has suffered after many business events were cancelled across Asia because of the virus. \n Hong Kong-based rival Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd has said it is cutting 40 per cent of capacity across its network, up from 30 per cent earlier, due to weak demand.

SHANGHAI (REUTERS) - The existence of a substantial but unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that people could still be spreading Covid-19 without knowing they are sick. \n As the virus continues to wreak havoc across the world, China is close to declaring victory and is already easing travel restrictions. \n The border of Hubei province, epicentre of the virus, opened on Wednesday (March 25) after a two-month shutdown. \n But there are concerns that the end of the lockdown will release thousands of infectious people back into circulation. \n Asymptomatic cases present a huge challenge in the control of infectious diseases, making it harder to detect and stop transmission. \n In China, the number of known asymptomatic cases is classified, and it is not included in the official data, though the South China Morning Post, citing unpublished official documents, recently said it was more than 40,000. \n China had reported 81,218 coronavirus cases, and 3,281 deaths by the end of Tuesday. \n Asymptomatic cases are currently found through \"contact tracing\". China identifies people exposed to someone with a confirmed diagnosis, and if they test positive, they are quarantined whether or not they manifest symptoms. \n \"Asymptomatic patients have all been discovered during our contact tracing,\" said Dr Wu Zunyou of the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention at a briefing on Tuesday. \n \"So will they be able to create transmission? They won't.\" \n Still, the failure to include them in the official data has raised concerns about Beijing's commitment to transparency, and some experts say it could also create a misleading picture about how the epidemic spreads and whether or not it is under control. \n Despite recording zero new infections from last Wednesday to Sunday, the Covid-19 hot spot city of Wuhan disclosed last Friday that one newly diagnosed case was not included in the official data because the patient, a 62-year-old man surnamed Zhang, had shown no symptoms. \n Citing hospital sources, the news magazine Caixin also reported that a new case in Wuhan on Tuesday was a doctor who had been infected by an asymptomatic patient. \n China says asymptomatic patients will be added to the list of confirmed patients if they show symptoms at a later stage. \n But it remains unclear how many asymptomatic cases remain undiagnosed and therefore unquarantined. \n Some experts warn that undetected, asymptomatic patients could create fresh transmission routes once lockdowns are eased. \n \"It is especially concerning given that many countries have yet to implement sufficient levels of widespread community testing,\" said Mr Adam Kamradt-Scott, a public health specialist at the University of Sydney. \n It is also unclear how much they might infect others. \n \"We know that that is possible, but we do not believe that that's a major driver of transmission,\" said Dr Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organisation at a briefing early in March. \n New studies show that asymptomatic carriers could pose risks. One analysis of the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak showed that 33 of the 104 infected passengers remained asymptomatic even after an average of 10 days of observation at the Self-Defence Forces Central Hospital in Japan. \n While many appeared healthy throughout, a few other initially asymptomatic passengers quickly became seriously ill. \n Another study published on Monday, looking at cases in the south-western Chinese city of Chongqing, said 18 per cent of patients were asymptomatic. \n Another even found that people are more likely to transmit the disease when symptoms are at their mildest. \n The Yale School of Public Health said the existence of pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic patients meant that screening procedures at airports and other points of entry were insufficient to prevent the coronavirus passing from China to other countries. \n \"The real picture will only come to light when we have a serological test to find out who has been infected,\" said Dr Ian Henderson, director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at Queensland University. \n "}, {"content": "Oil prices rise more than 1%, on course for weekly gain.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.\nThe American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help.\n“It was heartbreaking to watch,” said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. “If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.”\nZhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.\nAs an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.\nNo other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.\nZhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to U.S. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.\nQuick left amid a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The U.S. CDC said it first learned of a “cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia” of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31.\nSince then, the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems in some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere.\nDuring a press briefing on Sunday shortly after this story was first published, President Donald Trump dismissed the Reuters report as similar to other stories regarding the CDC that he described as “100 percent wrong,” without addressing whether the role had been eliminated.\nU.S. CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield maintained the agency’s presence in China “is actually being augmented as we speak,” without elaborating.\nIn a statement to Reuters before the report was published, the CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington’s ability to get information and “had absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.”\nThe agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser “started well before last summer and was due to China’s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.”\nThe CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as “mentors” to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors’ specific role or expertise.\nThe CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.\nAsked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country “has adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.”\nOne disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government’s suppression of information.\n“In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn’t have made a big difference,” Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University. “The problem was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn’t.”\nAlex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield’s conversations with “Chinese colleagues.”\nRedfield learned that “this looks to be a novel coronavirus” from Dr. Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Dr. Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,” the official said.\nHHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.\nZhu and other sources said U.S. leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20.\nAfter the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.\nAzar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.\n“Dr. Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,” Azar said. “We made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? What is the severity? What is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?”\nDays later, the World Health Organization secured permission to send a team that included two U.S. experts. The team visited between Feb. 16th and 24th. By then, China had reported more than 75,000 cases.\nOn Feb. 25, the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak at home, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of medical professionals and media.\nRelations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as Trump has labeled the coronavirus the “Chinese virus” - a description the Chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three U.S. news organizations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China.\nThe decision to eliminate Quick’s job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of U.S. staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.\n“We had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,” the same expert said.\nThe CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move. “It was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability” it said.\nThe U.S. CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. COVID-19 is not influenza, though it can cause severe respiratory illness.\nThe CDC team, aside from Quick, was housed at U.S. Embassy facilities. No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China’s disease control agency, the sources said.\nChina in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people.\nNevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.\nThomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the U.S. resident adviser had still been in China, “it is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.”\nDr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among U.S health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training program.\nYet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.\n“We go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,” Conway said.\nIn 2007, Dr. Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist  and one of the longest serving U.S. officials in the adviser’s position, received China’s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.\nBut since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China’s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.\n“The message from the administration was, ‘Don’t work with China, they’re our rival,’” Frieden said.\nTrump’s re-election campaign sent out a statement Sunday evening dismissing controversy about the CDC’S cut as a matter of politics.\n“Democrats are eager to politicize the coronavirus crisis and weaponize it against President Trump, the statement said. “In so doing, they’re siding with the Chinese and providing cover for Beijing’s cover-up.”\n"}, {"content": "China's Wuhan, where the coronavirus emerged, begins to lift its lockdown. WUHAN, China (Reuters) - The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak first emerged, began lifting a two-month lockdown on Saturday by restarting some metro services and reopening borders, allowing some semblance of normality to return and families to reunite.\nAfter being cut-off from the rest of the country for two months, the reopening of Wuhan, where the epidemic first erupted in late December, marks a turning point in China’s fight against the virus, though the contagion has since spread to over 200 countries.\nAmong those on the first high-speed trains allowed into the city on Saturday morning was Guo Liangkai, a 19-year-old student whose one-month work stint in Shanghai stretched to three months due to the clamp down on movement.\n“It makes me very happy that I can see my family,” Guo told Reuters after being greeted by his mother at the main station.\n“We wanted to hug but now is a special period so we can’t hug or take any actions like these.”\nAuthorities took draconian measures to stop people from entering or leaving the industrial city of 11 million people in central China. Families were confined to their homes. Bus and taxi services were shut, and only essential stores were allowed to remain open.\n“I think the resumption of work represents a kind of hope. It at least shows that China is victorious,” said Zhang Yulun, 35, returning to Wuhan for work.\nChina’s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. Mainland China now has 81,394 cases, with the death toll rising by three to 3,295, the commission said.\nWuhan accounts for about 60% of China’s coronavirus cases, but they have fallen sharply in recent weeks, a sign that the measures are working. The last confirmed locally transmitted case of the virus in Wuhan was on Monday.\nWith the United States, Italy and Spain and other countries now battling soaring infections, China is focusing on the risk posed by imported cases - most of them Chinese returning home.\nEffective Saturday, China suspended the entry of foreign nationals with valid Chinese visas and residence permits.\nBut even with the decline in cases and loosening of restrictions, Wuhan authorities were taking few chances.\nStaff, some in full-body protective gear, and volunteers bustled around the railway station in the morning, setting out hand disinfectant and putting up signs reminding travelers they need a mobile-phone based health code to take public transport.\nA worker walked through one metro train carrying a signboard reading: “Wear a mask for the entire journey, people should not gather and when you disembark please scan the health code.”\n“Everyone is taking the right precautions. So, there shouldn’t be a problem,” Yuan Hai, 30, a passenger on a reopened metro line said when asked about the risks. “But you have to be careful.”\nThe existence of an unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that lifting the restrictions may release thousands of people who could still be spreading the virus that causes COVID-19, without knowing they are sick.\nLife in Wuhan remains far from normal. The vast majority of shops are shut while bright yellow roadblocks remain. Wuhan will not let people leave the city until April 8.\nSome people at the railway station, such as a woman who only gave her surname as Zhang, said they were there to see if there was any chance people could leave earlier.\nHer grandson came to visit her for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday in January and has been separated from his parents in the southern city of Shenzhen ever since. With schools there possibly reopening, she hopes he can get back soon.\n“He was supposed to leave on the fifth day (of the holiday) but has now been here for a few months,” she said.\n"}, {"content": "La OMS descarta declarar el coronavirus como emergencia internacional.

Tomemos, por ejemplo, la epidemia de gripe a (porcina) nacida en México en abril de 2009. De una semana para otra, la atención del país (y del mundo entero) se volcó sobre cuatro caracteres: H1N1. Una sensación de emergencia se contagió rápidamente, como movida por impulsos eléctricos, reflejándose por ejemplo en las correspondientes búsquedas de Google. Pero la evolución propia de la epidemia fue sustancialmente más gradual.\nLo que es más: poco a poco, los equipos científicos fueron destilando el impacto real agregado del virus, imponiendo en paralelo las medidas de contención y respuesta necesarias. Al final, se trató de una enfermedad contagiosa, sí, y sorprendentemente peligrosa para los más jóvenes (cuando la gripe suele afectar sobre todo a los mayores de 65). Pero no supuso la catástrofe en mortalidad que nuestras mentes querían dramatizar: según una estimación del Centro de Control de Enfermedades de los EEUU, el H1N1 acabó con la vida de aproximadamente las mismas personas que la gripe de temporada, manteniéndose por debajo de otras pandemias en el pasado.\nNuestro cerebro, sin embargo, sigue empeñado en buscar dramas así sea en los números aparentemente fríos. Una de estas cifras, que ha captado la atención de la audiencia en las redes sociales sobre el nCoV, es el conocido como R0: la media de personas que se contagiarán desde otra ya infectada por una enfermedad. Apenas llevábamos unas semanas de epidemia cuando varios epidemiólogos sacaron sus estimaciones. Algunos se agarraron a las cifras más altas para, una vez más, hacer sonar la alarma con mensajes del estilo “cada afectado por coronavirus contagiará a tres personas”. Pero la verdad es que dichas estimaciones eran considerablemente variables. Siempre lo son: incluso con enfermedades bien conocidas, el valor del R0 cambia enormemente según el estudio.\nEs apenas normal: al fin y al cabo, una enfermedad puede comportarse de manera muy distinta según el contexto social en que se desarrolle. No será lo mismo un brote vírico en un lugar sin condiciones higiénicas y de alta densidad poblacional, que en una zona rural poco habitada. Es por ello que incluso las más contagiosas, como el sarampión, ofrecen rangos enormemente amplios de contagio. Además, no olvidemos que las medias pueden ser engañosas: si resulta que el valor de contagio del nCoV en China es de 2, esta cifra es tan compatible con la idea de mil infectados transmitiéndole el virus a dos personas cada uno, como el escenario extremo de diez “super-contagiadores” que afectan a cincuenta personas más cada uno (porque su trabajo les pone en contacto con mucha gente, porque aún no había aislamiento, o por otras razones) y otros novecientos noventa que contagian a menos de una persona per capita. Mientras el primer escenario garantizaría un contagio exponencial, en el segundo el control del virus sería mucho más sencillo una vez uno identifica las condiciones que favorecen la transmisión masiva. Entre ambos extremos hay todo un mundo de posibilidades que no conocemos, y que condicionará cuándo y cómo llegará el nCoV a Latinoamérica.\nEn realidad, lo que nos enseñan estos números es que la incertidumbre es un aspecto ineludible cuando hablamos de epidemias. El drama es, de hecho, una manera de reducirla: si tenemos un enemigo claramente identificable, el miedo se convierte en certeza. Pero este mismo sesgo es el que nos hace menospreciar o ignorar aquellos riesgos a los que ya nos hemos acostumbrado. Incluso cuando sufren un repunte preocupante.\nHablemos, por ejemplo, del mentado sarampión. En 2016 hubo menos de cien casos en el continente americano. Dos años después la cifra se había multiplicado por ciento sesenta: unos 16.000, contabilizados por la OMS, la mayoría localizados en Brasil. En 2019 Sao Paulo registró la primera muerte por esta enfermedad en dos décadas. La falta de cobertura de vacunación completa y eficaz fue la principal causa.\nLa malaria, contagiada a través de mosquitos en ciertas zonas tropicales, es otro caso de retorno de un adversario que nunca se fue del todo. Pero aquí el peso del repunte corresponde a Venezuela, que acaparó más de la mitad del total de los casos en 2017.\nCuriosamente, aunque ambas enfermedades han llamado desproporcionadamente la atención en los respectivos países durante la última mitad de 2019, tanto en Brasil como en Venezuela la mirada (medida por búsquedas de Google) giró rápidamente al coronavirus a principios de 2020, confirmando que nada supera a una buena, nueva historia de miedo e incertidumbre.\nAsí, pese a que nuestra atención siga lógicas distintas, mientras ciertas enfermedades están muy disminuidas o casi desaparecidas en la región (el cólera es un buen ejemplo de éxito), otras se mantienen con cifras similares (tuberculosis: en torno a 280.000 casos en todo el continente americano año tras año durante todo el siglo XXI) o, como las anteriormente referenciadas, incluso recuperan terreno perdido. A la hora de buscar causas, no hay respuestas sencillas. Las enfermedades transmitidas por mosquitos ofrecen un buen ejemplo. Varios médicos venezolanos sobre el terreno se han quejado de la ausencia de fumigaciones encabezadas por el estado que otrora servían para diezmar la malaria. Pero la fumigación no lo es todo: como se preguntaba en su editorial de marzo de 2016 la revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud de Colombia, del Zika (otro virus contagiado por picaduras) en Colombia y Brasil, ¿realmente cómo de efectivo es fumigar en lugares que no reúnen las condiciones de salubridad (acueducto, recolección de basuras) mínimas? El director del Instituto de Salud y Ambiente de la Universidad del Bosque, Víctor Olano, apuntaba en un ejemplar posterior de la misma publicación la necesidad de garantizar estas coberturas mínimas en las áreas rurales como primera línea de fuego contra otra enfermedad aún presente en el continente: la fiebre amarilla.\nUna reflexión similar podremos hacer en su día con el nCoV: aunque es probable que toda la atención mediática se centre en el diseño de nuevos fármacos, las medidas de control básico de proliferación (identificación temprana de casos con su correspondiente aislamiento) y el mantenimiento de sistemas inmunológicos sanos son las estrategias más eficaces, pero menos espectaculares. Igualmente, la mejor manera de prevenir que este tipo de epidemias florezcan es la implementación de protocolos higiénicos en el tratamiento de animales por parte de humanos, algo en lo que los poderes públicos también tienen mucho que decir y hacer.\nLa guerra contra las epidemias no es, en definitiva, una cuestión de una sola batalla dramática por el destino de la humanidad. Tampoco lo será con el nCoV, como no lo fue con el H1N1 (que, aunque disminuido, sigue entre nosotros).\nLa moraleja es que, como decía el médico divulgador sueco Hans Rosling, debemos domar nuestra sed de drama y reenfocar atención, esfuerzos, dedicación hacia aquello que puede realmente tener un impacto positivo. En el caso de las enfermedades infecciosas, las vacunas, los protocolos e infraestructuras de salubridad, la investigación y la existencia de mecanismos de respuesta a nivel internacional son nuestros mejores aliados. Mientras los dos primeros puntos son los que nos ayudarán a combatir las enfermedades ya conocidas, investigación y capacidades supra-estatales son particularmente cruciales cuando estamos ante una enfermedad nueva. Consciente de ello, la Organización Mundial de la Salud acordó un marco de referencia regulatorio internacional en 2005 para asegurar el compromiso con unos estándares comunes en la región, y en el mundo entero. Año a año, la propia OMS mide el grado de implementación de las regulaciones en cada país.\nAunque hay diferencias obvias en la región, la concordancia es considerable. Existen algunos puntos preocupantes en lo que respecta a preparación, y ciertos países se encuentran llamativamente por detrás del resto. Además, es importante remarcar que estas cifras de la OMS no miden la calidad ni el estado efectivo de los sistemas sanitarios sobre el terreno. Algo en lo que, por ejemplo, Venezuela puntuaría muy por debajo del resto dado el deterioro sufrido por sus instalaciones con la crisis de los últimos años. Lo único que indican estos datos es que, sobre el papel, el continente dispone de muchas de las herramientas de gobernanza necesarias para enfrentar una nueva epidemia. Ahora bien, para saber cuál será su traducción exacta a la realidad sólo podemos esperar.\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 3-China's Wuhan closes coronavirus hospital as officials hail drop in new cases. BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The Chinese city at the center of the coronavirus epidemic has closed the first of 16 specially built hospitals, hurriedly put up to treat people with the virus, after it discharged its last recovered patients, state broadcaster CCTV said on Monday.\nNews of the closure coincided with a sharp fall in new cases in Hubei province and its capital of Wuhan but China remained on alert for people returning home with the virus from other countries where it has spread.\n“The rapid rising trend of virus cases in Wuhan has been controlled,” Mi Feng, a spokesman for China’s National Health Commission told a briefing.\n“Outbreaks in Hubei outside of Wuhan are curbed and provinces outside of Hubei are showing a positive trend.”\nThe virus emerged in Wuhan late last year and has since infected more than 86,500 people, the majority in China, with most in Hubei.\nOutside China, it has in recent days spread rapidly, now to 53 countries, with more than 6,500 cases and more than 100 deaths. In all, the illness has killed nearly 3,000 people.\nHubei on Sunday reported 196 new infections, the first time since January it has reported fewer than 200 in a day, the National Health Commission said on Monday.\nAfter what some critics said was an initially hesitant response to the new virus, China imposed sweeping restrictions to try to stop it, including widespread suspensions of transport and extending a Lunar New Year holiday across the country.\nMi said authorities would transition from “overall containment to targeted containment” measures, with a focus on containment within communities, and medical treatment.\nWuhan’s Communist Party chief Chen Yixin hailed the government’s virus prevention efforts and said he expected the number of new cases to soon drop below 100 a day, the Communist Party’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission said.\n“The outbreak situation is under strong control,” Chen said of the situation in the city.\nMainland China had a total of 202 new confirmed cases on Sunday, the lowest since Jan. 22. All but six were in Hubei.\nThe death toll from the outbreak in mainland China reached 2,912 as of the end of Sunday, up by 42 from the previous day.\nHubei accounted for all of the 42 new deaths, with 32 of them in Wuhan.\nWith numbers of new infections falling, Wuhan closed its first specially built hospital after it discharged the last batch of 34 recovered patients, CCTV reported.\nWuhan opened 16 temporary hospitals, adding 13,000 beds and treating 12,000 people in response to the outbreak.\nEighteen provinces across China have lowered their coronavirus emergency response level in the past week, the latest being Zhejiang province.\nThere are also growing signs of the world’s second-biggest economy getting back to business after a crippling February that saw factory activity contract sharply.\nThe economy and information technology bureau in the commercial hub of Shanghai said that 66% of its businesses had resumed operations, though only 53% of small enterprises were back to work, underscoring lingering difficulties for private businesses.\nChinese shares soared on hopes the government would roll out more measures to support the economy. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC adding 3.2% on Monday, its best day since March 2019.\nBut as the country slowly returns to normal, President Xi Jinping has warned that China needed to take a long-term view of the outbreak and plug loopholes in emergency response mechanisms.\nThe case of an infected inmate released from a Wuhan prison, who then traveled to Beijing, had in particular prompted sharp criticism over loopholes.\nOn Monday, a government investigation team sent to Wuhan called the former inmate’s return to Beijing a “serious incident caused by dereliction of duty”, CCTV reported.\nIn an illustration of the dangers of what has evolved into a global epidemic, Beijing reported two new coronavirus cases in Chinese nationals who recently returned from Iran, where the outbreak has grown quickly.\nThe Global Times newspaper also reported on Monday an imported case, from someone returning from Italy, which has become Europe’s coronavirus hot spot.\n"}, {"content": "El coronavirus también amenaza a la economía en China. La inactividad y la incertidumbre dan estos días a China un extraño aire sonámbulo. Apenas circulan vehículos o pasea gente por las calles. Más de 46 millones de personas están bloqueadas por la cuarentena. Muchos transportes, suspendidos. Las clases en los centros de enseñanza, canceladas hasta nueva orden. Los comercios, cerrados. El coronavirus de Wuhan, que ya ha matado a 170 personas e infectado a más de 7.800, amenaza con dejar, al menos a corto plazo, profundos efectos en la economía del país, que ya afrontaba su menor crecimiento en décadas, el 6,1%.\nSegún ha apuntado el economista Zhang Ming, de la Academia China de Ciencias Sociales —el principal think tank estatal chino—, en declaraciones que recoge la revista Caijing, el crecimiento del PIB en el primer trimestre de este año podría reducirse en un punto porcentual y situarse en el 5% o incluso menos, debido al parón a causa del virus.\nEstos días, las ciudades chinas parecen enormes desiertos. Cines, museos, y atracciones turísticas han cancelado sus operaciones. La mayoría de las tiendas continúan cerradas; las que han abierto —con los dependientes bien cubiertos por una mascarilla—, apenas registran actividad, excepto las que venden comestibles. Muchos restaurantes no se han molestado en reabrir pese a que, en condiciones normales, estos serían días de hacer caja: ahora el público evita los lugares concurridos. En el núcleo industrial de Suzhou, las fábricas tienen prohibido reabrir hasta el 8 de febrero. En Shanghái, las empresas no retomarán su actividad al menos hasta el 9.\nJunto al consumo, el sector más afectado por las medidas de contención ha sido el transporte. Al bloqueo de buena parte de Hubei, la provincia donde se encuentra Wuhan —el foco de la infección—, se suma la recomendación de evitar los desplazamientos en la medida de lo posible. Los aeropuertos, en la que debía ser su época de mayor actividad del año, están semivacíos. Se han paralizado rutas de autobús de larga distancia y de tren de alta velocidad. Los viajes al exterior con touroperadores se han suspendido. Según los datos oficiales del Gobierno, el transporte ha caído con respecto a las fechas de Año Nuevo lunar de 2019 en un 28,8%. En el sector ferroviario, el descenso llega al 41,5%. En el aéreo, el 41,6%.\nLa situación no podía llegar en peor momento. El Año Nuevo chino es, como las Navidades o el Black Friday en Occidente, el momento de mayor gasto en el consumo, un sector de cada vez más peso en el PIB chino. Una demanda débil y los sobresaltos causados por la guerra comercial entre Estados Unidos y China habían dejado el crecimiento económico en el 6,1%, su nivel más bajo en tres décadas.\n“El impacto del coronavirus en la economía china puede ser mucho más importante que el que tuvo el SARS”, explica Alicia García-Herrero, economista jefe para Asia del banco de inversión Natixis. García-Herrero alude al síndrome que, provocado también por un coronavirus de la misma familia que el de Wuhan, surgió en 2003 en un mercado de Cantón (sur de China) para dejar casi 800 víctimas mortales en todo el mundo.\nEntonces, aquella epidemia restó un punto porcentual al crecimiento chino durante el segundo trimestre del año, que se situó en el 9,1%. Las ventas al por menor cayeron a la mitad. Aunque el golpe a la economía fue solo temporal, y en trimestres posteriores el crecimiento recuperó sus niveles previos por encima del 10%.\nPero ahora, apunta García-Herrero, “China depende mucho más del consumo de lo que dependía en 2003, y el consumo se va a desacelerar sin ninguna duda”. A los bienes de lujo y duraderos hay que sumarles el sector de la hostelería. “Son muchos sectores que se van a ver afectados, y que son mucho más importantes para el crecimiento chino de lo que eran en 2003, cuando la demanda externa era la clave”, señala.\n“En China durante 2019, el consumo contribuyó cerca de 3,5 puntos porcentuales al crecimiento real total de un 6,1% del PIB. Un cálculo rápido apunta a que si el gasto en esos servicios cayera en un 10%, el crecimiento total del PIB caería en cerca de 1,2 puntos porcentuales”, apunta la consultora S&P Global Ratings en una nota.\nLos primeros indicios no son alentadores. En su reapertura tras las vacaciones, las acciones en la Bolsa de Hong Kong han retrocedido un 2,4%. Debido al cierre de las principales cadenas y la suspensión de los grandes estrenos, en Año Nuevo, cuando se suelen romper récords de taquilla, la recaudación en los cines fue de solo 1,81 millones de yuanes, o unos 250.000 euros, según la compañía de venta de entradas Maoyan. Es una caída del 99% con respecto al año anterior.\n“Es una certeza que el brote de coronavirus tendrá un impacto en el crecimiento económico de este trimestre”, considera Mark Williams, de Capital Economics, en una nota. En comparación con el SARS, “mientras esta vez la respuesta oficial más transparente y activa puede demostrarse más efectiva en la contención del virus, también puede hacer mayor el perjuicio económico inicial”.\nBuena parte de estos daños podrían corresponder al amplio sector de la economía sumergida china, el representado por los migrantes a zonas urbanas. De regreso en el campo para pasar las festividades con sus familiares, muchos se han visto sorprendidos por la cuarentena o han visto alterados sus planes de viaje. El prolongado parón de sus puestos de trabajo puede dejarles sin ingresos mientras dure.\n“Después del SARS, China adoptó una política fiscal expansiva, incluidos recortes de impuestos, para ayudar a la recuperación de los sectores más afectados”, apunta Tianlei Huang, del Instituto Internacional de Economía Peterson (PIIE). “Esta vez, China cuenta con grandes déficit fiscales y, por tanto, tiene menos espacio para aplicar estímulos fiscales que entonces. En la política monetaria, el banco central puede aumentar un apoyo de liquidez, pero no habrá un estímulo impulsado por el crédito”.\nLa clave, apuntan los analistas, estará en la rapidez con la que se resuelva la crisis. “Dependiendo de cómo se reduzca la crisis, y especialmente cómo lo gestione el Gobierno chino —no en poca medida lo transparente que sea—, el coste podría agravar la disminución del crecimiento chino”, apunta Huang.\n"}, {"content": "Francia amplia a tres los casos del virus de Wuhan, los primeros en Europa. El virus de Wuhan ya ha llegado a Europa. Concretamente a Francia, donde se han confirmado tres casos, dos en París y otro en Burdeos, según ha comunicado este viernes el Ministerio de Salud. El anuncio coincide con la investigación que está realizando España, que estudia si una mujer en el País Vasco que volvió de China recientemente está infectada por el coronavirus, ya que presenta sintomatología ligada a esta enfermedad. Este mismo viernes el Ministerio de Sanidad español descartó otros dos posibles contagios y Estados Unidos detectó la existencia de un segundo afectado por la enfermedad, que ya ha causado 41 muertos en China, según las últimas cifras actualizadas por Bloomberg, y mantiene en cuarentena a 41 millones de personas en ese país.\nAl anunciar a primera hora de la noche los dos primeros casos, la ministra francesa de Salud, Agnès Buzyn, advertía de que todo apunta a que estos primeros casos europeos no serán los únicos. Poco después, su oficina confirmaba el tercer caso, relacionado con uno de los dos primeros detectados. “Es probable que haya otras” personas infectadas en territorio europeo, adelantó Buzyn, para quien el virus “es un fuego que hay que delimitar”.\nEn todos los casos franceses se trata de personas que han estado en China y, al menos de una de ellas, se tiene constancia de que estuvo en la ciudad de Wuhan. Se trata del paciente ingresado en Burdeos, un ciudadano chino de 48 años que acudió el jueves 23 a un centro médico para “consultar por los síntomas” que presentaba tras su regreso un día antes de China, donde “pasó por la ciudad de Wuhan” por “motivos profesionales”, explicó Buzyn en rueda de prensa. El afectado se encuentra ingresado desde la víspera en Burdeos “en una habitación aislada” y “se encuentra bien”, aunque antes de confirmarse su enfermedad “estuvo en contacto con una decena de personas desde su regreso a Francia”. Las autoridades sanitarias van a “contactar” a dichas personas, para constatar su estado de salud, aseveró.\nMenos se sabe de los dos casos parisinos. Del primero anunciado, Buzyn reveló que se encuentra ingresado en el hospital Bichat de la capital. “Sabemos que esta persona viajó a China, pero no sabemos si estuvo en Wuhan”, agregó la ministra, médico de profesión. En un comunicado al filo de la media noche, su ministerio indicó que se había confirmado otro caso que estaba siendo investigado, y que está relacionado con uno de los primeros pacientes. El tercer afectado, de quien no se han dado datos más allá de que también estuvo en China, también está ingresado en París. \"Todas las medidas de aislamiento e higiene han sido tomadas\", aseguró el Ministerio de Salud.\nBuzyn ha insistido en que \"es posible\" que se localicen nuevos afectados en Francia, aunque ha asegurado que se está haciendo todo lo posible para \"contener\" la propagación del virus por el país. La ministra ha pedido a los viajeros que regresen de China que, ante la menor señal de malestar, no acudan a los servicios de urgencia hospitalaria sino que contacten antes telefónicamente con las autoridades sanitarias, \"para evitar todo contagio potencial\".\nMientras, en España, la Dirección de Salud Pública y Adicciones del Departamento de Salud del Gobierno Vasco ha sido notificada esta tarde de un caso sospechoso de neumonía asociada al coronavirus de origen chino. Se trata de una mujer que recientemente ha vuelto de la provincia de Wuhan en China y presenta patologías ligadas a esta enfermedad. La afectada está ingresada en aislamiento en el Hospital Universitario de Cruces, según Europa Press. El Departamento vasco de Salud ha informado de que la muestra de la analítica ya ha sido enviada al Centro Nacional de Microbiología de Majadahonda, laboratorio de referencia para realizar este análisis específico y está previsto contar con el resultado en las próximas 24-48 horas.\nAdemás, otros dos casos que se estudiaban en España como sospechosos por el coronavirus de Wuhan han dado negativo. Así lo ha notificado el Ministerio de Sanidad en la tarde del viernes después de que el director del Centro de Coordinación y Emergencias Sanitarias del Ministerio de Sanidad, Fernando Simón, informara ese mismo día de que dos personas estaban siendo estudiadas por posible contagio, ya que ambas llegaron recientemente a España procedentes de la ciudad china origen de la infección con algunos síntomas.\nLas autoridades sanitarias de Estados Unidos han confirmado este viernes un segundo caso en el país del agresivo coronavirus. Al igual que el primer caso, detectado durante el pasado fin de semana en Seattle, se trata de una persona que viajó recientemente a la ciudad de Wuhan, epicentro de la crisis sanitaria.\nHasta el momento, el virus ha causado 41 muertes, todas en China, todas menos dos en la región de Wuhan. Más de 1.100 han sido contaminadas en ese país, de las cuales casi dos centenares están en un estado grave. Las autoridades también están vigilando 1.072 casos sospechosos. Hasta el momento, el virus ha llegado a Hong Kong, Singapur, Corea del Sur, Nepal, Taiwan, Macao, Estados Unidos, Francia y Japón.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Lieferengpässe in Industrie und Handel. \nDie Folgen der Coronavirus-Epidemie in China werden in den nächsten Wochen verstärkt Deutschlands Industrie und Handel treffen.\nDa viele chinesische Fabriken über Wochen stillstanden und auch derzeit nur eingeschränkt arbeiten, fehlen Vorprodukte, Teile oder komplette Erzeugnisse, die hierzulande verarbeitet beziehungsweise verkauft werden. Betroffen ist unter anderem die Elektronikbranche. Gestört sind nicht nur Importe, sondern auch Lieferungen nach China.\nEigentlich wollten die EU-Handelsminister am Donnerstag über das Thema beraten, doch das Treffen ist abgesagt. Die durchschnittliche Transportdauer von China nach Europa auf dem Seeweg beläuft sich auf sechs Wochen, über Land per Güterzug auf der Neuen Seidenstraße sind es etwa drei Wochen. Daher schlagen die Auswirkungen des chinesischen Coronastillstands nun mit Verzögerung auf Produktion und Handel in Europa durch.\nMit Importen von 52 Milliarden Euro sei China der „mit Abstand größte ausländische Lieferant für den deutschen Elektromarkt“, sagt Andreas Gontermann, der Chefvolkswirt des Zentralverbands Elektrotechnik- und Elektronikindustrie (ZVEI). „Die Lieferschwierigkeiten betreffen die Branche nicht flächendeckend“, sagt er. „Etliche Unternehmen berichten aber über Störungen in den Liefer- und Produktionsketten.“\nGontermann beziffert das Volumen der aus China nach Deutschland gelieferten Vorleistungsprodukte auf einen Wert von 10 Milliarden Euro im Jahr. „Wie viel davon liefergefährdet ist, lässt sich schwer abschätzen“, sagt Gontermann. Und damit ist es noch nicht getan: „Hinzu kommt, dass Vorleistungen aus anderen Ländern ebenfalls chinesische Vorleistungen enthalten können“, erklärt er. So laufen auch die japanische und die südkoreanische Wirtschaft derzeit nur gebremst, beide Länder sind sehr wichtig für die Elektronikbranche.\nAuch die Verbraucher werden aller Voraussicht nach die Auswirkungen in den Elektromärkten spüren. „Aktuell lassen sich noch keine Lieferengpässe durch die Restriktionen des Coronavirus feststellen, derzeit rechnen wir für April mit ersten möglichen Lieferengpässen und steigenden Wareneinstandspreisen“, sagt Alexander Maier, Senior Vice President bei Ingram Micro, einem im Münchner Vorort Aschheim ansässigen Großhändler für Elektro- und Elektronikerzeugnisse. „Wir arbeiten aktuell an Strategien, um auf diese Auswirkungen schnell reagieren zu können und unseren Kunden auch weiterhin die bestmögliche Warenverfügbarkeit zu bieten.“\nBesorgt ist auch die Autoindustrie. \"Derzeit läuft die Produktion an allen Standorten\", sagt eine Audi-Sprecherin in Ingolstadt. \"Es ist natürlich nicht abzusehen, wie sich die Lage mittelfristig – insbesondere mit Blick auf die Lieferkette – entwickeln wird. Eventuell drohende Engpässe versuchen wir durch gezielte Maßnahmen abzufedern.\"\nAudi sitzt in Bayern, wo die Unternehmen besonders abhängig vom Ausland sind und mehr als die Hälfte ihrer Umsätze außerhalb der deutschen Grenzen erwirtschaften. „Lieferketten zwischen China und Bayern sind unterbrochen und werden aus heutiger Sicht in den kommenden Wochen noch stärker unterbrochen, wenn zum Beispiel Vorkrisenprodukte verarbeitet sind und keine weiteren nachkommen“, sagt Bertram Brossardt, der Hauptgeschäftsführer der Vereinigung der bayerischen Wirtschaft (vbw).\nDie wichtigsten Importgüter aus China für die bayerische Wirtschaft sind Datenverarbeitungsgeräte, elektronische und optische Erzeugnisse, elektrische Ausrüstungen und Maschinen. „Wir erwarten eine Unterbrechung der Lieferketten in etwa proportional zum Volumen der einzelnen Warengruppen“, sagt Brossardt. Das dürfte analog für UNternehmen im Rest der Republik gelten, die aus China beliefert werden.\nFür Außenstehende nicht abzuschätzen sind die Auswirkungen auf die Versorgung mit Medikamenten. Nach Angaben des Bundesinstituts für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte in Bonn gibt es derzeit keine Coronavirus-bedingten Engpässe. Doch hat Indien - wo viele Nachahmermedikamente für den Weltmarkt hergestellt werden - vergangene Woche die Ausfuhr 26 gängiger Wirkstoffe begrenzt, darunter Paracetamol und mehrere Antibiotika.\nEin bedeutender Großhändler für Medikamente ist die in Mannheim ansässige Phoenix Pharmahandel - und das Unternehmen mauert: „Das Thema Ihrer Anfrage können wir nicht bewerten“, teilt ein Sprecher mit. Der Pharmaverband Progenerika erklärt, man gehe nicht davon aus, „dass es bis zum Sommer 2020 aufgrund von Corona zu Engpässen in der Versorgung in Deutschland kommt“. Was dann kommt? „Derzeit noch nicht abzusehen.“ (dpa)\n"}, {"content": "Der Informant. Er ist jetzt der bekannteste Virologe Deutschlands. 2003 hat er das Sars-Virus entschlüsselt, nun den ersten Nachweistest für das neue Coronavirus aus Wuhan entwickelt. Seither fragt alle Welt um seinen Rat. Es müsste eigentlich unmöglich sein, an Christian Drosten heranzukommen.\nDoch der Direktor des Instituts für Virologie an der Berliner Charité hält sich radikal an eine Strategie, die er schon während der Sars-Epidemie zu seinem Credo gemacht hat: Alle Informationen müssen raus, alles muss an die Öffentlichkeit. Nur so lässt sich ein Virus in Schach halten. Also hastet Christian Drosten – etwas spät ist er dran, gerade war er im Auswärtigen Amt – am vergangenen Montag in sein Büro, sieht noch schnell ein paar E-Mails durch, nimmt an einem runden Naturholztisch Platz, lehnt sich zurück und ist fokussiert.\nIst die Lage angesichts des technischen Fortschritts heute im Vergleich nicht viel besser als während der Sars-Epidemie? \"Ich weiß nicht\", sagt Drosten. Auf der einen Seite habe man mit vielen Genomanalysen sehr schnell herausfinden können, dass das Virus noch nicht lange unter Menschen zirkuliere. \"Das ist gut, um die Epidemie einzuschätzen.\" Auf der anderen Seite habe sich die Mobilität der chinesischen Gesellschaft drastisch verändert. \"Ich kann mir gut vorstellen, dass sich die schnelle Verbreitung des jetzigen Virus allein daraus erklärt.\"\nDer 47-jährige Mediziner beschäftigt sich schon sein ganzes Berufsleben mit Coronaviren. Als der Sars-Erreger (Schweres Akutes Respiratorisches Syndrom) Ende 2002 seinen Seuchenzug antrat, wusste zunächst niemand, um was für einen Keim es sich handelte. Damals arbeitete Christian Drosten am Bernhard-Nocht-Institut für Tropenmedizin in Hamburg und entwickelte Diagnostiktests für Infektionskrankheiten. Es gelang dem Nachwuchswissenschaftler, den Erreger von Sars zu identifizieren, ein Coronavirus, das dem aktuellen 2019-nCoV in China ähnelt.\nMit einem Kollegen konnte er damals in kürzester Zeit einen Nachweistest präsentieren. Zwei Jahre später erhielt er dafür das Bundesverdienstkreuz. Mit nur 35 Jahren wechselte Drosten dann als Leiter zum Institut für Virologie am Universitätsklinikum Bonn, zehn Jahre später ging er an die Charité.\nDort verfolgt der Virologe mit seinem Team jetzt seit Wochen jeden Winkelzug des neuen Coronavirus. Ohne es selbst im Labor gehabt zu haben, entwickelte er den Test dafür.\nDrosten behauptet nicht, er verstehe das Virus bereits. Wie alle Beteiligten muss er damit umgehen, dass sich die Datenlage stündlich ändert. Zuerst hieß es aus China, das Virus könne nicht von Mensch zu Mensch übertragen werden. Das war bald überholt. Dann hieß es, drastische Maßnahmen wie die Abriegelung ganzer Metropolen könnten das Virus in China eindämmen. Eine Fehlannahme.\nDas Bild des Coronavirus stellt sich langsamer scharf, als es die rasante Medienwelt verlangt. Deshalb formuliert Drosten an diesem Tag nur eine Arbeitshypothese: Das neuartige Coronavirus sei im Prinzip wie Sars. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt leitet er daraus ab, dass sich 2019-nCoV nur von Menschen mit Symptomen übertragen lässt.\nEinen Tag später heißt es, in Bayern habe eine Chinesin aus Schanghai das Virus an Mitarbeiter einer Firma übertragen, angeblich war sie asymptomatisch. Ein Alarmsignal: In symptomlosen Wirten kann das Virus unerkannt weit reisen und unterwegs viele Menschen infizieren. Im renommierten New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) erscheint ein Fachartikel über den bayerischen Fall, der Globale Gesundheitsnotstand wird von der WHO ausgerufen.\nEine Woche später ist klar, dass die Chinesin Rückenschmerzen hatte und ein fiebersenkendes Medikament nahm, weshalb die Infektion nicht auffiel – und dass die Autoren des Artikels mit der Chinesin nicht gesprochen hatten. Christian Drostens Name stand ebenfalls unter der Publikation. Das ist ihm unangenehm. Normalerweise überprüfe man in einer Gruppe von Autoren alle Fakten, sagt er, \"ich musste aber in diesem Fall den Autoren einfach vertrauen, die sich deutlich länger mit der Fallgeschichte der Patienten beschäftigt haben\". Als Bestätigungslabor habe er lediglich Daten zugeliefert, und für die stehe er gerade.\nAber ist nicht diese Panne ein Beispiel dafür, dass die voreilige Veröffentlichung von Daten schädlich ist?\nDoch Drosten bleibt bei seiner Forderung nach maximaler Transparenz. Dass die Patientin trotz Erkrankung noch Vorträge habe halten und Kollegen habe infizieren können, zeige, dass das Virus sich leichter verbreite als zunächst vermutet. Aber die Panne mit dem Artikel im NEJM belege eine andere bedenkliche Entwicklung. \"Die Journale machen heute aktiv Druck auf die Geschwindigkeit und wollen Sensation.\" Und das gelte auch für die hochrangigen Publikationen.\nDrosten veröffentlichte die allererste Arbeit über das neuartige Coronavirus in Eurosurveillance, der wissenschaftlichen Fachzeitschrift des Europäischen Zentrums für die Prävention und die Kontrolle von Krankheiten. \"Wir hätten das auch im NEJM publizieren können\", sagt er, \"haben das aber absichtlich nicht getan.\" Ihm war es wichtiger, dass alle Daten vollständig online verfügbar gemacht werden, damit sie jeder lesen kann.\nDas Einzige, was in einer Situation mit unzureichender Datenlage helfe, sei Transparenz, sagt Drosten. Denn nur wenn alle Informationen für die zuständigen Institutionen sofort verfügbar sind, ließen sich fehlerhafte Annahmen korrigieren und richtige Reaktionen einleiten. Als er diese rigorose Forderung während der Sars-Epidemie vertrat und frühzeitig Gendaten veröffentlichte, sei das \"total unüblich gewesen\", sagt er. Und heute ärgert er sich, dass manche Kollegen es immer noch nicht verstanden hätten und wichtige aktuelle Daten zurückhielten.\nDrosten kämpft auch hinter den Kulissen dafür, dass Wissenschaftsjournale neue Transparenzregeln einführen. Manuskripte sollten im Rahmen eines Seuchenausbruchs nur dann angenommen werden, wenn die Autoren die Daten zeitgleich auf einem öffentlich zugänglichen Pre-Print-Server ablegten. \"Das ist die einzige Regelung, die funktionieren kann, um endlich Transparenz in dieses System zu kriegen oder zu verhindern, dass das System den Fortschritt in der Bekämpfung von Epidemien verlangsamt.\"\nDer Virologe selbst praktiziert Transparenz auch in der Öffentlichkeit. Ein Kollege von ihm sagt, Drosten sei einer der wenigen Virologen, die Epidemien vollständig begreifen – sowohl die molekularbiologische Seite als auch die klinischen Aspekte und die Aufklärungsarbeit.\nAus der Sars-Krise habe er gelernt, sagt Drosten, dass neben der transparenten Verbreitung von wissenschaftlichen Daten die offene Kommunikation mit der Bevölkerung essenziell sei. \"Allein das Wissen um die Erkrankung hat damals in Hongkong schon ausgereicht, um die Patienten früher zum Arzt zu bringen.\" Wenn die Situation wie aktuell in Wuhan eskaliere, sei dementsprechend \"jede drastische Botschaft zweckdienlich\". Denn nur dann würden die Menschen ihr Verhalten ändern: Menschenansammlungen meiden und die notwendige soziale Distanz wahren.\nSein Wissen zu verbreiten, frisst nun einen großen Teil von Christian Drostens Zeit. Was für ihn nicht ganz unbedenklich ist. \"Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob mir das als Wissenschaftler so guttut\", sagt er, \"man muss aufpassen, dass man nicht zum Fernsehprofessor wird.\"\nEnde 2019 meldeten die chinesischen Behörden der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO eine Häufung von Lungenentzündungen unklarer Ursache in der zentralchinesischen Stadt Wuhan. Bereits eine Woche später identifizierten chinesische Forscher ein neuartiges Virus als Ursache der Krankheitsfälle. Es gehört zur Gruppe der Coronaviren. Wenige Tage darauf veröffentlichte eine Gruppe um den Virologen Christian Drosten von der Berliner Charité den ersten diagnostischen Test für das neue Virus, das Forscher provisorisch 2019-nCoV nennen. Mit dem Test kann das Virus im Labor nachgewiesen werden. Als Quelle des Erregers vermuten die chinesischen Behörden einen Lebensmittelmarkt in Wuhan, auf dem neben Fisch und Meeresfrüchten auch exotische Tiere wie Schlangen verkauft wurden. Der Markt wurde geschlossen und desinfiziert.\nSowohl die Atemwegserkrankungen Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) als auch Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) werden von Coronaviren verursacht, die ihren Ursprung in Tieren haben. Während der Sars-Pandemie infizierten sich in den Jahren 2002 und 2003 etwa 8.000 Menschen, mehr als 750 starben. Mit dem Mers-Virus haben sich seit seiner Entdeckung 2012 bis zum Jahresende 2019 etwa 2.500 Menschen angesteckt, jeder Dritte ist daran gestorben. Insgesamt gibt es aber mehrere Hundert Arten von Coronaviren. Viele von ihnen betreffen die Atemwege und können zum Beispiel Erkältungen verursachen.\nIn China sind inzwischen mehrere Tausend Personen erkrankt, einige von ihnen – die meisten wohl mit Vorerkrankungen – sind an einer Lungenentzündung infolge des Virus gestorben. Die ersten Infektionsfälle außerhalb Chinas wurden in Thailand, Japan und Südkorea bekannt. Es handelt sich um Reisende, die vorher in Wuhan gewesen waren. Am 21. Januar meldeten US-Behörden die erste Infektion bei einem Touristen, der aus Wuhan zurückkam, am 24. Januar wurden die ersten Fälle in Frankreich bekannt. Mittlerweile wurden auch erste Fälle in Deutschland bestätigt. Typische Zeichen einer Infektion sind Fieber, Husten und Atembeschwerden. Das Virus kann eine Lungenentzündung verursachen, die tödlich enden kann. Da es sich um eine virale Krankheit handelt, helfen Antibiotika nicht.\nInzwischen ist klar, dass das Virus von Mensch zu Mensch übertragen werden kann. Chinesische Behörden haben mehrere solcher Übertragungen bestätigt, nachdem auch etwa ein Dutzend Fälle bei medizinischem Personal bekannt wurden. Medizinerinnen und Mediziner gehen davon aus, dass das Virus vor allem über Tröpfcheninfektion übertragen wird. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation rechnet, wie sie am 24. Januar mitteilte, momentan damit, dass ein Infizierter im Schnitt 1,4 bis 2,5 andere Menschen ansteckt. Bewahrheiten sich diese Zahlen, ist das Virus weniger ansteckend als Sars und auch die Virusgrippe. Die WHO empfiehlt generelle Hygieneregeln zu beachten: Man solle sich häufig die Hände waschen und engen Kontakt zu Personen mit Atemwegserkrankungen und wilden Tieren meiden.\nDas lässt sich noch nicht mit Sicherheit sagen. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation teilte am 28. Januar mit, dass ungefähr ein Fünftel der gemeldeten Fälle durch das Virus schwer krank werde, im Zweifelsfall also intensivmedizinisch behandelt werden muss. Berichten zufolge handelte es sich bei den ersten Todesopfern um Patienten, die teils schwere Vorerkrankungen hatten. Auch bei anderen Infektionskrankheiten sind Menschen mit Vorerkrankungen besonders gefährdet – etwa bei der Grippe. Coronaviren sind dafür bekannt, dass sie mutieren, also ihr Erbgut verändern können. Das kann dazu führen, dass sie im Laufe eines Ausbruchs gefährlicher für Menschen werden – aber auch zum genauen Gegenteil. Das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) erwartet zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt keine ähnlich hohe Mortalität wie beim Ausbruch von Sars.\n"}, {"content": "RPT-China stocks off 2020 lows as Beijing calms nerves over virus outbreak.

Un nuevo virus tiene a China en alerta. Se trata de una misteriosa neumonía, de la que se han contagiado docenas de personas en la ciudad de Wuhan y que corresponde a una nueva cepa de un coronavirus similar al que en 2002 causó la epidemia de SARS (síndrome respiratorio agudo grave, por sus siglas en inglés). Así lo ha confirmado la televisión nacional china, CCTV, de acuerdo con las investigaciones de un grupo de científicos que ha logrado aislar la secuencia genética del agente infeccioso.\nLas pruebas médicas han confirmado la presencia de este nuevo patógeno en 15 de los 59 casos detectados desde principios de diciembre, todos ellos en Wuhan, capital de la provincia de Hubei. El origen de la mayoría de estas infecciones se ha localizado en un mercado de pescados y mariscos, en el que se comercializaban animales vivos. Desde entonces, la zona ha permanecido cerrada y en cuarentena. Hasta la fecha, ninguno de los enfermos ha fallecido e incluso ocho pacientes, los cuales ya no mostraban ningún síntoma, fueron dados de alta ayer miércoles. Las autoridades sanitarias locales han asegurado que no se ha detectado ninguna transmisión entre humanos.\nLos coronavirus, que reciben su nombre por la forma de corona que adoptan vistas al miscroscopio, suelen atacar las vías respiratorias de los mamíferos. Hasta la fecha solo se conocían seis. Cuatro provocan síntomas leves similares a los de un resfriado. Los otros dos, en cambio, son tristemente famosos: en 2002, el coronavirus del SARS, originado en China, causó la muerte de más de 700 personas en todo el mundo; mientras que en 2015 el MERS (síndrome respiratorio de Oriente Medio) dejó 449 muertos.\nDados los antecedentes, la noticia ha sido recibida con preocupación en el país. “Tengo mucho miedo. Recuerdo que el SARS apareció junto antes de la Fiesta de la Primavera y luego se expandió gracias a los medios de transporte”, escribía un usuario en Weibo, red social similar a Twitter. Sus palabras hacen referencia al año nuevo chino, que en 2020 tendrá lugar el próximo 25 de enero. Con motivo de esta festividad nacional, es tradición que la gente regrese al hogar familiar, provocando la mayor migración humana del mundo, con más de 3.000 millones de desplazamientos: un escenario ideal para la propagación de un virus.\nLa misteriosa dolencia, no obstante, podría haber saltado ya fuera de las fronteras del gigante asiático. En Corea del Sur, una mujer de nacionalidad china ha sido puesta en aislamiento ante la posibilidad de que esté infectada, según informó el miércoles el Centro de Control y Prevención de Enfermedades de Corea (KCDC). La mujer, de 36 años, fue diagnosticada el martes con neumonía, después de dos viajes de negocios en los que entre otras ciudades visitó Wuhan. Los países vecinos, mientras tanto, han comenzado a extremar las medidas de seguridad en aeropuertos.\nLa Organización Mundial de la Salud no considera necesario, de momento, establecer medidas especiales para viajeros. Así lo ha anunciado en un comunicado hecho público esta mañana, asegurando que “nuevos coronavirus aparecen periódicamente [...] y China tiene un sistema sanitario sólido, capaz de responder y gestionar brotes de infecciones respiratorias”. La institución, que ha mostrado su disposición a brindar apoyo técnico a las autoridades sanitarias del país, ha sentenciado que “en las próximas semanas será necesaria información más comprehensiva para entender mejor el estado actual y la epidemiología del brote”.\nEn la misma dirección se han expresado los científicos responsables de identificar el virus, asegurando que su hallazgo inicial debe completarse con más investigaciones. Aunque es posible obtener pruebas de la presencia de patógenos en un corto periodo de tiempo, la producción de una vacuna puede llevar años. El profesor David Hui Shu-cheong, experto en medicina respiratoria de la Universidad China de Hong Kong, ha asegurado al South China Morning Post que todavía faltan por esclarecer algunos detalles clave como “qué animal es la fuente del virus, el periodo de incubación y la ruta de transmisión”. Algunos especialistas, como Peng Yihong, profesor de la facultad de Medicina de Pekín, han aventurado que la causa del brote podría estar en “los patógenos contenidos en las cuevas kársticas, lugar de origen de muchos de los mariscos que van a parar al mercado”.\n"}, {"content": "Why all coronavirus cases in India are from Kerala. \nThe spotlight is now turned on the connect between Wuhan and Kerala as India's all three positive novel coronavirus cases so far are students of a university in the historic Chinese city, the epicentre of the epidemic.\nWuhan has been a popular destination for Keralites and others as an educational hub with quality and affordable medical courses attracting overseas scholars.\nImpressed by factors like affordability, amenities and international standards in medical education, offered in English, students from Kerala have been flocking to Wuhan University School of Medicine in China.\nWuhan, over 1,000 km from Chinese capital of Beijing and 800 plus km away from the top class metropolis Shanghai, is a historic city and played a key role in the 20th century history of China.\n\"I am very happy about the medical education system at Wuhan university.

Now comes the tricky part - shipping it there: Russell. LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China’s domestic coal mines are struggling to ramp up production in the face of the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. That’s a situation that may seem positive for seaborne exporters, but in reality it may be challenging for miners to take advantage.\nWhile there may be increased demand for imported coal in China in coming weeks, the problem for major exporters such as Indonesia, Australia and the United States is going to be one of logistics.\nThe coronavirus is starting to have an impact on supply chains and will make it more challenging for shippers to find vessels to go to China. And even if exporters do get their goods to Chinese ports, they will likely face headaches in unloading cargoes and transporting them from docks to end-users.\nBy Thursday, the country’s health authority said, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan had reached 563, with more than 28,000 others infected.\nWhile the fatalities and infections draw headlines, the impact of the virus is starting to cascade through China’s economy - as well as businesses in countries that trade heavily with the world’s largest consumer of commodities.\nThe challenge of shipping coal to China was illustrated by the Australian government’s decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on vessels leaving mainland China after Feb. 1.\nThis means such vessels will face delays upon reaching Australian ports, as the sailing time between China and both the east and west coasts of Australia is generally less than 14 days.\nVessel queues outside Australian coal ports are already lengthening. Argus Media reported on Feb. 4 that the number of ships waiting outside Newcastle, the world’s largest coal export harbor, was at an 18-month high of 20 vessels.\nThere are some other factors that may be contributing to longer vessel waiting times, such as weather and port and rail maintenance, but the overall trend is clear: Shipments to, as well as from, China are becoming more complicated to arrange.\nOne thing that is working in exporters’ favor is a sharp decline in shipping rates. The rate to ship coal from Newcastle to China dropped to $5.87 a tonne on Wednesday, the lowest in almost four years and about a third of the $16.49 peak reached in September last year.\nAt these freight prices, shipping companies will be losing money on every voyage, while they are also facing higher costs from the mandatory switch to cleaner fuels that kicked in last month as part of a change in global shipping regulations known as IMO2020.\nWhile the cost of shipping may be depressed, the main challenge will be securing vessels with owners prepared to send them to China.\nCertainly, Asian seaborne coal prices have yet to show any meaningful spike from China’s domestic coal woes.\nThe price of 6,000 kilocalorie per kilogram (kcal/kg) coal at Newcastle, as assessed by brokers Tullett Prebon climbed to $69.35 a tonne on Thursday, up from a recent low of $66.30 on Feb. 3, but still below the high so far this year of $72 on Jan. 13.\nThe price of lower-quality 4,200 kcal/kg coal from Indonesia has fared better, with the weekly Argus index rising to a six-month high of $35.48 a tonne in the week ended Jan. 31.\nThe rise in the Indonesian coal price follows similar gains in domestic prices in China, with thermal coal at Qinhuangdao, as assessed by SteelHome ending at 563 yuan ($80.66) on Wednesday, down slightly from 564 yuan on Feb. 4, which was the highest in three months.\nThe coal market appears to be reacting with caution to the coronavirus, with still considerable uncertainty over how much domestic output has been lost, what transport bottlenecks exist currently in China and whether more imported coal will be needed. Even if it is, can it get there efficiently?\nWhat is becoming clearer is that the efforts to contain the virus by limiting economic activity in China is going to have multiple flow-on effects through commodity supply chains.\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Developed countries pump aid to fight Covid-19, Britain latest to face lockdown.

WASHINGTON (AFP) - Chinese scientists reported on Thursday (March 26) it is possible, although rare, for pregnant mothers with the Covid-19 illness to pass the infection down to their babies. \n The team followed 33 pregnant women from Wuhan, the city where the disease behind a deadly pandemic was first identified - and found that three babies were infected with the new coronavirus at birth (a rate of nine per cent, albeit in a very small sample). \n They reported their findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Pediatrics, where they wrote: \"Because strict infection control and prevention procedures were implemented during the delivery, it is likely that the sources of SARS-CoV-2 in the neonates' upper respiratory tracts or anuses were maternal in origin.\" \n SARS-CoV-2 is the technical name for the virus. \n All three of the infected babies were male, and all were delivered by cesarean because their mothers had Covid-19 associated pneumonia. \n In addition, one of them was delivered prematurely, at 31 weeks, because of fetal distress, and required resuscitation. \n The two babies that were delivered on time experienced lethargy and fever, and one had pneumonia. Both were treated in intensive care units and tested negative for the virus on the sixth day of life. \n The premature baby experienced the most severe illness including pneumonia, shortness of breath and sepsis, which all eventually resolved with treatment in intensive care including ventilation, antibiotics and caffeine, while his coronavirus test returned negative on his seventh day of life. \n All three survived. \n Chinese experts have previously reported it may be possible that so-called \"vertical transmission\" from pregnant mothers to babies can occur after a newborn was detected with the virus 30 hours after birth. \n This might be occurring across the placenta, or during the process of childbirth. \n \"Therefore, it is crucial to screen pregnant women and implement strict infection control measures, quarantine of infected mothers, and close monitoring\" of newborns, the team concluded. \n "}, {"content": "Norte-americano é primeiro estrangeiro a morrer na China com o coronavírus.

Grace Dowell, a 63-year-old grandmother, has stopped grocery shopping and cancelled all her doctor’s appointments. No one is allowed into her rural Maryland home. Every piece of mail is disinfected.  \n Dowell decided last week that strict isolation was the only way to protect herself, her husband and her mother from COVID-19, the virus that has killed more than 10,000 people across the globe and is proving especially deadly for the elderly.  \n Dowell, a retired labour union worker, has rheumatoid arthritis and a compromised immune system. Her husband Donald, 74, suffers from emphysema. Her mother, Margaret Hildebrandt, 93, also has a lung disease and needs oxygen. Dowell took over her mother’s care from a visiting nurse because she worried an outsider could contaminate the home.  \n “If my mom gets this, she’d be gone in a day,” said Dowell, who wears a baby-monitor and answers her mother’s calls for help through the night. “My mom beat cancer nine times. I don’t want her to die from this.”  \n The elderly are especially vulnerable in the global pandemic and health officials and governments are increasingly calling for extreme measures to safeguard them. Across the globe, many cities have all but shut down as officials issue dire warnings for younger people - who can carry the virus without knowing it - to avoid their parents and grandparents. But this growing isolation of the elderly has spawned its own crisis, as families try to balance the need to care for loved ones with directives to stay away, shifting the burden to overstretched governments and medical facilities.  \n Studies suggest the severity of coronavirus rises with age. In Italy, which now has the world’s highest death count, the average age of those dying is 80, according to a study by the Italian national institute of health. In China, where the pandemic started, people 70 and older accounted for just 12 percent of all infections but more than half of all deaths, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States, people 65 and older have thus far accounted for 31 percent of cases, 53 percent of intensive care hospitalizations and 80 percent of deaths, according to U.S. government data.  \n Beyond the grim statistics, the pandemic has spawned countless small dramas of isolation and anxiety across the globe. In a village in Lebanon, a grandmother walled herself off in her home, unable to properly grieve her dead husband. In Spain, nursery home workers produced a Facebook video so residents could reassure their loved ones. And in Colombia - where the government on Tuesday ordered citizens 70 and over to stay inside until May 31 - seniors stocked up on supplies for two months of isolation.  \n “They need to take these measures because many people are taking the situation lightly,” said shopper Carlos Manrique, 74, as he loaded up on potatoes, eggs and rice at a supermarket in Bogota. “I’m taking care of myself, as God orders.”  \n Just as often, older people greeted the epidemic with defiance.  \n “I am not worried about the coronavirus at all,” said Yutaka Kobayashi, 85, who refuses to wear a mask while working in his Tokyo shoe store. “People of my generation were made to wash their hands by their mothers and grandmothers.”  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: GRAPHIC: Coronavirus kills older people at much higher rates - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-AGE/0100B5L744Y/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS.jpg)  \n  \n ‘HELLO GRAN, HOW ARE YOU?’  \n In Italy, where more than 3,400 people have died since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, local officials fret about the psychological state of elderly people confined to their homes for weeks in a government lockdown. The town of San Casciano in Val di Pesa launched an initiative called “Ciao Nonna, come stai?” or “Hello Gran, how are you?” urging all young people to call elderly relatives – or even older people they don’t know.  \n One nursing home, Nuestra Casa La Grande in Navares de Enmedio, Spain, recorded a video of 24 elderly residents and posted it on Facebook, encouraging each other to blow kisses to the camera for their loved ones.  \n Jonathan Barrios, a 24-year-old student living with his parents in La Parla, Madrid, said he doesn’t dare see his grandparents, who live on the same street. His 80-year-old grandfather has lung cancer. His grandmother, 70, has symptoms of the virus - a fever, cough and difficulty breathing - but can’t get tested because of a shortage of kits.  \n “I feel strange and frustrated,” Barrios said. “All I can do for my grandparents is to call them.”  \n The forced isolation perhaps cuts deepest for those in mourning. Joey Ayoub, a Lebanese researcher, said his grandfather died this week of problems unrelated to the coronavirus. He worries for his grandmother, who suddenly lives alone.  \n Only six or seven people attended her husband’s funeral, which Ayoub said would otherwise have attracted “dozens and dozens.” They all sat at a distance from one another during a rushed service.  \n \"She can't mourn properly,” he said. “She cannot do it with friends.”  \n  \n ‘IF I GET IT, I GET IT’  \n Some families have been hit hard when senior care centres closed, forcing them to take off work to watch over relatives. In the central Japan city of Nagoya, the mayor asked 126 such facilities to shut down for two weeks after a cluster of coronavirus cases was found at one of them.  \n Japan has already weathered serious outbreaks of the virus and has huge numbers of people at risk - more than 28 percent of the nation’s population is 65 or over. But now, some people are venturing out again.  \n \"If I get it, I get it,” said Kazuko Mori, 74, a part-time cleaner in suburban Ichikawa, which had clusters of cases originating at a sports gym and an elderly daycare service. “If you get too nervous about it all, that isn't good, either.\"  \n Many elderly people said they can’t follow government directives to stay home.  \n In Kibera, a settlement of densely packed neighbourhoods where few homes have running water in Kenya’s capital Nairobi, volunteers knocked on doors to tell people – especially the elderly – about the coronavirus. In one courtyard filled with children, Fatima Juma listened intently as Zulela Abdul explained the risks to her and handed over a small bottle of hand sanitizer.  \n Juma, who says she’s about 82, had heard of the disease on television but didn’t know its symptoms. She was fine with washing her hands but rejected the idea of social distancing. She takes care of her grandchildren, the youngest one two years old, while their parents worked. She also needed to see her friends, she said.  \n “This government directive is not good for me. I need to go to the market,” she said firmly, bangles flashing in the sunlight. “If there is a death outside, I need to go and console that person.”  \n In Communist-run Cuba, which has Latin America’s oldest population, many people are forced to work long after retirement age to supplement meagre pensions. Even in normal times, they endure long lines at stores and pharmacies.  \n \"I am very worried because I have asthma, and if I get it, I will die,\" said Maria Torres Hernandez, 75, waiting alongside dozens of others outside a pharmacy in central Havana that had just received its ration of supplies. “I have to look after myself.”  \n Angel Pupo Osorio, 80, works as a parking attendant in Havana to supplement his $12-a-month pension, and can’t afford to quit. So far, the disease hasn’t hit his neighbourhood.  \n “I’m going to continue working as long as I can, out of necessity,” said Pupo, wearing his uniform, a scarlet jacket and cap.  \n  \n ‘ISOLATE MYSELF HOW?’  \n Lucy Mayimela, a 68-year-old grandmother, first heard about the coronavirus on Monday when she made a trip to buy spinach for her fruit and vegetable stand in Kliptown, on the outskirts of Johannesburg. The farmer selling it to her wore a mask and insisted everyone repeatedly wash their hands before touching anything.  \n Mayimela laughed bitterly at a suggestion she heard on the radio that she should isolate herself at home.  \n “Isolate myself how?” she scoffed.  \n She lives in a small shack with six relatives, in a community with a single wash basin and toilet for dozens of people. The produce stand she has run for 36 years provides her family’s only income.  \n “I’ll end up dying of hunger” if people stay indoors, she said. “If God wants me to die, then it’s my time.” REUTERS \n "}, {"content": "u.s. cdc reports 44,183 coronavirus cases, 544 deaths.

NORWICH: The SARS outbreak in 2002 to 2003 was the first global pandemic of the 21st century. \n There were over 8,400 reported cases and 11 per cent of those infected with the virus died. Its cause was a newly identified coronavirus (a type of virus that causes respiratory infections): SARS Co-V. \n Early cases were linked to wildlife markets and restaurants in Guangdong, China, where researchers found SARS-like coronaviruses in animals including masked palm civets and a racoon dog. \n A Chinese government team subsequently reported that 66 out of 508 wildlife handlers tested in other markets across Guangdong were positive for antibodies to the SARS virus. \n The Chinese authorities responded by imposing a temporary ban on the hunting, sale, transportation and export of all wild animals in southern China. They also quarantined or culled civets reared for human consumption in the many civet farms across the area. \n THE WILDLIFE TRADE THREATENS HUMAN HEALTH \n Civets testing positive for SARS may have secondary infections rather than being the source of the virus. \n They were probably infected during the “speed dating” of zoonotic viruses circulating among the jumble of different animal species packed together at markets or while being transported to markets, often in China. \n At the Royal Society’s international conference on Lessons from SARS in 2004 and in the related publication, we emphasised that wildlife trade was a threat to human health and a primary cause of biodiversity decline in China and South-East Asia. \n But here we are again, 17 years later, with another novel zoonotic coronavirus, this time in Wuhan, China. Once again, initial human cases were linked to a market selling a variety of live animals. \n A constantly changing range of species have been selected as the culprits in the past few days, including bats and snakes, (the latter results were quickly refuted), and even crickets and wolf cubs. \n But, as yet, there is no scientific evidence that the virus has been isolated from any of these, although a recent report stated that “15 environmental specimens collected in the western section (of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) were positive for 2019-nCoV virus through testing and genetic sequencing analysis”. \n  \n The report continues: “Despite extensive searching, no animal from the market has thus far been identified as a possible source of infection.” \n It is not evident what “environmental specimens” refers to here and a complete list of those animals present in, or available from, the market would be appropriate to release together with details of which and how many of these have so far been tested. \n Wild rodents, which are often present in these markets, should also have been collected and tested as SARS-like coronaviruses have also been isolated from wild rats in China. \n PERFECT CONDITIONS FOR PANDEMICS \n But we may be chasing our tails, as animals testing positive may not be the source of the current outbreak. We need to step back and learn the broader lessons here. \n The perfect conditions for the emergence of human pandemics from previously unknown zoonotic pathogens has been created as a result of three things. \n First, the shift from subsistence hunting of wildlife to its sale into an international trade network largely driven by demand in China. \n Second, the extensive cross-exposure within this wildlife trade of species and species populations, which would not mix or be in contact in the wild. \n And, third, the exploitation of new source populations as areas become depleted of target species. \n  \n It is also important to emphasise that these wild animals are typically now more expensive to buy (sometime a status symbol) than domestic livestock, so the demand that perpetuates wildlife trade in the region is a dietary choice and not driven by low income. \n WILL REMOVING SUCH MARKETS HELP? \n The solution is collective action to remove the demand and also the supply chains to these wildlife markets and “farms” (often laundering animals from the wild rather than breeding them). \n The call to close wildlife markets across China – which started following the SARS outbreak – has also been echoed by experts in China and in external organisations worldwide, such as the Wildlife Conservation Society. \n We have to hope that the Wuhan outbreak is a wake-up call for regulation of wildlife trade and animal health, action that is urgently needed to protect human health and the environment. \n Diana Bell is Professor of Conservation Biology, University of East Anglia.

We know that people with infection were taken to places of isolation or quarantine in that general area,\" Klausner said.  \n UC Davis said no one on its main campus has tested positive for the virus, known as COVID-19, but \"out of an abundance of caution,\" three campus residents are currently in isolation. One of them, who is showing symptoms of illness, has been tested for the virus, but the results are not yet in.  \n The CDC's protocol had called for coronavirus testing in individuals with a fever or respiratory illness who have a travel history or contact that could have led to exposure to the virus.  \n California officials said this protocol had to be expanded in light of the \"inevitable\" local spread within the United States. At least 33 people had tested positive for the virus, but five have since left the state, official said.  \n \"The case from yesterday is giving the CDC a lot to consider on revising those protocols so more individuals will be tested,\" said Mark Ghaly director of California's Health and Human Services Agency, referring to the woman from Solano County.  \n  \n MORE KITS AND PERSONNEL  \n CDC Director Robert Redfield told a U.S. congressional hearing on Thursday that more test kits were being sent to California and the agency now backs expanded testing.  \n \"When a clinician or a public health individual suspects coronavirus, then we should be able to get a test for coronavirus, so that's the current guidance that went out today,\" he said.  \n Newsom said the CDC has pledged to send more personnel to California to track the potential spread of the virus.  \n With new infections reported around the world now surpassing those in mainland China, the World Health Organization's director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Thursday even rich nations should prepare.  \n \"No country should assume it won't get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally,\" Tedros said, pointing to Italy, where 17 people have died in Europe's worst outbreak.

Last Wednesday (Feb 19), Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat told Bloomberg TV in an interview that the Government has no plans to ease property cooling measures. \n “It is not on our radar at this point because we need to make sure that we stabilise the economy and we address long term structural issues,” he said.   \n This is understandable given that the Covid-19 outbreak has led to a percentage point downgrade in the official forecast of Singapore’s economic growth this year. \n At the same time, the outbreak will also have an adverse impact on the private residential market, with spillover effects on the entire real estate value chain and the longer-term stability of the property market.  \n Why is this so? \n Let’s take a look at where the market stands today as well as cooling measures such as the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD). \n Currently, developers now must build and sell all their units in a project within five years to get a remission of the ABSD on the land purchase price. \n Otherwise they will have to pay the 25 per cent ABSD, with interest. \n ABSD was 10 per cent when it was introduced in Dec 2011, before it was raised to 15 per cent in July 2013 and the current 25 per cent in July 2018. \n In 2020, developers are going to launch some 10,402 units from 48 projects, based on Cushman & Wakefield Research’s estimate. Of these, 4,765 units or 46 per cent will come from the luxury segment or the Core Central Region (CCR) segment. \n Traditionally, about 28 per cent of the buyers of CCR homes are permanent residents and foreigners from China, which has been hard hit by the Covid-19 outbreak. \n Singapore has since banned travellers who have visited mainland China recently, and the majority of that includes Chinese passport holders who could be the potential buyers of these luxury units. In 2019, non-PR China buyers bought a total of 359 units, of which 141 units were in the CCR. \n At a broader level, demand for private residential units might slow to a trickle soon, judging from the market reactions in our neighbouring countries affected by Covid-19. \n As an indication of how far sales could fall, China home sales plunged by 90 per cent in the first week of February compared to the same period in 2019, according to preliminary data on 36 cities compiled by China Merchants Securities Co.  \n Before the virus outbreak, the Singapore market was already expecting a more challenging sales environment in the coming months due to resistance to high prices and launch fatigue especially for smaller developments. The mood is now more bearish due to the virus outbreak. \n The temporary shortage of labour will also have an impact on the property market. \n Construction companies have expressed concerns about failing to meet deadlines due to workers from China not being able to return to Singapore and quarantine orders placed on affected workers in the industry. \n The authorities have urged developers not to penalise contractors and subcontractors for the unexpected delays. \n Beyond a temporary labour shortage, construction companies face a bigger and complex challenge arising from the global supply chain disruption caused by the lock-down in many China cities, with factories remaining shut or operating with reduced capacity. \n In Singapore, construction material and finished products are not expected to arrive in time for assembly or use. As manufacturers in China and the entire world are so interdependent, it is hard to predict how soon manufacturing would resume and at what capacity. \n What has made the situation more dire for Singapore construction firms is the mandatory adoption of the pre-fabricated pre-finished volumetric construction (PPVC) method at many Government Land Sales sites. \n Modern construction technology such as PPVC requires all components to be assembled off-site before they are delivered to the project site under construction. These include door, glass panels, tiles, sanitary ware etc. It does not allow construction to proceed if there is just one missing item. \n Although the current supply chain disruption would likely impact all stages of construction, the impact on PPVC construction would be more pronounced. \n The construction delay and the ripple effect beyond the short to medium term could have serious repercussions on the already fragile residential market. \n In about two to three years’ time, the Singapore residential market could deal with a supply overhang arising from the enbloc boom between 2017 and 2018. \n At the same time, all developers are bound by a five-year ABSD remission deadline that is fast approaching amid slower sales. \n On the supply front, there are 49,173 uncompleted private residential units (excluding executive condominiums) with planning approval. \n Of this, 30,162 remain unsold. There are also an additional 4,575 private residential units that do not have planning approval yet. \n Based on the 9,912 units sold in 2019, it should take developers roughly about five years to clear the existing stock and narrowly escape the ABSD penalty, assuming sales momentum in 2019 can be maintained this year. \n Looking at how things are now, it is unlikely that developers will be able to sell their projects at the same pace as previously anticipated.  \n In short, they could be hit with a double whammy – construction delays and potentially missing the ABSD deadline due to unforeseen circumstances which are no fault of theirs. \n Developers could slash prices drastically to try to move units but this could have a destabilising effect on the market as a whole. \n It is still fairly early days and how long the outbreak will last and how exactly it will affect the broader economy and the property market is still unclear.  \n But if the outbreak worsens, there is a case to be made for the authorities to extend the current ABSD deadline. \n The point is not only to provide much needed relief for developers, but to cushion the impact on the property sector. \n As it is, the current ABSD rule is too blunt a tool, as it does not differentiate the larger projects of hundreds or even thousands of units, from the smaller ones. \n As the economy is expected to head south, the larger projects have a much higher chance of missing the deadline, as they typically require a much longer time to sell out all the units especially during challenging times like now. \n An extension of the ABSD deadline would help developers to stagger new home sales and manage risks better arising from supply overhang. \n It would go a long way to help the market, long after the virus blows over, to avert a worst-case scenario that housing units are dumped in the open market in a disorderly manner, hurting both consumers and the economy. \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Christine Li is head of research for Singapore and Southeast Asia at global property consultancy Cushman & Wakefield. \n "}, {"content": "World should learn lessons from China in coronavirus fight - China Daily.

SINGAPORE — The Singapore stock market on Monday (March 9) suffered its largest single-day drop since October 2008, as markets around the globe were battered following a plunge in oil prices that fuelled rising alarm over the economic impact of Covid-19. \n After weeks of slow and gradual decline, the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) nosedived 6 per cent — shedding 178.61 points to 2,782.37. \n It was the worst fall since the height of the global financial crisis and dragged the main market index to its lowest levels since 2016. \n The massive selloff across the globe was triggered by a plunge in oil prices after the world’s major oil producers failed to reach an agreement on cutting production, which sparked a price-cutting war in an environment where supply is exceeding waning demand. \n Among many global losers, Japan’s Nikkei sank 5 per cent and Australia’s ASX 200 dived 7.3 per cent. \n Market experts in Singapore warned investors not to take their chances during such turbulent times, and to leave the analysis and guesswork to the professionals. \n The STI, an index which tracks the performance of the top 30 companies listed on the Singapore Exchange, saw all three banks here — DBS, OCBC and UOB — fall by at least 6 per cent. Conglomerate Keppel Corp tanked by almost 10 per cent, Genting Singapore dropped 6 per cent and Singapore Airlines was down 4.5 per cent. \n Analysts warned investors against thinking that this might sound like a good time to enter the stock market and pick up some bargains among blue chips. \n They said that this is a time to be extra cautious because the confluence of factors that are causing the current market carnage is unprecedented, and there is no knowing how long the market bloodshed will last. \n WHY DID THE MARKET PLUNGE? \n The plunge in the STI, experts told TODAY, was largely due to a meeting of two “black swans”— an oil price war and an airline industry robbed of demand from the Covid-19 outbreak. A black swan event is one that comes as a complete surprise and has deep consequences. \n On Friday, Russia refused to join the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in a large production cut as the Covid-19 outbreak continues to slow the global economy along with the demand for oil, the New York Times reported. \n In retaliation, Saudi Arabia decided to cut oil prices by nearly 10 per cent on Saturday. \n Price wars such as these have led to steep falls in oil prices before, as in 2016. However, experts said that with the Covid-19 outbreak looming in the background, there are no “winners” in this situation. \n Mr Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking, said that when there is a sharp fall in oil prices, there will normally be winners and losers, but in this instance, it is a “loser-loser” situation. \n “Normally, the airline industry has been the primary beneficiary of such a sharp plunge in oil prices. Now, no one wants to take (a plane). \n “Had it just been the oil price war without the coronavirus outbreak fears, we would all be travelling to Japan for S$1 priced tickets. But now, even with that pricing, we would be scared to go,” he said. \n Ms Pan Jingyi, a market strategist at brokerage firm IG, said that besides the fall in oil prices, the increase in the number of infections outside of China has caused negative sentiment in the market. \n This is due to the growth in Covid-19 cases in countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea, where case numbers have spiked from the tens to the thousands in the span of weeks. \n “The backdrop still being the coronavirus impact that’s causing quite a lot of turmoil in the market,” she said. “The hit on demand is already the general situation in the market, and the market has processed that in.” \n WHAT SHOULD INVESTORS DO? \n Mr Terence Wong, chief executive officer of fund management company Azure Capital, said that due to the “many unknowns out there”, punters should not be investing “aggressively” at the moment. \n “It could have other impacts on other parts of the economy that you may not think about,” he said. “If you asked me last week, I couldn’t tell that this would happen… There will be a high degree of risk (to invest) right now.” \n Agreeing, Mr Song said that investment during such dire circumstances should be left to the professionals. \n “We have the virus outbreak plus a price war, I don’t think laymen are equipped to deal with this kind of fluid landscape,” he said. \n Though the experts generally warned against investing during this period of turmoil, there could be a sliver of opportunity for those willing to take the risk. \n If one had to choose certain industries to invest in, it should be more stable industries such as primarily consumer staples, which includes producers of food, household goods and other essentials, Ms Pan said. \n Mr Song added that the healthcare sector, especially health care services and medical equipment manufacturers, are set to do well during this period. \n A larger risk would be to invest in cyclical stocks, those that are tied to the business cycle, Ms Pan said. These include companies in the industrial sector or those that deal with energy production. \n WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE STOCK MARKET \n The rate at which the market will recover depends not just on the spread of the virus, but the fear among the population, the analysts said. \n Mr Wong of Azure Capital believes that the market will recover when the number of cases stabilises. Now that the number of cases is still “jumping around”, this will cause uncertainty in the market, he said. \n “If you look at China, the number of new cases has already been decreasing,” he said. “If, globally, we didn’t see wild numbers… I think we could have already made a recovery in the market.” \n Mr Song agreed that consumer fears play a bigger role in curbing demand than the actual number of cases does. \n “(Chances of a rebound) depends on how confident market participants are about the outbreak being contained, the most important being the fear factor,” he said. \n However, when a rebound will come is hard to tell, which makes it difficult to know when one should start investing again. \n Ms Pan said: “With every market shock, there will be a recovery, but the problem this time is that we are dealing with something that is very uncertain (with the) coronavirus. Perhaps we will need to see a vaccine come through, to be a remedy (to the economy).” \n In the meantime, players in the market can only hope that the worst will be over soon, but there is no indication of how big the hit on the market will continue to be, or how long it will last. \n The analysts said that they expect the STI to fall further to around 2,500-point levels, down from the current 2,782. \n In the last five years, STI closed at its lowest of 2,539 points in February 2016. \n Mr Wong said that it is ultimately wiser to hold off investing during an uncertain economy rather than hope to profit from it. \n “You can see the tide coming, but you can’t tell how big it’s going to be,” he said. “If it’s a ripple, that’s fine. But what if it builds up to a tsunami wave? \n “There’s no need to be a hero… I still think that cash (rather than investments) will be king right now.” \n "}, {"content": "WRAPUP 4-U.S. could be next 'virus epicentre', as India locks down, global recession looms.

We are helping the states to get equipment, but it is not easy,” he tweeted.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday the government would impose a nationwide lockdown from midnight for 21 days.\nHealth researchers have warned that more than a million people in India could be infected with the coronavirus by mid-May, prompting the government to shut down all air and train travel, businesses and schools.\nOn Tuesday, Modi, leader of the world’s biggest democracy, went further, saying nobody would be allowed to leave their homes.\n“The only way to save ourselves from coronavirus is if we don’t leave our homes, whatever happens, we stay at home,” Modi said.\nIndia has so far reported 482 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and nine deaths.\nOlympic Games organizers and the Japanese government had clung to the hope that the world’s biggest sporting event could go ahead, but finally bowed to the inevitable to make Tokyo 2020 the latest and biggest victim of a ravaged sporting calendar.\nAfter a call with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the July 24-Aug. 9 event would be rescheduled for the summer of 2021 at the latest - as proof of victory over the coronavirus.\n“President Bach said he is in agreement, 100%.”\nIt was the first time in the Olympics’ 124-year history that they had been postponed, though they were canceled outright three times during the two 20th-century world wars.\nOf the top 10 countries by case numbers, Italy has reported the highest fatality rate, at around 10%, which at least partly reflects its older population. The fatality rate globally - the ratio of deaths to confirmed infections - is around 4.3%, though national figures can vary widely according to how much testing is done.\nBritain, believed by experts to be about two weeks behind Italy in the outbreak cycle, on Tuesday began curbs on movement without precedent in peacetime after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered the country to stay at home.\nThe streets of the capital were quiet as all but essential shops closed and people only went to work if it was unavoidable.\nJohnson had resisted pressure to impose a full lockdown even as other European countries had done so, but was forced to change tack as projections showed the health system could become overwhelmed.\nMeanwhile China’s Hubei province, the original center of the outbreak, will lift curbs on people leaving the area, but other regions will tighten controls as new cases double due to imported infections.\nThe provincial capital Wuhan, which has been in total lockdown since Jan. 23, will lift its travel restrictions on April 8.\nHowever, the risk from overseas infections appears to be on the rise, prompting tougher screening and quarantine measures in  cities such as the capital Beijing.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: How it could have jumped from animals to humans and other questions answered. SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Wednesday (Jan 22) that it is setting up a multi-ministry task force to tackle the mysterious Wuhan virus that has already infected more than 400 people in China. \n Although it has yet to reach Singapore's shores, increased air travel in the lead-up to the Chinese New Year holidays has led to the ministry - as well as other agencies across the world - stepping up precautionary measures to either prevent entry of the disease or contain its spread. \n As of Wednesday afternoon, the Wuhan virus, a type of coronavirus which causes pneumonia in its victims, has claimed nine lives. \n But what is the virus and how did the Wuhan virus spread to people? \n Here are some questions and answers about the Wuhan coronavirus behind the latest outbreak. \n Viruses are microscopic parasites that lack the ability to survive and reproduce outside living organisms, which includes animal, humans and even bacteria. \n For this reason, it is debatable if they are truly \"alive\". They become active only when they come into contact with living cells, which they then try to hijack to produce more viruses. \n Even so, viruses are made of biological material and have the biggest population of any biological entity on earth, triggering responses in living things that range from unnoticeable reactions to death. \n Some experts believe that nearly 10 per cent of the current human genome is viral genetic material, as a result of viruses infecting human cells for millennia. \n They belong to a large group of viruses that usually infect only animals, and are so named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. \n But from the mid-1960s, scientists began identifying coronaviruses that affect humans, with seven types of these viruses classified to date, according to the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. \n Four of these typically cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses like the common cold, with well-known symptoms such as sore throats, cough, and headaches. \n But the remaining three have more recently caused severe repercussions on human health as scientists scrambled to understand them. \n The first is the infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) coronavirus, which killed almost 800 people in 32 countries 17 years ago. \n The other two are the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Mers-CoV), which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and later spread further, and the latest Wuhan virus (2019-nCov) which killed its first victims in the Chinese city of Wuhan. \n Scientists have speculated that the virus from the latest Wuhan outbreak, like the Mers and Sars viruses that preceded it, evolved from coronavirus strains that previously affected only animals. \n This ability of a virus to \"jump\" from animals to humans is not unusual and has given rise to a category of illnesses called zoonotic diseases, which also counts among its ranks diseases caused by non-coronavirus viruses like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Ebola. \n Zoonotic viruses generally have a single strand of genetic material called RNA, which is more easily copied or mutated than humans' double-stranded DNA, which accounts for their virality. \n To date, the Wuhan coronavirus has been closely linked to Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, which reportedly also peddled live animals like deer and animal parts in addition to seafood. \n Scientists have said such \"unnatural situations\", where animals are brought together and often housed in bad conditions in close proximity to people, create opportunities for viruses to hop between animals. The virus could then have changed so that it is able to infect humans and eventually start spreading between people. \n Every virus typically infects a certain type of living host organism, said Dr Sebastian Maurer-Stroh, deputy executive director of research at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's (A*Star) Bioinformatics Institute. \n \"Viruses can shift their host preference through mutations... Some viruses mutate much faster,\" he added. \n The Wuhan coronavirus is understood to spread much like the common flu does - through the air when an infected person coughs, through close contact such as shaking hands with an infected person, or touching an object with the virus on it before touching one's mouth and eyes. \n For now, virologists have said that the Wuhan coronavirus - based on reported rates of infection - is likely not as infectious as the Sars virus. But there are concerns that the Wuhan virus' current reported 2 per cent death rate - two out of 100 infected people die - is not representative and that the virus could further mutate to become more lethal. \n Dr Michael Wong, a senior family physician at Raffles Medical, said the virulence of the Wuhan virus cannot be underestimated. “With mutations, the virus could increase in virulence and transmissibility, leading to a serious pandemic,” he said. \n The Chinese government has classified the Wuhan virus outbreak in the same category as the Sars epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement quarantine measures on travel, said Dr Wong. \n There are also worries that the number of infections is yet under-reported, with many brushing off symptoms as those of the common flu. \n It is a different strain and, for now, has reported a lower fatality rate than the Sars virus. \n The World Health Organisation estimates that the overall fatality rate for Sars patients to be between 14 per cent and 15 per cent, while that for Wuhan is currently at 2 per cent. \n Researchers have said that the Wuhan virus shares only 76 per cent of its genetic material with the Sars virus - a big difference in genetic terms much like \"comparing a dog and a cat\". \n There is, however, speculation that both viruses originated from bats. Recent reports have also suggested that the Wuhan virus might be linked to snakes too. \n No, said professor Paul Tambyah, from the department of medicine at NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. \n “I don’t think we should panic as panic is never a good approach.” \n Instead, we should be concerned. \n He said there are measures in place to control the outbreak here and elsewhere. The public should be concerned and thus be vigilant about maintaining good hand hygiene, seeking medical attention if unwell and staying home, he said. \n Wear a surgical mask when you have a cold or flu, to prevent the transmission of airborne germs. \n Some doctors have been wearing surgical masks as a precautionary measure at work, so some people may wonder if they should dig out their N95 masks too. \n But there is no need to, said professor Leo Yee Sin, the executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Instead, they should wear surgical masks.  \n “N95 masks are of a very special design. They are very difficult to breathe in. If you find the N95 mask easy to breathe in and comfortable, you are wearing it wrong and it’s no use,” she said. “It’s only when it is difficult to breathe that you are wearing it correctly.” \n It is thus not recommended for the general public, she said. \n In fact, if you use it wrongly, it may make things worse because you think you are protected when you are not, she said. \n Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital said that everyone with respiratory symptoms must wear masks, now that there’s human to human transmission. \n The MOH on Thursday said Singaporeans should avoid travelling to Wuhan, stepping up a notch from its advice on Wednesday for people to defer non-essential travel there. \n The ministry said it updated the travel advisory \"in view of the developing novel coronavirus situation in Wuhan and other parts of China\", with confirmed cases spreading beyond Wuhan to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangdong, which abuts densely populated Hong Kong. \n It also cited the travel halt imposed by the Chinese authorities on Thursday, as all flights out of the city were cancelled and trains, buses and ferries suspended. \n The MOH reminded the public to continue to exercise caution and pay attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of China. \n All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon returning to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history, said the ministry. \n If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms like a cough or runny nose, they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit. \n Singapore is stepping up precautionary measures, in anticipation of more travellers in the lead-up to the Chinese New Year holidays. \n The expanded measures include temperature screening for all travellers arriving from China – not just Wuhan alone – at Changi Airport from Wednesday and issuing health advisory notices to them. \n “However, people who are in the incubation period – likely seven to 14 days based on known characteristics of other corona viruses – might not have started showing symptoms such as a fever, and, hence, not be detected by the thermal scanners,” said Raffles Medical’s Dr Wong. \n “With increased awareness of the infection, it is hoped that those who experience symptoms would isolate themselves and see a doctor as soon as possible so as to prevent spreading the infection.” \n There is no specific treatment to cure illnesses caused by human coronaviruses, including pneumonia caused by the Wuhan virus. \n Patients typically recover on their own after some time by depending on their immune system to fight the infection. \n Treatment mostly involves tackling flu-like symptoms from infections and making patients more comfortable, such as providing them with breathing apparatus to help with breathing difficulties. \n In some cases, antiviral drugs are available to shorten the duration or reduce the severity of the illness by decreasing the ability of the coronavirus to reproduce, effectively isolating it. \n A*Star's Dr Maurer-Stroh said that \"as a rule of thumb, a virus that spreads widely is often less severe\". \n A flu vaccine will not help protect you against the Wuhan coronavirus. There is no vaccine to protect against coronaviruses. The influenza virus, that a flu jab protects against, is not a coronavirus. \n However, according to an advisory from Raffles Medical, you should still get a flu jab if you are travelling to exposed areas to prevent you from contracting influenza symptoms and signs that may mislead screening authorities at temperature checkpoints. \n "}, {"content": "Beijing quarantines returning residents as China struggles to pick up economy. People returning to the Chinese capital Beijing from extended holidays on Friday were ordered to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine to help prevent spread of the new coronavirus, as hard-hit Hubei province reported more than 2,400 new cases.\nThe official Beijing Daily newspaper said people failing to obey would be punished but it was not immediately clear how that would be enforced, or whether the restrictions would apply to non-residents of Beijing or foreigners arriving from abroad.\n\"From now on, all those who have returned to Beijing should stay at home or submit to group observation for 14 days after arriving,\" read the notice from Beijing's virus prevention working group cited by the Beijing Daily.\n\"Those who refuse to accept home or centralized observation and other prevention and control measures will be held accountable under law,\" it said.\nStricter containment measures were planned elsewhere as well. Honghu city in Hubei province imposed a \"wartime\" lock-down beginning on Friday, with strict management of entry into housing compounds and villages, according to an official social media account of the local police, China's CCTV reported.\nHubei officials said there were 2,420 new cases on Friday and 139 more deaths.\nA top Chinese official, in an interview with Reuters, acknowledged that coronavirus was a huge challenge, but defended Beijing's management of the epidemic and lashed out at the \"overreaction\" of some countries.\nState Councillor Wang Yi, who also serves as China's foreign minister, said China has taken decisive measures to fight the epidemic, many going beyond international health regulations and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations.\n\"Through our efforts the epidemic is overall under control,\" he said.\nChina is struggling to get the world's second largest economy going after the annual Lunar New Year holiday, which was extended by 10 days to help contain the highly contagious virus.\nIncluding the latest numbers from Hubei at the epicenter of the outbreak, the total number of cases in mainland China now exceeds 66,000, with more than 1,500 deaths.\nThe figures show no sign that the outbreak is nearing a peak, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Center for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney.\nWith 500 million people already affected by movement and travel restrictions, President Xi Jinping warned top officials last week that efforts to contain the virus had gone too far and were threatening the economy, sources said.\nIn Beijing and the business hub Shanghai, streets and subways remain largely deserted with many shops and restaurants empty or shut.\nGovernment employee Jin Yang, 28, made it to his Beijing office and found it \"anything but normal.\"\nCanteen lunches are banned in favor of boxed meals eaten at desks. Meetings are held online, not in person. Employees must wear masks all day and report their temperature twice a day as fever is one of the virus' main symptoms.\nOutside mainland China, there have been nearly 450 cases in some 24 countries and territories, and three deaths. Japan confirmed its first coronavirus death on Thursday. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines.\nWUHAN'S SELF-HELP\nWuhan, the central Chinese city of 11 million people where the outbreak began, has been hardest hit by the virus.\nWith all public transport, taxis and ride-hailing services shut down in the city, volunteer drivers are responding to requests on ad hoc messaging groups to ferry medical staff and others in vital jobs to and from work, risking their own health.\nOthers work round the clock to find accommodation for medical workers in hotels that have volunteered rooms. Graphic: Comparing new coronavirus to SARS and MERS - here\n\"Everyone in our group has such a strong sense of mission,\" said 53-year-old Chen Hui, who runs one of the ad hoc ride services.\nThe virus is killing around 2% of those infected, but has spread faster than other respiratory viruses that emerged this century.\nA WHO-led joint mission with China will start its outbreak investigation work this weekend, focusing on how the new coronavirus is spreading and its severity, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nThe mission will also seek more details on how, where and when the more than 1,700 healthworkers infected contracted the new virus, WHO officials said.\nThe mission will also look into what \"information is needed so that the world can use this window of opportunity to prepare health systems and workers for possible outbreaks,\" Tedros said.\nSLOWDOWN\nEconomists polled by Reuters said China's economic downturn would be short-lived if the outbreak was contained, but expected this quarter would show China's slowest growth rate since the global financial crisis.\nThe Chinese carmakers' association said auto sales in China were likely to slide more than 10% in the first half of the year because of the epidemic.\nVietnam has imposed a 20-day quarantine on Son Loi, a rural community outside Hanoi where 11 of the country's 16 coronavirus cases are located, two local officials said.\nThe virus is taking its toll on the $46 billion global ocean cruise industry.\nThe biggest cluster of infections outside China has been on a cruise liner quarantined in a Japanese port, with 218 people on board infected and taken to hospital.\nOn Friday, some passengers were allowed to disembark to complete their quarantine onshore.\n"}, {"content": "Un error en una investigación aviva el debate científico sobre el coronavirus en pacientes asintomáticos. Un error de investigación de los autores de un breve artículo publicado en forma de carta por la prestigiosa revista The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) el pasado jueves ha avivado el debate científico sobre una de las cuestiones clave aún por resolver de la epidemia del coronavirus de Wuhan: si los pacientes asintomáticos pueden transmitir la enfermedad.\nEl escrito aseguraba que una trabajadora china del sector de la automoción había contagiado la enfermedad a dos compañeros —y uno de ellos a otros dos— de la sede alemana de la compañía durante un curso de formación. \"Durante su estancia, ella había estado bien y sin síntomas de la infección, pero enfermó durante el vuelo de regreso a China\", publicaron los investigadores. \nLos autores, sin embargo, no habían hablado con la mujer. Uno de ellos, Michael Hoelscher, del hospital de la Universidad de Múnich, ha explicado a la revista Science que fueron los compañeros contagiados los que les explicaron que esta \"no parecía tener síntoma alguno\"·\nLa agencia de salud pública alemana, el Instituto Robert Koch, sí lo hizo posteriormente y la mujer les explicó que se había sentido \"cansada, con dolores musculares y que había tomado paracetamol\", un antitérmico, durante su estancia en Europa. Esto ha llevado al Instituto a remitir una carta al NEJM solicitando una rectificación del artículo y a informar a la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) y al resto de agencias europeas sobre los nuevos hallazgos.\nEl artículo tuvo un gran impacto en la comunidad científica ya que era el primero publicado en una revista de prestigio que confirmaba lo avanzado por el ministro de Sanidad chino, Ma Xiaowei, el domingo 26 de enero: que las personas que desarrollaban la enfermedad sí podían transmitir el virus desde días antes de mostrar los primeros síntomas.\n\"No hay ninguna duda después de leer el artículo de que la transmisión desde pacientes asintomáticos está ocurriendo\", afirmó el director del Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Infecciosas y Alergias de Estados Unidos, Anthony Fauci. Grandes medios en todo el mundo, entre ellos EL PAÍS, también se hicieron eco de lo publicado por NEJM por su relevancia.\nPese a lo ocurrido con NEJM, Fauci se muestra convencido de que los contagios de personas asintomáticas están ocurriendo. \"He llamado a uno de mis colegas en China, que es un científico muy respetado en temas de salud, y me ha dicho que está convencido de que algunas personas están cursando la infección de forma asintomática y que algunos infectados asintomáticos están transmitiendo la enfermedad\", ha explicado Fauci a la revista Science.\nLa posibilidad de que pacientes asintomáticos puedan contagiar el coronavirus alerta a los expertos por las dificultades que esto entrañaría en el control de la expansión del patógeno. Obligaría, por ejemplo, a ampliar los estudios de contactos de los enfermos diagnosticados a los días anteriores al desarrollo de los síntomas y restaría utilidad a medidas de control adoptadas en muchos aeropuertos, como la vigilancia de la temperatura corporal. \nQue los periodos de incubación —cuando un enfermo ya tiene el virus pero aún no sufre síntomas— y de transmisión —cuando es capaz de transmitirlo— se solapen algunos días no es infrecuente en las enfermedades infecciosas, también las respiratorias. Por ello médicos y científicos aguardan casi desde las primeras fases de la epidemia de Wuhan información y estudios que aporten luz sobre si esto se produce.\n\"Es algo que aumentaría la incertidumbre sobre el efecto de algunas de las medidas de prevención adoptadas\", explicó a este diario el pasado viernes Jesús Rodríguez Baño, jefe de servicio de enfermedades infecciosas del Hospital Virgen Macarena (Sevilla). “La detección de casos asintomáticos tendrá implicaciones cuando sepamos si esto pasa siempre o solo en algunos casos. Quedan varias incógnitas por resolver”, añadió el médico del servicio de salud internacional del Hospital Clínic de Barcelona e investigador de ISGlobal.\nAmbos investigadores coinciden en que la cuestión aún está sin respuesta. Aunque destacan que \"en todo caso, la expansión del coronavirus está siendo principalmente por pacientes ya enfermos y si las transmisiones en asintomáticos existen, tienen un papel secundario en la evolución del brote\". \nEn su reporte diario sobre la evolución de la epidemia, la OMS sostuvo el pasado sábado que tiene noticia de \"la posible transmisión del 2019-nCoV\", nombre provisional dado al patógeno, \"de algunas personas infectadas antes de que desarrollen síntomas\". El organismo se remitió a las investigaciones en marcha \"para comprender mejor las fases preclínicas de la infección y cómo pueden haber ocurrido las transmisiones\". En todo caso, la OMS también sostiene que este tipo de contagios \"no parecen ser una vía importante de transmisión del virus\".\n"}, {"content": "Covid-19.

The WHO said it took 67 days for Covid-19 outbreak to infect first 1 lakh patients on March 7.\nBut to infect another 1 lakh people, the coronavirus took just 12 days. On March 19, the numbers crossed 2 lakh. During this phase, the daily count of fresh novel coronavirus cases kept rising consistently barring on a few days. (See table below)\nThe next 1 lakh patients got Covid-19 in just four days, with global count crossing 3 lakh on March 23. On March 25, the WHO count for global Covid-19 patients crossed 4 lakh. It means the last 1 lakh novel coronavirus patients were added to the list in just two days.\nTotal deaths as on March 25 due to Covid-19 stood at 18,440 with more than 2200 losing the battle against novel coronavirus in the last 24 hours, according to WHO report.\nNow compare this trend with the trend in India.\nIndia reported its first Covid-19 case on January 30. It was the same day that the WHO declared novel coronavirus a global emergency.\nBy February 3, there were three cases in India.\nOn February 20, all three Covid-19 patients were discharged after they recovered from infection.\nBy February 28, India had tested 2,880 samples, of which 1,572 were samples from outside quarantine centres. Only three had tested positive.\nMarch 2, two cases were reported - one each from Delhi and Hyderabad.\nOn March 10, the Covid-19 cases reached 50 and on March 15 it crossed 100-mark (107). On March 20 - with 50 new cases - novel coronavirus cases jumped to 223. That is, India reported 105 cases in 13 days between March 2 and 5. But in just next five days, the country recorded 118 more cases.\nIn another four days, the number crossed 500 on March 24, when official number of Covid-19 patients was 519. That is, India saw almost 300 fresh cases after it breached 200-mark.\nAt noon on March 26, the official data put the number of Covid-19 patients at 649, 593 of them being active cases treated in different hospitals. That is, in 15 days (March 11-26), coronavirus cases in India increased nearly 13 times.\nThe official death count due to novel coronavirus infection stood at 13 while 42 Covid-19 have been cured and discharged from hospitals.\nClearly, India is following the same pattern as other novel coronavirus-affected countries across continents. The only relief here is that the number is not phenomenal given India's proximity to China and its huge population base. But some say the lower number is due to fewer than required testing done by government agencies in India.\nNow that national lockdown has been enforced, the authorities hope the accelerated rate of increase in novel coronavirus cases will slow down in days to come.\n"}, {"content": "False claim: African skin resists the coronavirus.

Both also mention a man named Zanomoya KaTshatshu or Zanomoya Mditshwa, who gave his opinion:\n“Caucasians is always at war with our black skin because they know our melanin is our defense against all that they throw at us. This proves yet again that the black man is indestructible, our bodies are made of the same substances that make up this Earth because we are owners of this universe, they will never wipe us off, history has already proved that.”\nNeither article gives details on the identity of this man. The articles refer to him as “an African” who shared his opinion. There is no elaboration of his profession or connection to the story. The articles in question also refer to “Chinese doctors” but do not provide names.\nA student who contracted the coronavirus in the region is 21-year-old man named Kem Senou Pavel Daryl from Cameroon. He was living in Jingzhou, China. He was the first African man to have contracted and be cured of the virus. He was hospitalized in isolation for 13 days and treated with a combination of drugs (BBC reported his case, see  here  ). Reuters journalists also spoke to this individual, and his family, to confirm details.\nSenou’s recovery has nothing to do with his genetic composition, as the referenced articles suggest.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak can still be beaten, the World Health Organization said on Monday, insisting it was premature to declare it a pandemic even though it had the potential to reach that level.\n“The key message that should give all countries hope, courage and confidence is that this virus can be contained,   indeed there are many countries that have done exactly that,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva.\n“Using the word ‘pandemic’ now does not fit the facts but may certainly cause fear,” he added as the number of cases continued to mount internationally and financial markets spun lower.\n“We must focus on containment while doing everything we can to prepare for a potential pandemic.”\nTedros said a sudden increase of cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea were “deeply concerning” but for now authorities were not seeing an uncontained global spread of the virus or witnessing widespread serious cases or deaths.\nThe WHO already declared a public health emergency of international concern, its “highest level of alarm”, last month when there were fewer than 100 cases outside China and 8 cases of human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 virus that started in China.\n“Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely, it has,” Tedros said. “Are we there yet?

SINGAPORE — Following an increase in imported Covid-19 cases from European countries, Singapore will deny entry to new visitors who have been to Italy, France, Spain and Germany in the last two weeks, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (March 13). \n From 11.59pm on Sunday, such visitors will also not be allowed to transit through Singapore, the ministry added. \n Singaporeans are also advised to defer all non-essential travel to the four countries as they have seen “very high numbers of cases and very high rates of increase”, MOH said in a statement. \n And with immediate effect, all travellers who show symptoms of fever or respiratory illness and who thus have to undergo a Covid-19 swab test at Singapore’s checkpoints will have to serve a 14-day stay-home notice, during which time they cannot leave their place of residence at all.  \n They will have to serve the stay-home notice in full even if the result of the swab test is negative, MOH said. \n From 11.59 pm on Sunday, Singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders with travel history to the four countries within the last 14 days will be issued with a stay-home notice. Those issued the notice will have to stay home at all times for 14 days after returning to Singapore. \n Singapore will also cease port calls for all cruise vessels with immediate effect, the ministry added.  \n The latest round of stepped up border controls comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 a pandemic on Wednesday, as the coronavirus has infected more than 125,000 people in 118 countries, and killed more than 4,000. \n WHO's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland that in the last two weeks alone, cases outside China have increased 13-fold and the number of affected countries has tripled. \n MOH said that as of March 12, almost 25 per cent of the confirmed cases in Singapore were imported.  \n In the last 10 days alone, there have been 23 imported cases, making up nearly a third of all new cases, including 13 people with travel history to European countries and six from Indonesia. \n Speaking at a media briefing on Friday, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said: “We've said before that as we get further into the epidemic and as it becomes a global pandemic, increasingly border control measures may become less effective because we cannot identify specific countries. \n “But at this stage of the epidemic, we still see very high numbers and rapid increases in a few specific countries, especially in Europe. We are also seeing more imported cases recently, and that's why we think there is still a need to tighten border measures… in order to limit imported cases in Singapore.” \n He added that Singapore needs more “rigorous surveillance at our borders”. \n “Beyond specific countries, both previous and new ones we introduce today… (we are) concerned about countries with few reported cases of the virus. \n Mr Wong said these include neighbouring countries such as Indonesia, from which Singapore has had six imported cases, and Malaysia, where two Singaporeans attended a recent event and were diagnosed with Covid-19 after their return. \n Also speaking at the briefing, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong added that two days ago, Singapore saw its highest number of imported cases since the outbreak began.  \n “Control measures remain important to lower the risk of imported cases, (but) even as we continue to tighten border control, we know it would not be tenable for us to close borders to every affected country and region, and shut ourselves out,” he added. \n “We need to ensure measures are sustainable in the long term and life can go on.” \n Asked if the border restrictions were prompted by the move by the United States to ban travellers from European countries, Mr Wong said: “Our measures, social distancing or travel restrictions, are informed by data, evidence and expert advice, not based on what other countries are doing.” \n He added: “How long can we go on with this? We know what our limits are. If infection spreads at a rapid rate all over the world, continuing on this path would effectively shut Singapore out from the world and we don’t want to get there.” \n Mr Wong said that at some point, Singapore would want to shift to a different approach for border surveillance.  \n “If indeed we are moving in that direction, there will be a limit to how many countries we impose travel restrictions on and we will need a different way of doing border surveillance.” \n MOH also issued a list of countries and regions with known and potential exported cases, and is advising Singaporeans to exercise caution when travelling to these places. \n Mainland China \n Egypt \n France \n Germany \n Hong Kong \n India \n Italy \n Indonesia \n Iran \n Israel \n Japan \n Malaysia \n Philippines \n Republic of Korea \n Spain \n Thailand \n United Kingdom \n United States \n "}, {"content": "Second Singaporean evacuated from Wuhan tested positive for coronavirus.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The language commonly used to describe speculative manias is borrowed from epidemiology. A new technology sparks “contagion”. Investors are “infected” with greed. Speculative “fever” breaks out. During the panic phase, contagion becomes more “virulent”. After the South Sea Bubble collapsed 300 years ago, contemporary observers likened the market situation to a plague. In fact, by late 1720 the bubonic plague was spreading across Europe. Today, the world is faced with another epidemic. The response to coronavirus resembles the inverse of a speculative mania, with fear replacing greed, and errors of pessimism those of optimism.\nIn his engaging and eerily well-timed new book, “The Rules of Contagion”, Adam Kucharski observes that bubbles and diseases go through similar growth phases. Both experience periods of exponential growth. Eventually the spread peaks, the bubble bursts and the number of infections declines sharply. A typical outbreak chart resembles an inverted “V”. Bubbles follow a similar trajectory. As the ecologist Robert May observed in 2013, “the recent rise in financial assets and the subsequent crash have rather precisely the same shape as the typical rise and fall of cases in an outbreak of measles or other infections.”\nFinancial bubbles and epidemics are both prone to cross borders. In 1720, the genie of speculation jumped from Paris to London, and later spread as far as Portugal and Russia. In the early months of 2020, Covid-19 was carried from Wuhan, China to much of the rest of the world. Bubbles produce unreal times: rumours abound and bizarre promotions are launched. Speculators snapped up shares 300 years ago in a company “for the immediate, expeditious and cleanly manner of emptying necessary houses [toilets] throughout England.” Their descendants have lately taken to stockpiling toilet rolls, a product that England still produces in ample quantity. In an atmosphere of dread, gossip and tall tales spread more virulently than the virus itself.\nBubbles are a form of social contagion. When the markets are soaring, “fear of missing out” drives investors. They lose the capacity to make reasoned judgments. Herd-like behaviour and groupthink prevail. Bullish narratives proliferate. It’s not just that speculators want to hear such stories: Wall Street is incentivised to circulate them. Optimistic visions are maintained in the face of contradictory evidence. During the late 1990s dotcom boom, for instance, Wall Street claimed that internet traffic was doubling every ten weeks. In fact, as researcher Andrew Odlyzko, now at the University of Minnesota, revealed at the time, traffic was growing one-tenth that fast. This inconvenient finding was ignored, and the investment splurge continued, leading to billions of dollars in misallocated capital and the bankruptcy of numerous telecoms firms, including Worldcom.\nThe coronavirus panic has a familiar ring. Charts of reported Italian deaths rising vertically recall bitcoin’s trajectory a couple of years ago. Friends and contacts have taken to forwarding articles by an alarmist coronavirus commentator (not a professional epidemiologist) who boasts millions of readers and claims that his article is the only thing you’ll ever need to read, and will save lives. It’s impossible to say whether this advice is sound or not. But it certainly feels like the pandemic mirror image to the Wall Street pied pipers, such as Henry Blodget, who loudly played their tunes during the internet bubble.\nTrust the experts, we are told: Follow the data and science. If only things were that simple. During the internet and real estate bubbles, financial experts were wrong. A top hedge fund manager once complained to me that “every bubble has an academic shill.” Epidemiology, like finance, is as much art as science. A colleague and I once gathered data on every bubble we could find. Each one turned out to be different. Epidemiologists face the same problem – as they like to joke, “if you’ve seen one pandemic, you’ve seen… one pandemic.”\nBoth investors and epidemiologists face chronic uncertainty. During an epidemic, the data is always changing. Differences in climate and social behavior affect the spread of disease across geographies. This poses enormous challenges when trying to model a pandemic. Like investment strategists, epidemiologists are prone to egregious forecasting errors. In September 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention forecast 1.4 million cases of Ebola in West Africa by the following January. In the end, this epidemic produced fewer than a reported 30,000 cases. An earlier CDC model anticipated a potential smallpox outbreak would result in 77 trillion deaths – as Kucharski says, both models included an unlimited number of susceptible people.\nCovid-19’s true infection rate is unknown, as outside of South Korea testing has been inadequate and no antibody test is yet available. China cannot be trusted to provide accurate data. As for the fatality rate, Italians may be recording deaths due to coronavirus when other illnesses may also be prevalent. Last week Imperial College predicted more than 2 million people would die in the United States and half a million in the United Kingdom if Covid-19 was not suppressed. Imperial’s dire warning persuaded the U.S. and UK governments into draconian action, shuttering large swathes of the economy. On Monday, Boris Johnson locked down Great Britain.\nYet the assumptions in Imperial’s model – the reproduction rate, fatality rate, etc. – are at best educated guesses. The model’s predictions must be hugely sensitive to slight changes in a variety of inputs. Even Imperial admits that what it calls “conservative” assumptions are pessimistic. Such pessimism, or call it excessive caution, appears to be the institutional bias of epidemiologists, just as finance types are prone to hyper-optimism.\nDissenting forces can be heard through the noise. Stanford University epidemiologist John Ioannidis states that analysis of the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship suggests the virus is much less of a danger to life than commonly assumed. Also drawing on the cruise experience, Michael Levitt, the Stanford biophysicist and Nobel laureate, makes a similar point. “What we need to control is the panic,” Levitt told the Los Angeles Times. “We’re going to be fine.”\nThis calls to mind Franklin D. Roosevelt’s words to the American people in his first inaugural address at the depth of the Great Depression in 1933: “The only thing we have to fear is... fear itself – nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.” When the history of this pandemic is written, it may become a postscript to the ever-expanding volume, “Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds”, first published in 1841.\n"}, {"content": "Sensex rises by 227 pts, Nifty back at 12,200.

Bereits eine Woche später identifizierten chinesische Forscher ein neuartiges Virus als Ursache der Krankheitsfälle. Es gehört zur Gruppe der Coronaviren. Wenige Tage darauf veröffentlichte eine Gruppe um den Virologen Christian Drosten von der Berliner Charité den ersten diagnostischen Test für das neue Virus, das Forscher provisorisch 2019-nCoV nennen. Mit dem Test kann das Virus im Labor nachgewiesen werden. Als Quelle des Erregers vermuten die chinesischen Behörden einen Lebensmittelmarkt in Wuhan, auf dem neben Fisch und Meeresfrüchten auch exotische Tiere wie Schlangen verkauft wurden. Der Markt wurde geschlossen und desinfiziert.\nSowohl die Atemwegserkrankungen Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) als auch Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) werden von Coronaviren verursacht, die ihren Ursprung in Tieren haben.

Mit dem Mers-Virus haben sich seit seiner Entdeckung 2012 bis zum Jahresende 2019 etwa 2.500 Menschen angesteckt, jeder Dritte ist daran gestorben. Insgesamt gibt es aber mehrere Hundert Arten von Coronaviren. Viele von ihnen betreffen die Atemwege und können zum Beispiel Erkältungen verursachen.\nIn China sind inzwischen mehrere Tausend Personen erkrankt, einige von ihnen – die meisten wohl mit Vorerkrankungen – sind an einer Lungenentzündung infolge des Virus gestorben. Die ersten Infektionsfälle außerhalb Chinas wurden in Thailand, Japan und Südkorea bekannt. Es handelt sich um Reisende, die vorher in Wuhan gewesen waren. Am 21. Januar meldeten US-Behörden die erste Infektion bei einem Touristen, der aus Wuhan zurückkam, am 24. Januar wurden die ersten Fälle in Frankreich bekannt. Mittlerweile wurden auch erste Fälle in Deutschland bestätigt. Typische Zeichen einer Infektion sind Fieber, Husten und Atembeschwerden. Das Virus kann eine Lungenentzündung verursachen, die tödlich enden kann. Da es sich um eine virale Krankheit handelt, helfen Antibiotika nicht.\nInzwischen ist klar, dass das Virus von Mensch zu Mensch übertragen werden kann. Chinesische Behörden haben mehrere solcher Übertragungen bestätigt, nachdem auch etwa ein Dutzend Fälle bei medizinischem Personal bekannt wurden.

Januar mitteilte, momentan damit, dass ein Infizierter im Schnitt 1,4 bis 2,5 andere Menschen ansteckt. Bewahrheiten sich diese Zahlen, ist das Virus weniger ansteckend als Sars und auch die Virusgrippe. Die WHO empfiehlt generelle Hygieneregeln zu beachten: Man solle sich häufig die Hände waschen und engen Kontakt zu Personen mit Atemwegserkrankungen und wilden Tieren meiden.\nDas lässt sich noch nicht mit Sicherheit sagen. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation teilte am 28. Januar mit, dass ungefähr ein Fünftel der gemeldeten Fälle durch das Virus schwer krank werde, im Zweifelsfall also intensivmedizinisch behandelt werden muss. Berichten zufolge handelte es sich bei den ersten Todesopfern um Patienten, die teils schwere Vorerkrankungen hatten. Auch bei anderen Infektionskrankheiten sind Menschen mit Vorerkrankungen besonders gefährdet – etwa bei der Grippe. Coronaviren sind dafür bekannt, dass sie mutieren, also ihr Erbgut verändern können. Das kann dazu führen, dass sie im Laufe eines Ausbruchs gefährlicher für Menschen werden – aber auch zum genauen Gegenteil. Das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) erwartet zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt keine ähnlich hohe Mortalität wie beim Ausbruch von Sars.\nHat die Regierung die Meldung absichtlich um Stunden\nhinausgezögert, um Entrüstung im Netz zu verhindern? Eine klügere Strategie\nwäre wohl gewesen, ihn als Helden zu vereinnahmen und einzelnen Provinzkadern in\nWuhan die Schuld daran zu geben.\nSo aber ist das Desaster für die Regierung in Peking perfekt: Bereits in den\nvergangenen Wochen war der 34-jährige Augenarzt Li zur Ikone geworden. Am 30.\nDezember 2019 hatte er in einer Chatgruppe vor einem neuartigen Erreger gewarnt.\nDie Polizei suchte ihn nachts zu Hause auf und wies ihn an, zu schweigen. Ende\nJanuar wurde Li dann selbst positiv auf das Coronavirus 2019-nCoV getestet. Seine Frau erwartet\nein zweites Kind. Auch sie hat sich inzwischen angesteckt. Seine Eltern ebenfalls.\nLi ist einer der jüngsten Toten der Epidemie. Die meisten Verstorbenen sind viel älter, hatten meist Vorerkrankungen. Ob es bei Lis Krankheit Komplikationen gab, ist nicht bekannt.\nIn der Trauer über seinen Tod ist die chinesische Gesellschaft\nnun geeint wie seit vielen Jahren nicht. Kaum jemanden lässt sein Schicksal\nunberührt. Li war kein Dissident, kein querulanter Intellektueller oder\nKünstler, kein Uigure im entfernten Xinjiang. Sondern ein junger Augenarzt mit\nSpitzendiplom, Han-Chinese aus der Mittelschicht, gutaussehend noch dazu. Li\nstand nicht abseits der Mainstreamgesellschaft, sondern mittendrin. Li ist der\nideale Märtyrer.\n\"In einer gesunden Gesellschaft sollte es nicht nur eine Art\nvon Stimme geben\" ­– diesen Satz verschickte Li vor einigen Tagen aus seinem\nKrankenhausbett. Er wird nun zum Fanal. Viele Trauernde verbrachten eine\nschlaflose Nacht. #IchwillMeinungsfreiheit war am Freitagmorgen um fünf Uhr der Weibo-Hashtag\nder Stunde. Zwei Millionen Mal wurde er geklickt, bis er verschwand. Um sechs Uhr\nbegann dann #WirwollenPressefreiheit zu trenden, drei Millionen Klicks. Auch\ndieses Hashtag wurde gelöscht.\nDie Welle aus Wut und Trauer in den sozialen Medien ist aber ungebrochen. Aus dem ganzen Land\nposten Menschen Kerzenbilder und Zeichnungen von Li mit Stacheldraht als\nMundschutz – mit Fotos lässt sich die Zensur einfacher umgehen. Ein Kommentator schreibt: \"Lis Tod ist ein Tag der nationalen\nSchande.\" Nachrufe beschreiben Li als Kumpel von nebenan, jemand, der in\nPantoffeln zur Eisdiele ging und Stammgast war bei der beliebten Hotpot-Kette\nHaidilao.\nJeder in China kann sich mit ihm identifizieren. Ein\nAlbtraum für die kommunistische Führung. Denn kaum etwas fürchten Pekings Autokraten so sehr wie den Tod\neines Helden. Anlass dafür gibt die chinesische Geschichte genug: 1913 löste ein\nAttentat auf den Gründer der Kuomintang-Partei eine Revolte gegen den\nStaatspräsidenten aus. 1976 nahmen Menschen den Tod des Premierministers Zhou Enlais zum Anlass, um gegen die Viererbande aufzubegehren, jener Gruppe von Funktionären aus dem linken Flügel der Staatspartei, die schon neben Mao Zedong Macht ausübte. Und 1989 führten\ndas Gedenken an den beliebten Generalsekretär Hu Yaobang zur Studentenbewegung\nvon Tiananmen. Immer wieder wurde die chinesische Trauerfarbe weiß auch zur Farbe von Protesten.\nPeking hat inzwischen auf die Empörung im Netz reagiert: Ein Parteikomittee soll die Fragen der Bevölkerung zum Fall Li Wenliang untersuchen, heißt es. Viele dürfte das nicht besänftigen: \"Erinnere dich an die Wut, die du heute spürst\", lautet ein Appell, der nun viral geht.\nVerfolgen Sie die gesamte Berichterstattung zum Coronavirus auf unserer Themenseite.\n"}, {"content": "La inacción de parte del sureste asiático puede provocar una mayor expansión del coronavirus. El coronavirus de Wuhan (2019-nCov) se expande rápidamente por el sureste asiático. Con más de medio centenar de casos confirmados hasta la fecha, se trata de la región más afectada del mundo. Pero no todos los países del entorno, la mayoría con sistemas sanitarios precarios y muy dependientes del turismo y las inversiones chinas, han reaccionado con premura. La situación en lugares como Tailandia, el país más perjudicado tras la segunda economía mundial con 19 contagios, dispara especialmente las alarmas. Por su parte, Filipinas anunció este domingo la primera muerte fuera de la potencia asiática: un varón chino de 44 años.\n“Aunque los números (de contagios) fuera de China son relativamente bajos, hay potencial para un brote mucho mayor”, advirtió el director general de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, al declarar el jueves la emergencia internacional por la expansión del coronavirus, que a 2 de febrero deja un saldo de 304 muertes y más de 14.000 infectados en todo el mundo. Una decisión en gran parte fundamentada, explicó, en la necesidad de proteger a aquellos países que “no cuentan con los medios para su control”.\nEl sureste asiático es un área clave en este sentido. Pero si bien la declaración de la emergencia implica una coordinación de la respuesta internacional en el marco de la OMS, las posibles nuevas medidas podrían llegar tarde en algunos casos. Tailandia cuenta ya con 19 contagios: uno de ellos es un conductor de taxi tailandés que había desplazado en su vehículo a otros cuatro afectados, todos procedentes de Hubei (provincia de la que es capital Wuhan, el epicentro del virus).\nEl contagio local, también ocurrido en Japón, dispara el mayor temor de las autoridades tailandesas: la aparición de brotes en lugares con gran afluencia de turistas chinos. “Puede empezar con una transmisión a escala local y luego crecer a nivel provincial”, advirtió el subdirector del Departamento de Control de Enfermedades tailandés, Tanarak Plipat. Una posibilidad no muy lejana si se tiene en cuenta que, según informó el jueves dicho departamento, todavía unos 10.000 turistas procedentes de Wuhan están en Tailandia. China fletó el viernes un primer vuelo para repatriarlos.\nTailandia ha recibido un aluvión de críticas ciudadanas por su gestión de la crisis, con el hashtag “crapgovernment” (Gobierno de mierda, en inglés) colándose entre los más populares en Twitter los pasados días. El motivo: el descontento con las medidas tomadas por las autoridades, que hasta mediados de la pasada semana no comenzaron a instalar controles termográficos para todos los vuelos procedentes de China. Para muchos internautas el país habría antepuesto preservar la llegada de turistas chinos a velar por la salud pública. Tailandia, donde el turismo representa entre el 12% y el 20% del PIB, es el primer destino turístico de los chinos en el extranjero. El país calcula pérdidas de entre 2.200 millones y 2.900 millones de euros por la caída del turismo chino.\nAdemás de la mayor o menor capacidad y disposición para poner en marcha medidas de control, otra preocupación es la precariedad de los sistemas sanitarios de muchos países de la región. “No sabemos qué daño puede hacer este virus si se expande en un país con un sistema de salud débil”, remarcó el director general de la OMS. Camboya, uno de los países más pobres del sureste asiático, es un ejemplo claro. Con un caso detectado hasta la fecha, a las insuficiencias sanitarias del país, donde la inversión china ha crecido exponencialmente en los últimos años, se suma otro obstáculo casi más infranqueable: las renuencias de Hun Sen, su primer ministro.\n“Si el primer ministro no lleva mascarilla, por qué la va a llevar el resto”, afirmó esta semana. Hun Sen, quien añadió que la “verdadera enfermedad es el miedo”, descartó cancelar vuelos provenientes de China para no perjudicar la maltrecha economía nacional.\nLa geografía es otro factor de riesgo. Las fronteras terrestres de los países de esta región que lindan con China (Vietnam, con tres contagiados, y Myanmar y Laos, de momento libres del patógeno) continúan abiertas, a diferencia de Rusia, que decretó el jueves su cierre. Indonesia, archipiélago de más de 17.000 islas, mantiene en observación a dos posibles contagiados y asegura haber aumentado los controles en sus incontables puntos de entrada.\nPor su parte, aunque el próspero Singapur ha sido el primer país del sureste asiático en imponer las medidas más drásticas para frenar la propagación del virus, prohibiendo la entrada a todos los viajeros que hayan estado en China en las últimas dos semanas, los casos crecen a diario, llegando a 18 el 2 de febrero. Dos de las contagiadas son mujeres singapurenses que fueron repatriadas desde Wuhan el pasado jueves.\nHasta hace unos días libre del patógeno, Filipinas ha sido el primer país fuera de China en registrar una muerte debido al coronavirus: un ciudadano chino de 44 años que había llegado procedente de Wuhan con su mujer, también infectada. De momento son los dos únicos casos en este país, que horas antes de que se confirmara la muerte anunció la prohibición de todos los viajes desde China continental, Hong Kong y Macao.\nCon China como la principal fuente de turistas para la mayoría del sureste asiático, las restricciones a las entradas de ciudadanos de este país asestan un duro golpe a sus economías. Malasia, donde hay ocho contagiados, ha desestimado una controvertida petición popular de prohibir la entrada a todo ciudadano chino.\nEl turismo se ha convertido pues en un arma de doble filo para el sureste asiático. Aunque se estima que es la principal fuente de contagio, con los chinos viajando hasta diez veces más al extranjero que en 2003, según la consultora Capital Economics —en plena epidemia de SARS, otro coronavirus surgido entonces en China—, la importancia del sector en la región parece desaconsejar la toma de decisiones drásticas.\n"}, {"content": "singapore leaders stand in solidarity with china over covid-19 outbreak. SINGAPORE – Singapore leaders on Monday (Feb 24) said the country stands in solidarity with the Chinese people during the Covid-19 outbreak. \n The coronavirus has killed more than 2,500 people in China and infected more than 75,000. On Sunday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said the outbreak is the country’s largest-ever public health emergency since 1949. \n Singapore President Halimah Yacob and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong sent their condolences to those who lost loved ones during the outbreak.  \n In her letter to Mr Xi, Madam Halimah commended his “swift, decisive and comprehensive measures” to contain the Covid-19 outbreak and safeguard the health of the Chinese people. \n “These measures are beginning to yield encouraging and positive outcomes. I am confident that under your able leadership, China will overcome Covid-19 with strength and fortitude,” Mdm Halimah said. \n Shortly after the outbreak started in Wuhan, the Chinese government moved to contain the spread of the virus, such as shutting down transport links in and out of the city. It also built hospitals in days to treat patients. \n “We have seen how speedily China has mobilised itself to contain the spread, and implemented practical measures to help people affected, both in Wuhan and the rest of China,” Mr Lee wrote in his letter to Mr Xi. \n \"We applaud China’s firm and decisive response, and are happy to see early indications that it is beginning to bring the outbreak under control. \n \"I am confident that with your leadership, and the support of the Chinese people and the international community, China will succeed in this urgent task.\" \n INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION \n During the lockdown, several nations, including Singapore, airlifted its citizens back to their home countries. \n “I would also like to express my appreciation to the Chinese government – in particular the Hubei government – for its facilitation of Singapore’s efforts to repatriate our nationals and their dependents from Hubei,” wrote Mdm Halimah. \n “I am also glad that we were able to assist with the repatriation of Chinese nationals in Singapore back to Wuhan. This is a testament to the strong cooperation between our countries.” \n Mr Lee said China and Singapore \"cooperated closely\" on the repatriation of each other's nationals. \n He said Singapore has been affected by the coronavirus and has introduced restrictions and stepped up detection at its borders. \n \"We have implemented strict quarantine procedures. And we have strengthened our healthcare system, to treat and care for those who have contracted the virus. Many Covid-19 patients, including a significant number of Chinese citizens, have recovered well in our hospitals and been discharged,\" he wrote. \n \"Singapore is cooperating with China on multiple levels. Our shared experience fighting the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) in 2003 taught us that countries have to work with one another to deal with a global public health crisis.\" \n The Prime Minister also noted that while there are similarities between Covid-19 and Sars, there are also \"significant differences\".  \n \"The scientists report that Covid-19 is probably more infectious than Sars, but less lethal. Consequently, it may take longer to bring under control, and is more likely to become endemic in human populations,\" he said. \n MEDICAL SUPPLIES, DONATIONS \n Mdm Halimah added that the Singapore Government has contributed medical equipment, supplies and diagnostic test kits for Covid-19, as well as seed money to a humanitarian fund which has already raised more than S$6 million. \n “I hope that our modest contributions have brought some comfort and relief to those affected by the virus,” she said. \n Mr Lee also noted that Singapore had responded to China's early request for personal protective equipment, medical supplies and diagnostic test kits. \n Mdm Halimah said international cooperation is \"crucial to effectively combatting Covid-19\". \n \"It is to China’s credit that its willingness to work with the international community has allowed us all, including affected countries like Singapore, to develop test kits and come up with appropriate measures to manage the outbreak together,\" she added. \n Mr Lee said Singapore researchers are ready to collaborate with their Chinese counterparts and share their expertise to work towards a vaccine and treatment for the coronavirus. \n \"I am happy that Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat and Vice Premier Han Zheng have agreed to discuss cooperation in the management of public health crises at the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC),\" Mr Lee added. \n Singapore is also cooperating on a regional basis with China and other neighbouring countries to counter the outbreak, as seen in the recent Special Asean-China Foreign Ministers’ Meeting on Covid-19 in Vientiane. \n “Even as countries take strong measures to contain the disease in the early phases, we should begin exploring how over the longer term we can best manage the health effects of the virus on our people, while progressively restoring economic activities and international trade and travel,” said Mr Lee. \n “Singapore has some ideas, which my Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan shared with State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi when they met in Laos last week. Our officials can discuss this further.” \n Singapore and China are marking the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations this year. Mr Lee said the two countries’ close cooperation in meeting common challenges such as Covid-19 testifies to their \"strong and steadfast friendship\". \n “I send my best wishes for your continued success, and look forward to meeting you again soon to discuss these and other issues,” he said. \n Mdm Halimah said: \"I am confident that with your strong support, our two countries will continue to build on this firm foundation to further deepen and broaden the multifaceted cooperation between our two countries.\" CNA \n For more stories like this, visit cna.asia. \n "}, {"content": "struggling hong kong airlines sacks 170 staff, day after it ditches food, drink, blankets and pillows from flights. HONG KONG — Hong Kong Airlines started sacking staff on Wednesday (Feb 19), a day after slashing in-flight services to a bare minimum. \n Sources told the South China Morning Post that 170 employees, mostly flight attendants, had been informed that Wednesday would be their last day of work. \n On Tuesday night, the airline said that, starting the next day, it would cut a host of services on all flights, including providing food, drink, pillows and blankets, in what it said was a “precautionary measure” to protect customers and crew during the coronavirus outbreak. \n However, the Post has been told the move is a desperate attempt to cut costs by an airline which was on the brink of collapse at the beginning of the year, and two weeks ago announced it was making 400 staff redundant. \n The measures came after earlier reductions to services, which only affected flights to mainland China. \n In a notice one employee received, the airline said: “We regret to inform you that based on the company’s recent review of its operational requirements, you will be made redundant.” \n Flight attendants would be paid an extra month, plus accrued but unused annual leave, while severance based on years of service would be taken into account. \n The termination notice ended: “We would like to thank you for your contribution to the company in the past and we sincerely wish you all the best in your future endeavours.” \n Affected staff have been told to hand back their uniforms on Thursday. \n Unable to pay for in-flight entertainment since December, passengers will need to bring their own devices or reading material to keep themselves entertained with magazines scrapped, while the carrier closed its flagship airport lounge at Hong Kong International Airport on Tuesday. \n “To further strengthen our precautionary measures and reduce the risk of our crew and customers from being potentially exposed to coronavirus, Hong Kong Airlines will be limiting in-flight cabin activity and making temporary adjustments to our on-board services,” the company said on its website. \n The airline apologised for the inconvenience to customers and said it would continue to monitor the situation and make further in-flight changes accordingly. The airline’s older lounge in the main terminal of the airport remains open. \n There would be no particular restrictions on passengers bringing food or drink on board, the airline added. \n A fortnight ago, Hong Kong Airlines said at least 400 of its 3,500 staff would be made redundant while all other staff would be required to take unpaid leave between mid-February until the end of June, amounting to a total of two months, or work part-time on half pay. \n Passengers in business class will only receive a bottle of water, while economy travellers will only get a pre-packed cup of water. No food will be provided on flights, and magazines have been axed, except newspapers or reading materials in seat pockets. \n For more than a year, Hong Kong Airlines has faced lingering questions about its ability to keep operating. \n Last December, the government allowed the company to stay in business after a last-minute cash injection — blamed on the months of civil unrest in Hong Kong, during which fewer people visited the city. \n The coronavirus, which causes a deadly disease known as Covid-19, has pushed the airline once again to the brink of its existence.

Lyon are bidding to claim the trophy for the second time.\nLille took the lead in the 12th minute when Sanches fired home from just inside the box but Lyon were level four minutes later with a Dembele penalty after Gabriel Magalhaes handled.\nThe home side thought they had secured victory in the 85th minute when Aouar’s floating strike went past keeper Leo Jardim but Rafael’s poor tackle on Jonathan Bamba earned Lille a stoppage-time penalty that was coolly converted by Remy.\nWith no extra time being played in the League Cup since the 2017 edition, the contest went straight to a penalty shootout in which Lyon converted all of their spot kicks.\nThis is the last season of the League Cup, which was created in 1995 and been won a record eight times by Paris St Germain, after the French league voted to suspend the competition having failed to secure a broadcaster for 2020-2024.\nNapoli alleviated their crisis when an early solo goal by Lorenzo Insigne gave them a 1-0 win over holders Lazio in their Coppa Italia quarter-final on Tuesday, which also featured a bizarre penalty miss by Ciro Immobile for the losers.\nThere were also two red cards in the first half hour and both sides hit the woodwork twice in the second half while Lazio had two goals disallowed as they exited the competition in a remarkable game.\nLazio had won their last six matches in all competitions while Napoli had lost four out of six — including three at home — since Gennaro Gattuso replaced Carlo Ancelotti in December, plunging them into a crisis.\n“We’ve been through an embarrassing period but today the lads have played a great match against the very good team who are Lazio,” said Gattuso.\n“I saw a team with great spirit, you need a lot of intensity to play Lazio... We need to stay hungry and not rest on our laurels,” he added. “We need to keep playing with this hunger and this venom.”\nInsigne gave Napoli a much-needed boost when he collected the ball on the left, skipped past his marker and side-footed a low shot past Thomas Strakosha and into the far corner after two minutes.\nThere was more drama as Lazio won a penalty in the 10th minute after Elseid Hysaj bundled over Felipe Caicedo but Immobile, Serie A’s leading scorer with 23 goals, slipped as he ran up to take the spot kick and scooped the ball harmlessly wide.\nHysaj, who had been booked over the penalty, lunged into Immobile and was given a second yellow card after only 19 minutes. Yet six minutes later, Lazio midfielder Lucas Leiva was booked for a foul, then sent off for protesting the decision.\n“Lucas got the ball and should not have been booked but he is an experienced player and should not have reacted the way he did,” said Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi.\nIt was not Immobile’s night as he had a goal disallowed for offside in the second half and smashed a shot against the crossbar in the 85th minute.\nLazio’s Manuel Lazzari also hit the post with a deflected shot and Francesco Acerbi turned in the rebound but it was ruled out for offside with two minutes left.\nNapoli were also unlucky as Arkadiusz Milik headed against the inside of the post in the 70th minute and Mario Rui curled an effort against the upright.\n“It’s disappointing to lose a match we dominated,” said Inzaghi.\nNext month's women's Olympic football qualifiers in Wuhan have been shifted to Nanjing, the Asian Football Confederation said on Wednesday, following an outbreak of the new coronavirus in the central Chinese city.\nNine people are confirmed to have died and as many as 440 infected from the new SARS-like coronavirus now spreading across China after an outbreak in Wuhan.\n\"The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has agreed to the proposal by the Chinese Football Association (CFA) to move the ...

(Reuters) - Potential damage to business from China’s fast-spreading coronavirus knocked more than 2% off European stocks on Monday, after the world’s second biggest economy ramped up travel bans and extended the Lunar New Year holidays.\nMore than 97% of stocks in the STOXX 600  were trading in the red with many toppling from record highs, wiping out around 180 billion euros of market capitalization from the European share index.\nThe biggest jolt was felt by luxury, airlines and hotel issues, which see big demand from Chinese consumers. Europe’s major luxury players have lost more than $50 billion in market value since the outbreak last week.\n“Markets had been vulnerable to an eventual correction given signs of exuberance such as strong price momentum, high valuations and overweight positioning, but a pandemic is rarely on anyone’s list of negative catalysts,” said John Normand, head of cross-asset fundamental strategy at JPMorgan.\nMeanwhile, safe-haven investment options such as gold and government bonds rose as the death toll from the outbreak in China increased to 81 and the number of cases of infection jumped by about 30% in a day.\nA small number of cases linked to people who traveled from the outbreak’s epicenter have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, including Thailand, France, Japan and the United States. No deaths have been reported elsewhere.\nLed by a steep sell-off in luxury retailers, France's CAC .FCHI lagged all regional bourses falling 2.2%. LVMH (LVMH.PA), Christian Dior (DIOR.PA), Hermes (HRMS.PA) and Gucci owner Kering (PRTP.PA), which are heavily reliant on Chinese demand, fell more than 3%.\nOther companies in the luxury space such as Burberry Group Plc (BRBY.L), Moncler SpA (MONC.MI), Swiss watchmakers Swatch (UHR.S) and Richemont (CFR.S) declined between 2.7% and 4.6% while airport retailer Dufry AG (DUFN.S) was set for its steepest one-day drop in more than a year.\n(GRAPHIC: Luxury stocks - here)\nComparing the new coronavirus with the SARS outbreak in 2002-03, Bernstein analysts highlighted that Chinese nationals accounted for just 2% of the global luxury goods market in 2003 versus a whopping 35% in 2019.\n“Equities are finally beginning to contemplate the possibility that the virus 2019-nCoV (coronavirus) in China will have significant economic impact as the lockdown is now affecting 56 million people,” said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank.\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 volatility index .V2TX, European investors’ ‘fear gauge’, has jumped to its highest level since Dec. 3.\nWith rising travel curbs, flight operators Air France (AIRF.PA), Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and British Airways-owner IAG (ICAG.L), cruise line operator Carnival Corp (CCL.L), hotel group Accor (ACCP.PA) and IHG (IHG.L) took a hit, pushing Europe’s travel & leisure index .SXTP to a near seven-week low.\nThe basic resources .SXPP index eyed its worst day in nearly six months hit by growth fears in China, the world’s top metals consumer.\n"}, {"content": "US: Coronavirus vaccine test opens with 1st doses. US researchers gave the first shot to the first person in a test of an experimental coronavirus vaccine on Monday -- leading off a worldwide hunt for protection even as the pandemic surges.\nWith a careful jab in a healthy volunteer's arm, scientists at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle begin an anxiously awaited first-stage study of a potential Covid-19 vaccine developed in record time after the new virus exploded from China and fanned across the globe.\n\"We're team coronavirus now,\" Kaiser Permanente study leader Dr. Lisa Jackson said on the eve of the experiment. \"Everyone wants to do what they can in this emergency.\"\nThe Associated Press observed as the study's first participant, an operations manager at a small tech company, received the injection inside an exam room. Three others were next in line for a test that will ultimately give 45 volunteers two doses, a month apart.\n\"We all feel so helpless. This is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,\" Jennifer Haller, 43, of Seattle, said as she awaited the shot.\nShe's the mother of two teenagers and \"they think it's cool\" that she's taking part in the study.\nAfter the injection, she left the exam room with a big smile: \"I'm feeling great.\"\nMonday's milestone marked just the beginning of a series of studies in people needed to prove whether the shots are safe and could work. Even if the research goes well, a vaccine wouldn't be available for widespread use for 12 to 18 months, said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the US National Institutes of Health.\nStill, finding a vaccine \"is an urgent public health priority,\" Fauci said in a statement Monday. The new study, \"launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.\"\nThis vaccine candidate, code-named mRNA-1273, was developed by the NIH and Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Moderna Inc. There's no chance participants could get infected from the shots because they don't contain the coronavirus itself.\nIt's not the only potential vaccine in the pipeline. Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine against Covid-19. Another candidate, made by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, is expected to begin its own safety study -- in the US, China and South Korea -- next month.\nThe Seattle experiment got underway days after the World Health Organization declared the new virus outbreak a pandemic because of its rapid global spread, infecting more than 169,000 people and killing more than 6,500.\nCovid-19 has upended the world's social and economic fabric since China first identified the virus in January, with regions shuttering schools and businesses, restricting travel, canceling entertainment and sporting events, and encouraging people to stay away from each other.\nStarting what scientists call a first-in-humans study is a momentous occasion for scientists, but Jackson described her team's mood as \"subdued.\" They've been working round-the-clock readying the research in a part of the US struck early and hard by the virus.\nStill, \"going from not even knowing that this virus was out there ... to have any vaccine\" in testing in about two months is unprecedented, Jackson told The AP.\nSome of the study's carefully chosen healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get higher dosages than others to test how strong the inoculations should be. Scientists will check for any side effects and draw blood samples to test if the vaccine is revving up the immune system, looking for encouraging clues like the NIH earlier found in vaccinated mice.\n\"We don't know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response, or whether it will be safe. That's why we're doing a trial,\" Jackson stressed. \"It's not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population.\"\nMost of the vaccine research under way globally targets a protein aptly named \"spike\" that studs the surface of the new coronavirus and lets it invade human cells. Block that protein and people won't get infected.\nResearchers at the NIH copied the section of the virus' genetic code that contains the instructions for cells to create the spike protein. Moderna encased that \"messenger RNA\" into a vaccine.\nThe idea: The body will become a mini-factory, producing some harmless spike protein. When the immune system spots the foreign protein, it will make antibodies to attack -- and be primed to react quickly if the person later encounters the real virus.\nThat's a much faster way of producing a vaccine than the traditional approach of growing virus in the lab and preparing shots from either killed or weakened versions of it.\nBut because vaccines are given to millions of healthy people, it takes time to test them in large enough numbers to spot an uncommon side effect, cautioned Dr. Nelson Michael of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which is developing a different vaccine candidate.\n\"The science can go very quickly but, first, do no harm, right?\" he told reporters last week.\nThe Seattle research institute is part of a government network of centers that test all kinds of vaccines, and was chosen for the coronavirus vaccine study before Covid-19 began spreading widely in Washington state.\nKaiser Permanente screened dozens of people, looking for those who have no chronic health problems and aren't currently sick. Researchers aren't checking whether would-be volunteers already had a mild case of Covid-19 before deciding if they're eligible. If some did, scientists will be able to tell by the number of antibodies in their pre-vaccination blood test and account for that, Jackson said. Participants will be paid $100 for each clinic visit in the study.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavírus. Finlândia confirma primeiro caso de contágio com o novo coronavírus.

BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - The Chinese province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak reported a record rise in deaths and thousands more infections using a broader definition on Thursday, while Japan became the third place outside mainland China to suffer a fatality.\nThe epidemic has given China’s ruling Communist Party one of its sternest challenges in years, constrained the world’s second largest economy and triggered a purge of provincial bureaucrats.\nWith China’s streets, restaurants and flower markets bare, a miserable Valentine’s Day was expected on Friday.\nJapan confirmed its first coronavirus death - a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo - adding to two previous fatalities in Hong Kong and the Philippines.

But authorities said some elderly people would finally to be allowed to disembark on Friday.\n“Outside the cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship we are not seeing a dramatic increase in transmission outside China,” the WHO’s Ryan said.\nHe added that the main U.N. health agency expected the rest of a special WHO team to arrive in China over the coming weekend to investigative the epicenter of the epidemic.\nU.S. President Donald Trump praised China over its response and said Washington was working closely with Beijing. “I think they’ve handled it professionally, and I think they’re extremely capable,” Trump said in a podcast broadcast on iHeart Radio.\nBut Trump’s top White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, was more critical. “We’re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese, these numbers are jumping around... there was some surprise,” he told reporters.\nIn central China’s Hubei province, officials said 242 people died on Wednesday, the biggest daily rise since the flu-like virus emerged in the provincial capital Wuhan in December.\nTotal deaths in China are 1,367.\nThe rise, following a forecast earlier this week by China’s senior medical adviser that the epidemic might end there by April, halted a global stocks rally. [MKTS/GLOB]\nBut it appeared largely due to the change in methodology.\nHubei had previously only allowed infections to be confirmed by RNA tests, which can take days. RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries genetic information allowing identification of viruses.\nBut it has also begun using CT scans of lungs, the Hubei health commission said, to pinpoint and isolate cases faster.\nAs a result, another 14,840 new cases were reported in the province on Thursday, up from 2,015 new cases nationwide a day earlier. But excluding cases confirmed using the new methods, the number of new cases rose by only 1,508.\nAbout 60,000 people have been infected in total, the vast majority of them in China.\nThe outbreak, believed to have emerged from a Wuhan market where wildlife was traded illegally, has triggered a backlash against local political leaders.\nProvincial Communist Party boss Jiang Chaoliang was fired as secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee, and Ma Guoqiang removed as party chief in Wuhan, state media said.

O Presidente da República Popular da China foi filmado este sábado pela televisão estatal CCTV, numa reunião de emergência com membros de topo do Comité Permanente do Politburo do Partido Comunista, na qual admite que a propagação da epidemia está a “acelerar” e apela aos esforços de todos os níveis do Governo para a combater.\n“Confrontados com a situação grave desta aceleração da propagação da pneumonia, devido a infecções causadas pelo novo coronavírus, temos de reforçar uma liderança centralizada e unida, sob o comando do partido”, afirmou o Presidente, citado pelo New York Times. \n“Os comités do partido e os vários níveis governamentais devem pôr em prática os planos adequados para conter o vírus, de acordo com a orientação do Comité Central”, acrescentou Xi Jinping, antes de lançar uma mensagem de esperança: “Seremos capazes de vencer esta batalha e derrotar a epidemia através de prevenção e controlo”.\nFoi a primeira vez, pelo menos publicamente, que o chefe de Estado chinês falou e se envolveu nos planos de emergência do Governo para travar um surto que já matou 41 pessoas e que já infectou 1300 pessoas – praticamente o dobro dos números oficiais de sexta-feira –, distribuídas por quase todas as províncias e divisões administrativas do vasto território chinês – só o Tibete fica de fora, para já –, e por 12 países.\nEntre os países que detectaram casos de coronavírus, Estados Unidos, Austrália e França sãos representantes de fora do continente asiático, sendo que o Centro Europeu para o Controlo e Prevenção de Doenças admitiu este sábado que é provável que sejam identificados mais casos na União Europeia.\nA aparição de Xi não só atesta a seriedade da situação, como é mais um sinal de alerta do poder central dirigido às autoridades locais, cuja actuação pouco célere na prevenção do vírus já tinha sido criticada através dos meios de comunicação do Estado. \nAs representações locais do Partido Comunista são novamente suspeitas de estarem a encobrir a verdadeira gravidade da crise – já tinham sido no surto de Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave (SARS), que matou perto de 800 pessoas entre 2002 e 2003, – e Pequim tem-se desdobrado em comunicações internas e públicas para forçar os seus dirigentes a não esconderem os números reais de vítimas.\n“Quem colocar a face dos políticos à frente dos interesses do povo será pecador por um milénio.

O número de mortos no país subiu entretanto para os 2.004, depois de as autoridades de saúde terem registado 136 novos óbitos.\nXi Jinping afirmou, numa conversa por telefone com o primeiro-ministro britânico, Boris Johnson, que \"graças a esforços árduos\", existem \"mudanças positivas\" no combate ao surto e \"as medidas de prevenção e controlo da China estão a alcançar progressos visíveis\", de acordo com a agência de notícias oficial Xinhua.\n\"Desde o início do surto, a China deu prioridade à segurança e à saúde do seu povo, recorreu às suas vantagens institucionais e mobilizou todo o país, adotando medidas abrangentes, rigorosas e completas de prevenção e controlo\", defendeu o líder chinês.\nSegundo a agência, Xi agradeceu à rainha Isabel II de Inglaterra e a Johnson pelo apoio dado \"na luta\" da China contra o surto do Covid-19, observando que Londres enviou material médico para a China, o que \"demonstra a amizade entre os dois países e os dois povos\".\nO Presidente chinês agradeceu ainda ao homólogo francês, Emmanuel Macron, o \"apoio prestado pela França\", que demonstra \"plenamente\" a \"profunda amizade\" entre os dois países e o \"alto nível\" da parceria estratégica abrangente entre Pequim e Paris, acrescentou.\nXi Jinping disse que a China \"definitivamente vencerá a batalha\" contra o vírus, devido à \"forte capacidade\" de mobilização e \"experiência\" em lidar com crises de saúde pública.\nEstas declarações tem também um importante cariz político: o surto causou forte descontentamento popular, sobretudo após a morte do médico que alertou, inicialmente, para o novo coronavírus, mas que foi repreendido pela polícia.\nNas primeiras semanas após o início da crise, as referências ao Presidente chinês desapareceram dos meios oficiais e a liderança chinesa passou a assumir uma postura coletiva, com o primeiro-ministro, Li Keqiang, a assumir o grupo de trabalho encarregado de lidar com o surto.\nOs novos casos de infeção ascendem no país aos 1.749, totalizando 74.185, de acordo com o mais recente balanço da Comissão Nacional de Saúde da China.\nOs passageiros do cruzeiro sob quarentena a sul de Tóquio começaram esta quarta-feira a desembarcar, depois de concluído o período de isolamento fixado pelas autoridades para evitar a propagação do novo coronavírus.\nPelas 11h (2h em Lisboa) saíram os primeiros passageiros do navio Diamond Princess, em quarentena desde 3 de fevereiro no porto de Yohokoma, a sul de Tóquio, depois de ter sido detetado pelo menos um caso de infeção com o Covid-19, cujo surto começou no final de 2019 na cidade chinesa de Wuhan.\nAo longo do dia, as autoridades preveem a saída de cerca de 500 passageiros, sempre e quando o resultado das análises realizadas sejam negativos para o coronavírus. A operação de desembarque vai prolongar-se até sexta-feira.\nA bordo do Diamond Princess chegaram 3.711 pessoas, 2.666 passageiros, de meia centena de nacionalidades, e 1.045 tripulantes.\nÀ saída do barco, os primeiros passageiros foram acompanhados por funcionários do Ministério da Saúde japonês, equipados com fatos protetores e máscaras faciais, a táxis e autocarros.\n"}, {"content": "Wuhan virus: 15 Chinese medical workers confirmed infected with coronavirus. WUHAN (XINHUA) - Fifteen medical workers in central Chinese city of Wuhan have been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), with an additional suspected case, the municipal health commission reported early Tuesday (Jan 21) morning. \n One of the 16 patients is in critical condition while the rest are in stable condition. All of them are being treated in isolation, the commission said. \n Medical staff are at the forefront in the prevention and control of the epidemic, the commission said, noting that local hospitals have stepped up efforts to control nosocomial infections, protect medical professionals and strengthened routine monitoring, with suspected cases receiving timely testing and treatment. \n A high-level expert team of China's National Health Commission have confirmed people-to-people transmission of the 2019-nCoV and infections among medical staff. \n As of 6pm on Monday, a total of 224 cases of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV had been reported in China. Of them, 217 had been confirmed, with 14 in Guangdong province, five in Beijing and 198 in Wuhan where the first case was identified with a third death confirmed on Jan 18. \n Wuhan has designated nine hospitals for pneumonia treatment and 61 fever clinics amid an increase in coronavirus-related pneumonia cases. \n "}, {"content": "As China shutdown intensifies, govt plans to rework supply chain. \nIndia could run out of supplies in mobile phones, auto parts, insecticides and pharmaceuticals within a fortnight as the China shutdown intensifies due to coronavirus, according to government officials.\nDescribing the concern as grave, an official pointed out, “we do not have enough time to arrange supplies from other countries”.\nWhile the crisis situation has prompted the government to rework the supply chains, there’s no clear road map yet on how the supply shortfall can be met in the near term at least.\nOfficials have indicated that it’s an opportunity for India to scale up its manufacturing capabilities, but that will take time.\nBesides the shortage in supplies, the government is also fire-fighting on bureaucratic procedures related to imports.\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Saturday that steps were likely to be taken to exempt imports of certain items from documentation, so that consignments from China get cleared fast.\nThe emergency measure is being considered as Chinese officials, caught in tackling the deadly virus, are not able to provide the necessary paperwork for cross-border trade.\n“We are studying the sectors and ports where to provide this relief on a temporary basis,” Sitharaman said, while admitting that she’s worried about the fallout of the virus on the economy.\nAn analysis by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has estimated that China supplies 43 per cent of India’s imports of the top 20 goods.\nThis includes mobile handsets ($7.2-billion import from China), computers ($3 billion), integrated circuits, and other inputs ($7.5 billion), fertilisers ($1.5 billion), pharma ingredient API ($1.4 billion), and antibiotics ($1.1 billion).\nWith over 90 per cent of solar power equipment being sourced from China, 2-4 gigawatts of upcoming projects are likely to be affected, according to CII.\nOfficials believe Customs duty would take a hit in February and March as a direct result of the coronavirus outbreak.\nSources in the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs said they feared that plenty of consignments from China and even Southeast Asia were languishing in ports because of delay in clearances.\n“These are imports for which papers are not arriving from China,” an official said.\nThe importers are also paying demurrage charges at the ports which raise the costs for them. These charges are likely to be waived.\nDemurrage charges are levied by shipping lines on importers when they do not take delivery of the full container and move it out of the port or the terminal area within the permissible number of free days.\nHowever, with China on shutdown mode, many companies are looking at India as an alternative destination.\n“Some 10-12 companies, among those searching for alternatives to China, have spoken to us, and I feel their expectations from us are quite realistic and reasonable,” said Sitharaman.\nThe finance minister is scheduled to meet industry bodies and trade leaders, including those from the tourism sector, about the coronavirus threat on Tuesday.\nShe decided on these interactions after a recent meeting in Chennai, where importers flagged their concerns.\nThe government expects to earn Rs 1.25 trillion from Customs duty in 2019-20, according to Revised Estimates, down 19 per cent from last year’s Budget numbers.\nAjay Sahai, director general and chief executive officer, Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said any relaxation in submission of documents for imports purpose would be highly beneficial as statutory agencies have not yet commenced their full operation.\nMeanwhile, officials from finance, commerce and other ministries are also expected to meet stakeholders to find ways on managing the coronavirus fallout.\nFor instance, Principal Economic Advisor Sanjeev Sanyal said he would hold meetings with industry segments over the next week to strategise on overcoming the supply shortage by scaling up domestic production.\n“We are going to look at ways where we can rework the global supply chain with the help of domestic manufacturers… We are also talking to other countries. It is a big opportunity for us,” Sanyal told Business Standard.\nTo address the supply crunch, CII has suggested leveraging the existing excess capacity in the Indian industry; rolling back import duty hike to look for alternative sources of imports; expanding credit to manufacturing units with quick loan sanctions, and one-time emergency waiver of non-performing asset regulations for three months.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus schockt Finanzmärkte. \nGerade erst war an den Finanzmärkten die Sorge wegen des Coronavirus abgeebbt - doch damit ist es jetzt vorbei. Aktienkurse brachen zum Wochenbeginn ein, die Ölpreise gaben nach. Gefragt waren hingegen Anlagen wie Gold und Staatsanleihen, die als „sicherer Hafen“ in Krisenzeiten gelten. Der Grund für die Turbulenzen: Die Anzahl der Infizierten ist in Italien übers Wochenende deutlich gestiegen, in China ist die Zahl der Toten durch das Virus sprunghaft angestiegen und auch Südkorea ist zunehmend betroffen.\n„Klar ist, dass die wirtschaftlichen Folgen der Corona-Epidemie erheblich sein werden“, kommentierte Michael Bissinger, Experte bei der DZ Bank. Schäden durch Produktionsausfälle, gestörte Lieferketten, eingeschränkte Konsummöglichkeiten und die Ausfälle im Reiseverkehr seien vor allem für China und die asiatischen Anrainerstaaten schon jetzt beträchtlich.\nDer Internationale Währungsfonds (IWF) senkte bereits seine Wachstumsprognose für China und laut Unicredit-Chefvolkswirt Erik Nielsen dürfte die Wirtschaft des Landes im ersten Quartal nur noch um 3 Prozent wachsen, nach rund 6 Prozent Ende 2019. Angesichts der zuletzt stark gestiegenen Bedeutung Chinas für die Weltwirtschaft werde dies entsprechende Auswirkungen auf die globale Konjunktur haben, so der Experte.\nMit Blick auf Deutschland gehen Volkswirte führender deutscher Finanzinstitute davon aus, dass die Epidemie eine Konjunkturerholung verzögern könnte. Denn China ist ein wichtiger Handelspartner Deutschlands. Für die Autobauer BMW, Daimler und Volkswagen ist das Reich der Mitte der wichtigste Einzelmarkt. Hinzu kommen vorübergehende Produktionsstopps, wenn auch BMW und Daimler ihre Fertigung in China inzwischen wieder hochfahren konnten und Volkswagen am Montag bekanntgab, den Betrieb der meisten Werke wieder aufgenommen zu haben.\nBranchen-Experte Ferdinand Dudenhöffer rechnet 2020 im Vergleich zum Vorjahr weltweit mit einem Rückgang der Produktion um 2,7 Millionen Fahrzeuge. Die deutsche Autoindustrie sei wegen des hohen China-Anteils von 35 Prozent am Gesamtumsatz besonders betroffen.\nDer Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) warnt denn auch vor möglichen Auswirkungen des Virus auf die Konjunktur und ruft die Politik zum Handeln auf. „Neben dem Gesundheitsschutz muss die Politik ab sofort das wirtschaftliche Krisenmanagement in den Fokus nehmen“, sagte BDI-Hauptgeschäftsführer Joachim Lang. „Die Bundesregierung muss jetzt schleunigst wirtschaftspolitische Impulse für eine Belebung des Wachstums liefern.“ Die über 5000 deutschen Unternehmen in China seien derzeit in Beschaffung, Produktion und Absatz stark eingeschränkt.\nStockt die Produktion in chinesischen Fabriken länger, weil sie wegen des Virus geschlossen bleiben, geraten auch deren Kunden in Bedrängnis. Apple etwa kassierte wegen des Coronavirus erst jüngst seine Umsatzprognose für das laufende Quartal wegen Lieferengpässen bei iPhones. Am Montag warnte auch der britische Mischkonzern AB Foods vor Auswirkungen auf seine Textilkette Primark. In Deutschland rechnen laut BDI unter anderem die Branchen Elektro, Automobil, Pharma und Papier mit Engpässen bei Lieferungen aus Fernost.\nEin zusätzliches Problem ist laut Experte Nielsen, dass Notenbanken nicht auf solche Angebotsschocks reagieren können. Die Geldhüter können zwar bei einer trägen Nachfrage versuchen, etwa mit Billiggeld die Kauflaune von Unternehmen und Konsumenten anzukurbeln. Gibt es aber schlicht wenig oder nichts zu kaufen, nutzt das nichts.\nWird weniger produziert, muss auch weniger transportiert werden. Das bekommen als erstes Logistikkonzerne und Fluggesellschaften zu spüren. Ihre Aktien zählten neben den Papieren deutscher Autobauer zum Wochenstart zu den größten Verlierern. Für den deutschen Leitindex Dax ging es bis zum Nachmittag insgesamt um knapp vier Prozent abwärts. Auch im Rest Europas sowie in Asien ging es bergab und an den US-Börsen verlor der Dow-Jones-Aktienindex zum Handeslauftakt rund drei Prozent.\nUnter Druck gerieten auch Papiere der Luxusbranche, weil hier ein großer Teil des Umsatzes auf Käufen von Touristen basiert. Die Luxusgüter-Branche rechnet laut einer Studie der Beratungsgesellschaft Boston Consulting Group (BCG) wegen des Coronavirus mit Belastungen bei Umsatz und Gewinn in Milliardenhöhe.\nDie Konjunkturängste drückten auch auf die Ölpreise. Denn werden die Wirtschaftsaktivität und die Reisetätigkeit ausgebremst, fällt das ohnehin schon bestehende Überangebot am Ölmarkt noch größer aus, erklärt Rohstoffexperte Carsten Fritsch von der Commerzbank. Gefragt waren hingegen die als sichere Häfen geltenden Anlagen. Staatsanleihen legten kräftig zu, ihre Renditen fielen im Gegenzug. Der Goldpreis stieg auf ein Siebenjahreshoch, näherte sich der Marke von 1700 US-Dollar je Feinunze (31,1 Gramm) und erreichte in Euro umgerechnet sogar einen Rekord von 1561 Euro.\n"}, {"content": "Africa-Chinese trade raises spectre of coronavirus outbreak across African continent. In Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya and Mauritius, three travellers from China are in isolation awaiting results of the tests. Even though there have been no confirmed cases of novel coronavirus reported so far, the number of people traveling between China and Africa is so high that the authorities do not want to risk the spread of the virus onto their territory.\nOn the small island of Mauritius, five thousand travellers from China visit the country each month - approximately 500 per day. The ministry of health on the island told RFI that six Chinese tourists from Wuhan are currently in quarantine and one is in isolation. All travellers coming to Mauritius from Wuhan city and Hubei province will be quarantined.\nChina-Africa dense traffic\nFor many African states, China is Africa’s main trading partner while students and tourists also travel back and forth. According to Dr John Nkengasong, the director of the African Center for Disease Control and Prevention at the African Union in Addis Ababa, this has increased air traffic between China and Africa.\n“Ethiopia alone counst about six flights that leaves Addis Ababa everyday. Knowing how quickly virus spread across the world, there is no doubt that the continent is at high risk because of the large movement of people between Africa and China,” Nkengasong told RFI.\nLiberia’s Health minister, Wilhelmina Jallah, warned Liberians against travelling to China:\n“We know that a lot of Liberians go back and forth to China. We’re not saying do not go to China but we say if you don’t have to go at this particular time you shouldn’t go.That will be a way of protecting yourself.”\nMeans to fight coronavirus\nSome countries in Africa are better equipped than others to fight the novel coronavirus as they have an efficient early detection system at airports or border controls.\nNkengasong said that fragile states such as Somalia, however, will find it difficult to mount an effective response.\n“Others, like South Sudan, are just emerging from crisis, they will find it challenging to respond [to the coronavirus],” he said. “South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia or Kenya are in a better position to respond to this outbreak than others.”\nCountries like Sierra Leone or Liberia, have had to fight the Ebola epidemic in 2014 and 2015. As a result, they know how to deal with an outbreak.\n“They are more alert”, said Christian Lindmeier a spokesperson for the World Health Organisation in Geneva. “But this coronavirus is different [from the Ebola virus].”\nAccording to Dr Mosoka Fallah, the director of Liberia’s National Public Health Institute, the structures that were built during the Ebola outbreak, five years ago, are currently being used to “prepare for the coronavirus even though they are two different strains”.\n“At our airports, we are checking all people coming from China. We also have a database of everyone who has been in China since December and we are trying to track them down to see how they are doing,” he added.\nLack of communication\nLiberian authorites are in constant communication with the WHO country office and also liaising with ECOWAS to gather information on how the situation is evolving in West Africa.\nWHO has country offices in most African states and they cooperate at a ministerial level to build up the country’s health system.\n“We are always ready to respond to any demand. The emergency committee is giving recommendations on the best protocol to follow and how to protect the medical staff,” said Lindmeier.\nApart from WHO’s technical support, Fallah says Liberia is managing this crisis on its own, with no outside support. The ministry of finance is examining whether a budget needs to be earmarked to meet the needs of the crisis.\nFallah said that Ghana and Sierra Leone are the two entry points in West Africa for travellers from China. But he deplores an absence of communication among West African countries, namely its neighbour Sierra Leone.\n“I’ve sent a couple of communications [to Sierra Leone and Ghana] suggesting to them that they initiate a communication among the countries but I am yet to hear from them,” he told RFI.\nFollow RFI's Zeenat Hansrod on Twitter @zxnt\n"}, {"content": "India faces spike in coronavirus cases, says study, in test for health system. India could face between around 100,000 and 1.3 million confirmed cases of the disease caused by the new coronavirus by mid-May if it continues to spread at its current pace, according to a team of scientists based mainly in the United States.\nThe estimates reinforce concerns among some medical officials and experts in India that the country of 1.4 billion people could see coronavirus cases jump sharply in the coming weeks and put its health system under severe strain.\nThe scientists said projections could change as the country conducts more testing, while also putting in place stricter restrictions and measures to stem the spread of the virus.\nEven with the best case scenarios, probably, you are in a very painful crisis, said Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan who was involved in the study.\nThe study was carried out by the COV-IND-19 Study Group of scholars and scientists looking into the threat posed by the coronavirus, and COVID-19, the disease it causes, in India.\nThe analysis first appeared on Medium, a US publishing platform, on Saturday.\nIndia probably has only around 100,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 40,000 ventilators, said Dhruva Chaudhry, president of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, based on industry estimates and other data.\nWe can handle it if an even number (of cases) come over a period of time, Chaudhry said. But he warned that there was not sufficient infrastructure or staff to handle a sharp spike in critical patients.\nIndia’s federal health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research did not respond to questions about the forecasts.\nSo far, India has reported over 500 cases of the coronavirus and 11 deaths, numbers dwarfed by countries like China, Italy and Spain, but which are nonetheless beginning to accelerate.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday declared a nationwide lockdown for three weeks to tackle the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus.\nThe original study was based on data up to March 16, but following a request from Reuters, the team updated their model using cases from Indian health authorities up to March 21.\nThe model was based on one used by colleagues to analyse the coronavirus outbreak in Hubei, China, and employed a set of equations taking into account the number of susceptible people, those infected and those who recovered.\n"}, {"content": "Covid-19.

Perhaps it’s cabin fever — Singaporeans are getting antsy working from home, frustrated with cancelled holiday plans in the face of tightening travel restrictions. Or mayhap, complacency has set in. The world’s medical community has, after all, touted the Singaporean government’s rigorous measures against the spread of Covid-19 as the gold standard for keeping the disease in check. Whatever it is, our island this past weekend was not the ghost town it resembled a month ago after the Dorscon Orange alert was sounded. It was jam-packed everywhere we went: at a kopitiam in Upper Serangoon, a mom-and-pop bakery in Tiong Bahru, a chic new restaurant on Purvis Street, a Chinese fine-diner in Orchard Road, a Yakun outlet in Ion Orchard, and the food basement at Takashimaya. All were thronged with people as if it were 2019 during the Great Singapore Sale, back when we weren’t in the thick of, you know, a pandemic.  \n The government has advised Singaporeans to practise social distancing. What is social distancing, you ask? The idea is to maintain a distance between you and other people — in this case, at least six feet (about two metres). That also means minimising contact with people, says The New York Times. This is important as there is no vaccine for Covid-19 yet, and social distancing is the only thing that works in lessening the spread of the disease now. China’s drastic drop in new cases within the virus’s epicenter in Wuhan is proof enough that this method has its merits.  \n “I think when you are dealing with an epidemic of a new virus, you are never complacent about it. For both China and Singapore, we may have handled the first phase reasonably well, but we will not be complacent. You should not sound the all-clear,” warns Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan in an interview with CNBC. Sage advice, especially when our neighbour, Malaysia, announced last night that it will enforce a “restricted movement order”, which bans citizens from going overseas and foreigners from entering the country for roughly two weeks starting 18 March. The lockdown is in response to a sharp spike of cases in Malaysia. Meanwhile, the disease has brought Europe to its knees, with Italy having an alarming number of deaths that are already half of China’s total. American cities like New York have shut down schools, theatres, bars and even restaurants. Some speculate that the virus may soon blow up in the rest of South East Asia, where a lot of testing is done haphazardly at best — our country has seen a few imported cases from Indonesia, and it has since imposed restrictions on medical tourists trying to seek treatment here.  \n Singaporeans know all of this. Yet, this was what we witnessed last weekend.Photo: This is Hunan/Facebook \n This scene greeted us at old-school bakery Tiong Bahru Galicier Pastry: a line of 15 people in its cramped premises, standing mere inches away from each other. Perhaps unwisely, we pressed on as we promised to buy its yummy white coconut kueh dadar, ondeh ondeh and kueh puteri ayu for our parents. With health experts’ advice to maintain a two-metre (some say four) gap between strangers ringing in our head, we pointedly gave a wide berth between ourselves and the lady in front. Our efforts were soon scuppered when an auntie rushed up behind us, invading our personal space like a nosy mother who flings open her teenage son’s bedroom door at midnight without knocking. We stepped away in an attempt to put some distance between us. She inched closer. We strode ahead again and she shadowed us once more like a bad movie sequel. Rinse and miserably repeat. “Hey auntie, do you mind not standing so close please?” we finally blurted, not caring if we sounded like a paranoid germophobe (we’d rather be safe than sorry). To her credit, she backtracked quickly, darting her eyes nervously around. We relaxed a little. Soon, it was our turn to order at the cake counter. As we fumbled for cash, we felt someone with clammy skin brushing up against us. Hello again, auntie. In her haste, she probably thought skin-to-skin contact would result in faster service. We damn near sprinted out of the shop. “You should’ve faked a coughing fit, everyone in the queue would’ve definitely steered clear,” jokes a friend after we related this harrowing tale.  \n   \n  \n The retro bakery is famous for its yummy white coconut kueh dadar. \n 8days.sg reader A. Wong told us after seeing our Insta story: “That’s not the worst. I was queuing to pay for (uncovered) breads on a tray at BreadTalk when the lady in front of me turned back and coughed. It was my turn next and so the cashier rung up my order. The lady who coughed wasn’t masked — I was shocked. Coincidentally, she did not ‘infect’ her purchases but instead aimed her cough behind her [at me] — no social responsibility. I later binned the bread for peace of mind. My family and friends told me I shouldn't have paid for it and should have gotten new ones, but everything took place in a short span of time and in hindsight, it might have been for the best so that the possibly germy bread wouldn’t make its way back to the shelf.” How ghastly. Pictured: a line with zero social distancing at Donq bakery in Takashimaya. \n   \n A Korean banchan store in Takashimaya’s food basement teemed with customers — both locals and tourists — clamouring for samples last weekend. As we waited to be served, we felt an unholy gust of wind against the back of our neck. As we swivelled to find its source, a middle-aged guy with his mug several inches from ours bellowed in Mandarin: “I want spicy anchovies!” We recoiled in horror and glared at him. He jerked back almost comically, embarrassed realisation creeping up on his face as he acknowledged he did a totally uncool thing in the time of Covid-19. The irony? He was wearing a surgical mask — but it was pulled down to reveal his nose and mouth. It stared at us mockingly from the depths of his chin. As if our nerves weren't already frayed enough, the shop assistant then coughed very lightly as she scooped up our anchovies. She may have done this through a mask, but it looked rather flimsy. We get that she couldn't cover her mouth because her hands were busy scooping up our food and that her throat probably tickled so uncontrollably she couldn't help herself — but perhaps turn the other way? Needless to say, we changed our mind about wanting those little fish after all. On a brighter note, the sour & spicy kimchi that we finally tapowed home was pretty appetising.  \n Even upmarket cafes like Bacha Coffee in Ion Orchard, which is like a glittering java version of TWG’s swish teahouses, didn’t have a single empty seat last Sunday afternoon. There was a mid-length but tightly-packed line of people waiting to enter the busy dining room. \n   \n   \n Why do some restaurants still do this when every single thing you put into your mouth is met with suspicion these days? It’s gross even pre-Covid-19, quite irresponsible now. At the two trendy new restaurants we visited last week, we asked for serving spoons for communal dishes. Both times, the waiters simply left the cutlery resting on our bare table. One of them also used a musty-smelling cloth to wipe said table just minutes earlier. Ideally, eateries should place silverware onto plates, wrap them up in napkins, or only provide them directly to the diner when their food is served.  \n   \n Go out if you must — small F&B businesses in particular need your love during this difficult period. But do so wisely: avoid overcrowded places, maintain a safe distance from strangers where possible, keep your person to yourself (no brushing up against people, please). And for the love of all things that are good, cover your mouth when you cough and wash your hands immediately after. Do your part to help flatten the curve and protect not just yourself, but loved ones who’re vulnerable to the virus. Can’t or won’t do it? Then it’s far safer to endure cabin fever at home instead of being struck down with one of the viral kind. Photos: Florence Fong \n "}, {"content": "Athletes unite to fight common rival. DUBLIN • Conor McGregor, the biggest draw in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, has spent €1 million (S$1.58 million) on protective equipment for hospital staff members treating patients infected by the coronavirus in Ireland. \n The mixed martial arts star sent a message to Ireland's Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, and revealed the contents on his Twitter page on Wednesday night. \n Donohoe had written to his fellow Irishman, asking him to tell his 7.9 million social media followers to practise social distancing. \n \"Today I am purchasing myself, one million euros worth of personal protective equipment to be deployed to all the fighting hospitals in the Leinster region. Our most affected region, to this date,\" McGregor said. \n \"St James', Mater, Tallaght, Beaumont, Vincent's (hospitals). Where we would be without these brave men and women, I do not know. May God bless over them and keep them safe.\" \n He also called on the Irish government to go \"all the way\" in its efforts to fight Covid-19 and implement even more stringent lockdown measures. \n McGregor is, however, not the only high-profile sporting figure to contribute generously to the efforts in combating the contagion. \n On Wednesday, 20-time Grand Slam winner Roger Federer and his wife, Mirka, said they had donated 1 million Swiss francs (S$1.48 million) \"for the most vulnerable families\" in Switzerland, which has over 11,000 confirmed cases and a death toll of 164 as of yesterday. \n Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola on Wednesday made a €1 million contribution to a campaign launched by the Angel Soler Daniel Foundation and Medical College of Barcelona. Spain is the second-most affected country in Europe after Italy, with over 56,000 cases and 4,089 deaths. \n While the epicentre of the outbreak has shifted from China to Europe, Wuhan was where the disease originated. Last month, retired Chinese tennis star Li Na, the only Asian player to win two Grand Slam singles titles, donated 3 million yuan (S$608,500) to support the efforts in suppressing Covid-19 in her hometown. \n The Poland striker has given €1 million to a campaign called \"We Kick Corona\", which was set up by Bayern Munich teammates Leon Goretzka and Joshua Kimmich. It aims to assist frontline healthcare workers to limit the spread of the virus in Germany, which has been badly affected, with almost 40,000 cases and 222 deaths. \n The Tottenham forward is back in London after undergoing surgery for a broken arm, which he suffered last month.

In der Stadt, in der das neuartige Coronavirus vermutlich auf einem Tiermarkt ausgebrochen war, leben rund elf Millionen Menschen.\nZudem wurden die Menschen aufgefordert, nur noch mit Schutzmasken in die Öffentlichkeit zu gehen. Wer in Hotels, Restaurants, Einkaufszentren oder Parks keine Maske trage, werde bestraft, berichtete die Zeitung „China Daily“. Wuhan ist von der Krankheit besonders schwer betroffen. Das Virus hat sich aber mittlerweile in großen Teilen Chinas und auch über die Landesgrenzen hinaus verbreitet. Die Krankheit war bereits in Japan, Südkorea, Taiwan, Thailand und den USA nachgewiesen worden.\nWeil immer mehr Menschen mit Grippesymptomen auf das neue Virus getestet werden, nimmt die Zahl der bestätigten Fälle weiter zu. Bis Donnerstag wurde das Virus bei 571 Menschen nachgewiesen, wie die chinesische Gesundheitsbehörde berichtete.

The meeting, however, warned that the risks for sporadic infections and localised outbreaks have not gone away.

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday opened the door to a radical shift in the U.S. government's relationship to private industry as the coronavirus outbreak upends the nation's economy, saying he would back the government taking stakes in certain companies.  \n Asked if he supported the federal government moving to take an equity stake in some companies, Trump said: \"I do. I really do.\"  \n Trump, speaking at a news conference at the White House, added: \"We will be helping the airline industry. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry.\"  \n The White House did not immediately respond when asked if purchasing shares in battered companies was really under consideration. The U.S. government rarely invests in public companies except in the case of bailouts to save ailing firms and jobs.  \n The COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which originated in China late last year, has sickened more than 11,000 people in the United States and killed more than 180, upending American life as it shutters schools, restaurants and businesses across the country.  \n Bailout requests related to the spread of health crisis, in the form of direct grants, loans, loan guarantees and tax relief, have topped $2 trillion. Companies generally do not welcome government ownership for fear they would lose control of their business, however.  \n  \n PRECEDENT  \n Taking stakes in companies is not without precedent in times of crisis.  \n The Bush and Obama administrations loaned the auto industry, including General Motors and Chrysler, which is now controlled by Italy’s Fiat, $80 billion to avoid the collapse of the industry that they felt would result in the loss of millions of U.S. jobs.  \n The U.S. government spent about $50 billion to bail out GM alone. As a result of the company’s 2009 bankruptcy, the government’s investment was converted to a 61 percent equity stake in the Detroit-based automaker, plus preferred shares and a loan. The government no longer has a stake in the company.  \n Just last month, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the United States and its allies should consider taking a \"controlling stake\" in Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson to counter China-based Huawei’s dominance in next-generation 5G wireless technology.  \n The Trump administration accuses Huawei of being able to spy on customers and has led a global campaign to convince allies to keep the blacklisted company out of their 5G networks.  \n Even if the idea of ownership stakes is ultimately discarded, sweeping measures to mitigate the economic fallout from coronavirus seem inevitable.  \n Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday urged Congress to pass a $1 trillion economic relief measure by early next week, adding the government was focused on being able to provide liquidity to companies.  \n Asked if a trillion dollar stimulus is enough, Trump said: \"We will know about that later. We'll see what happens. It depends how long, so much depend on what's going on in this room, in terms of the medical. If we can stop it in its track the virus, it's plenty.

On Monday, stocks in the world's second largest economy got mauled when re-opening after an extended Lunar New Year holiday with China's blue-chip index <.CSI300> tumbling nearly 8% and the Shanghai Composite losing $420 billion of its value. China's central bank said on Monday it will inject 1.2 trillion yuan ($174 billion) worth of liquidity into the markets via reverse repo operations. Eyes will be on policy makers to see what monetary - or other - support they might stump up.  \n The virus's progression has been likened to a schlock science fiction movie, replete with conspiracy theories around symptomless transmission and super-spreaders. Some 60 million people at the center of the outbreak are living under virtual lockdown. A shock to China's economy this quarter, which then reverberates through global supply chains, is a foregone conclusion. It's just that no one can yet say how deep.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: China's GDP and markets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6912/6843/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n  \n 2/THE VIRUS AND THE WORLD  \n The coronavirus' repercussions are being felt far and wide, well beyond its starting point in China's Hubei province. Countries reliant on Chinese demand have seen steep drops in their currencies, with the Australian dollar down around 5% in January, its worst month since 2016. The Thai and Korean currencies, exposed to China via tourism and goods exports respectively, are also taking a battering.  \n Growth forecast downgrades for China, the world's No. 2 economy, are coming thick and fast, meaning estimates for other countries are being reworked too. Tellingly, 'Dr' Copper, the best-known gauge of economic health, is down 10% in little more than a week, and oil suffered a fourth week of losses. World stocks have lost $1.2 trillion over the past two weeks and have come under fresh pressure again at the start of the week. Depending on how the virus spreads from now, there could be more pain to come.  \n Selling may focus in particular on travel and leisure, with a European index of these sectors skidding to the lowest since October last week. The beneficiaries? The usual safe-haven plays: gold, for instance, has enjoyed its best month in five.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Airline and hotel stocks slide on Coronavirus outbreak - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1644/1619/stocks.png)  \n  \n 3/ARE EURO ZONE BANKS TURNING A CORNER?  \n Blowout performances by Wall Street banks, and bumper Q4 earnings from the Spanish lender Santander, have fed hopes of a strong season for euro zone banks, a raft of which will post results in coming days. How heavyweights such as BNP Paribas, Intesa and ING fared in the last quarter of 2019 will shed more light on how they are riding the wave of negative rates.  \n Troubled Deutsche Bank reported a major loss due to one-offs, but shares rose nonetheless as investors turned their focus on the bank's turnaround potential. With higher interest rates still far off, banks are finding it challenging to grow. But after 20 straight months of downgrades, earnings estimates have started to stabilize.  \n The coronavirus scare, however, threatens to strangle Europe's economic recovery and therefore any banking revival. An index of bank shares has fallen more than 5% so far this year, underperforming the broader euro benchmark.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Banks' earnings - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1604/1579/Bank%20earnings%20revisions.png)  \n  \n 4/ WORK AND PAY  \n Friday's non-farm payroll data will show how the U.S. economy fared in the first month of the new decade. The report is expected to show a pickup from December, with a Reuters poll forecasting 156,000 were added, from 145,000 the month before. The previous decade hit a number of milestones. December's report was the 111th monthly scorecard in a row to show employment gains, while the 3.5% unemployment rate matched a low from half a century ago and is roughly a third of the level at the start of the decade. Worries of a trade-war-induced slowdown have faded since the Federal Reserve delivered three rate cuts in 2019. Recent data has largely shown the U.S. economy continuing to expand at a moderate pace, and the Fed has signaled that its monetary policy stance is unlikely to change this year.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: U.S. Unemployment vs S&P index - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1610/1585/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 5/RETURN OF VOLMAGEDDON  \n When a slight U.S. inflation uptick pushed stock markets lower on Feb. 5 two years ago, few expected it to turn into one of the biggest Wall Street shake-ups in recent years. That episode -- \"Volmageddon\" -- saw the VIX equity volatility gauge triple overnight to 50%, wiping out hordes of small punters who had piled into so-called inverse-vol investments.  \n These strategies, peddled via exchange-traded products and designed to profit from extended spells of market calm, yielded rich pickings as long as volatility stayed low. But as the VIX exploded higher, vehicles such as the ProShares Short VIX ETF tumbled over 80 percent in a day.  \n As we were reminded two years ago, volatility can spike spectacularly in quiet markets. As it happens, the coronavirus has sent the VIX to three-month highs and ProShares ETF, which had climbed back to the highest level reached since Volmageddon, has fallen again. But volatility gauges for bonds and currencies remain well below historic averages.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said on Wednesday that the United States would have to be tolerant if the fast-spreading coronavirus impaired China’s ability to increase purchases of American farm products under the countries’ recently signed trade deal.\nChina, in the initial deal signed Jan. 15, promised to buy at least an additional $12.5 billion worth of U.S. farm products in 2020 and at least $19.5 billion in 2021 over the 2017 level of $24 billion.\nCommodity traders and agricultural economists have questioned whether Beijing will follow through on pledges in the deal to buy $36.5 billion of U.S. agricultural goods in 2020, now that the new coronavirus is threatening China’s economic growth.\n“If they’re really trying and it really just blows the economy out of the water, then we would have to be understanding of that,” Perdue said, speaking to reporters at a cattle convention in Texas.\nPerdue noted he is not part of the government team tasked with enforcing the terms of the deal. He did not say how the United States would need to adjust its expectations.\nThe United States wants China to live up to its pledges, Perdue said, but trade negotiators could not have anticipated the outbreak.\n“There are force majeure type of things ... that I think you have to be sensitive to,” Perdue said.\nThe deal text contains a disaster clause, yet to be formally invoked by Beijing, to allow for delays: “In the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event outside the control of the Parties delays a Party from timely complying with its obligations under this Agreement, the Parties shall consult with each other.”\nChina has reported that more than 500 people have died in the outbreak, most in and around the locked-down central city of Wuhan, where the new virus emerged late last year.\nChina’s ability to meet its purchase target was in doubt even before coronavirus outbreak, because rival soybean supplier Brazil is harvesting a massive crop, and a deadly pig disease is reducing Chinese demand for soy used to feed livestock.\n“If you will, the coronavirus has given China a get-out-of-jail card on their obligations,” said Bill Lapp, economist and president of Nebraska-based Advanced Economic Solutions.\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday the epidemic would delay a surge in U.S. exports to China expected from the trade deal.\n"}, {"content": "China confirms 1st death outside epicenter of coronavirus outbreak. China moved to lock down at least three cities with a combined population of more than 18 million in an unprecedented effort to contain the deadly new virus that has sickened hundreds of people and spread to other parts of the world during the busy Lunar New Year holiday.\nThe open-ended lockdowns are unmatched in size, embracing more people than New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago put together.\nThe train station and airport in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, were shut down, and ferry, subway and bus service was halted. Normally bustling streets, shopping malls, restaurants and other public spaces in the city of 11 million were eerily quiet. Police checked all incoming vehicles but did not close off the roads.\nSimilar measures were being imposed on Friday in the nearby cities of Huanggang and Ezhou. In Huanggang, theaters, internet cafes and other entertainment centers were also ordered closed.\nIn the capital, Beijing, major events were canceled indefinitely, including traditional temple fairs that are a staple of holiday celebrations, to stop the spread of the virus.\nThe Forbidden City, the palace complex in Beijing that is now a museum, announced it will close indefinitely on Saturday.\nChina's National Health Commission said on Friday morning the confirmed cases of the new coronavirus had risen to 830 with 25 deaths.\nThe first death was also confirmed outside the central province of Hubei, where the capital, Wuhan, has been the epicenter of the outbreak.\nThe health commission in Hebei, a northern province bordering Beijing, said an 80-year-old man died after returning from a two-month stay in Wuhan to see relatives.\nThe vast majority of cases have been in and around Wuhan or people with connections the city. Other cases have been confirmed in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand. Singapore and Vietnam reported their first cases Thursday, and cases have also been confirmed in the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macao.\nMany countries are screening travelers from China for symptoms of the virus, which can cause fever, coughing, breathing difficulties and pneumonia.\nThe World Health Organization has decided against declaring the outbreak a global emergency, a step that can bring more money and resources to fight a threat but that can also cause trade and travel restrictions and other economic damage, making the decision a politically fraught one.\nThe decision \"should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious or that we're not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth,\" WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said. \"WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.\"\nChinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns of the cities will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China's Communist Party-led government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people's liberties. And the effectiveness of such measures is unclear.\n\"To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,\" said Gauden Galea, the WHO?s representative in China. \"It has not been tried before as a public health measure. We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.\"\nJonathan Ball, a professor of virology at molecular virology at the University of Nottingham in Britain, said the lockdowns appear to be justified scientifically.\n\"Until there's a better understanding of what the situation is, I think it's not an unreasonable thing to do,\" he said. \"Anything that limits people's travels during an outbreak would obviously work.\"\nBut Ball cautioned that any such quarantine should be strictly time-limited. He added: \"You have to make sure you communicate effectively about why this is being done. Otherwise you will lose the goodwill of the people.\"\nDuring the devastating West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014, Sierra Leone imposed a national three-day quarantine as health workers went door to door, searching for hidden cases. Burial teams collecting corpses and people taking the sick to Ebola centers were the only ones allowed to move freely. Frustrated residents complained of food shortages.\nIn China, the illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub. Local authorities demanded all residents wear masks in public places and urged civil servants wear them at work.\nAfter the city was closed off Thursday, images showed long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets, as people stocked up. Trucks carrying supplies into the city are not being restricted, although many Chinese recall shortages in the years before the country's recent economic boom.\nAnalysts predicted cases will continue to multiply, although the jump in numbers is also attributable in part to increased monitoring.\n\"Even if (cases) are in the thousands, this would not surprise us,\" the WHO's Galea said, adding, however, that the number of infected is not an indicator of the outbreak's severity so long as the death rate remains low.\nThe coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which is thought to have originated from camels.\nChina is keen to avoid repeating mistakes with its handling of SARS. For months, even after the illness had spread around the world, China parked patients in hotels and drove them around in ambulances to conceal the true number of cases and avoid WHO experts. This time, China has been credited with sharing information rapidly, and President Xi Jinping has emphasized that as a priority.\nHealth authorities are taking extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of the virus, placing those believed infected in plastic tubes and wheeled boxes, with air passed through filters.\nThe first cases in the Wuhan outbreak were connected to people who worked at or visited a seafood market, now closed for an investigation. Experts suspect that the virus was first transmitted from wild animals but that it may also be mutating.

OMS preocupada com chegada a África do surto que voltou a matar médico na China. Um médico de 29 anos morreu esta quinta-feira em Wuhan, a cidade na província chinesa de Hubei onde o surto de coronavírus foi inicialmente detetado e que continua a ser a região mais contaminada. O caso não é igual aos outros porque Peng Yinhua, especialista em doenças respiratórias, foi infetado enquanto trabalhava na linha da frente do combate ao coronavírus.\nÉ o segundo caso do género: há um mês foi Li Wenliang, outro jovem médico, de 34 anos. O caso de Li ganhou expressão internacional quando se soube que as autoridades chinesas o repreenderam por ter avisado os colegas da faculdade médica que frequentava de que o coronavírus era um surto. Antes de o próprio Governo o fazer. Agora é Peng a saltar para o topo das notícias por se ter sabido que adiou o seu casamento para continuar a tratar pacientes contaminados.\nA notícia da morte surge ainda num momento delicado para o governo chinês, que atualizou o número de infetados: são mais 1109 casos, que contribuem para um total acima de 74 mil, só na China continental. As mortes a registar também aumentaram, para 2236. E a preocupação surge de onde nem sempre se espera. Nas prisões, há já 500 casos confirmados pelo país. E aqui, como em todas as outras estatísticas, Hubei continua a ser a região mais crítica, com 271 desse total de doentes. A maioria mulheres.\nA cerca de 1500 quilómetros, na Coreia do Sul, as notícias não são melhores. Em três dias, o número de infetados triplicou, tornando o país o segundo mais afetado pela epidemia, fora a China. São agora 156 casos, enquanto no Japão o número se mantém em 94, se descontarmos os do navio de cruzeiro Diamond Princess. A situação coreana terá tido origem numa mulher de 61 anos com sintomas de pneumonia, que esteve em visita a uma igreja em Daegu, cidade com mais de dois milhões de habitantes e que fica a apenas duas horas da capital, Seul. A mulher é agora conhecida por “paciente 31” e as autoridades do país avisaram que os encontros religiosos são “eventos de super propagação”. Não estão proibidos, mas desaconselhados, ao contrário de grandes ajuntamentos de pessoas, que foram mesmo banidos.\nBibliotecas, escolas e infantários estão fechados em Daegu. Após uma série de testes positivos a pessoal militar, também os soldados estão proibidos de abandonar os quartéis. O primeiro-ministro coreano, Chung Se-kyun, admite que o país vai entrar numa segunda fase do combate ao coronavírus: a “fase de emergência”.\nO aeroporto internacional do Cairo, capital do Egito, tem segurança reforçada, após a deteção de um caso de coronavírus no país\nSTR\nAo fim de praticamente três meses, há que adicionar uma nova geografia ao surto. O primeiro doente infetado no continente africano está no Egito, não muito longe do Irão, já na Ásia, onde duas pessoas morreram esta semana por causa do Covid-19.\nPara a Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS) o caso africano é especialmente preocupante por se tratar de um continente que inclui países com sistemas de saúde precários e planos de contingência antiquados. Em conferência de imprensa, o diretor-geral da OMS, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, afirmou que a organização está a “associar-se aos CDC (Centros de Prevenção e Controlo de Doença) de África para coordenar esforços e preparar uma possível chegada do vírus”. “Acreditamos que lá o vírus pode ser um grave perigo, por isso estamos a centrar-nos nos lugares onde os sistemas de saúde são mais frágeis”, completou.\nEsses lugares estão em países como a Nigéria, Gana, Etiópia, Sudão, Quénia, Tanzânia ou Angola, que, no entanto, não são os países com maior risco de contaminação. Apesar da proximidade de alguns às fronteiras asiáticas, o risco é considerado “moderado” por um estudo publicado na revista “The Lancet”, que põe o desafio no Egito, na Argélia e na África do Sul. O paradoxo é que esses são exatamente os países com maior capacidade de resposta, segundo a mesma fonte.\nVittoria Colizza, investigadora da universidade francesa Sorbonne, responsável pelo estudo, conta que “os países africanos reforçaram recentemente a preparação para lidar com casos importados do Covid-19, incluindo vigilância em aeroportos, controlo de temperatura nas fronteiras, recomendações para evitar viagens à China e o aprimoramento das informações de saúde fornecidas aos profissionais do setor e do público em geral”.

No death was reported outside the republic.World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the 2019-nCoV situation as a PHEIC at a press conference in Geneva on Thursday, saying that the greatest concern now is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.Malaysia, which has also recorded eight imported cases of infection caused by the 2019-nCoV involving Chinese nationals, has also taken various proactive measures to prevent the spread of the virus which causes pneumonia and symptoms such as fever, cough and breathing difficulties, in the country.“Malaysia welcomes the (WHO’s) declaration and has been on high alert and strengthening the surveillance in all of our international entry points even before the PHEIC was announced,” Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said.As at noon today, the number of confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV in Malaysia remained at eight, while the cumulative number of patients under investigation (PUI) for coronavirus infection is 142, with six awaiting laboratory test results.The number of individuals who have had close contact with coronavirus positive cases remains at 32, he said, adding that the patient who was reported to have fled from hospital while waiting for laboratory test results, had been picked up and confirmed negative for 2019-nCoV.Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad in a statement today also said that Malaysia is leading the ASEAN Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) network and actively engaging with the ASEAN member states on 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation updates and data sharing to promote detection response and communication to prevent the spread of the virus.“We (Malaysia) are on top and in control of all these things,” he stressed.Four of the eight Chinese nationals tested positive for 2019-nCoV in Malaysia are receiving treatment at Sungai Buloh Hospital, three at Permai Hospital in Johor, and one in Sultanah Maliha Hospital in Langkawi. All of them are reported stable and recovering well.The government’s proactive action in tackling the health issue also involved the evacuation of Malaysian citizens from Wuhan.According to Malaysian Ambassador to China, Raja Datuk Nushirwan Zainal Abidin, discussions with China regarding the evacuation of Malaysians were going well and those involved were expected to return on commercial flights soon.He said the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing had also sent an advance team to Wuhan to coordinate and assist in the process of bringing back 120 Malaysians in Hubei province.“The team will locate and update the list of Malaysians there for the purpose of repatriation later,” he said.The government’s quick action in preventing the spread of the coronavirus infection in the country had also received praise from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah.His Majesty said the government, however, has to continuously undertake precautionary measures, not compromising on issues affecting the well-being of the people and the country.Al-Sultan Abdullah also reminded the people to cooperate with the government in implementing preventive measures to stop the coronavirus from spreading further.-- BERNAMA"}, {"content": "Novel coronavirus named 'Covid-19': UN health agency.

HONG KONG — A 65-year-old Chinese woman who fell seriously ill after being infected with the coronavirus made a startling recovery after being given stem cell therapy, according to a new study by Chinese scientists. \n The patient had been fighting for her life in the intensive care unit at Baoshan Hospital in Kunming, the capital of southwest China's Yunnan province, for nearly two weeks after contracting Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. \n But according to a paper published by a team of researchers from Kunming University led by Dr Hu Min, just four days after being given her first shot of umbilical cord stem cells, the woman was back on her feet and able to walk. \n \"Although only one case was shown here, it could be very important and inspire similar clinical practices in treating critically ill Covid-19 patients,\" said the study, which was published on Thursday (Feb 27) on Chinaxiv.org, a platform for the release of scientific papers that have yet to be peer-reviewed. \n The treatment \"might be an ideal choice to be used or combined with other immune modulating agents\", it said. \n The Yunnan case is one of 14 trials using stem cells to treat coronavirus patients in China, according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) clinical trial database. While the technology remains controversial, there is hope among health authorities and medical professionals that it could become a lifesaver for critically ill patients. \n The patient in Kunming arrived in the city on Jan 21 on a flight from Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei province and the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. A week later she fell ill with a mild fever, fatigue and coughing, so went to a public hospital where she tested positive for Covid-19. From there she was transferred to Baoshan Hospital. \n Following the strict guidelines laid down by the government for the treatment of coronavirus patients, doctors there first administered antiviral medications and antibiotics, and put the woman — who also suffers from type 2 diabetes — on oxygen to help her breathe. Her condition improved initially but then went rapidly downhill and she was moved to the intensive care unit on Feb 1. \n Things did not improve, and as the woman's health worsened and her organs began to fail, the doctors needed to act fast. So, after consulting the hospital's ethics committee and the patient's family, the stem cell therapy was started on Feb 9. \n Stem cells are highly adaptive early-stage cells that evolve into different types of fully functioning cells to produce tissue, organs or body fluids. The ones used in the Kunming study came from a laboratory culture of umbilical cords from newborn babies. \n The doctors considered using stem cell therapy because Covid-19 has been shown in other studies to cause severe damage to the lungs, liver and other organs. Tests conducted on animals suggested stem cells might be able to repair that damage. \n According to the paper, the Kunming patient was given the first of three shots on Feb 9. After showing no adverse effects to that initial dose she was given a second three days later. On Feb 13, she was able to get out of bed and take a short walk with only limited help. \n She was given her final shot on Feb 15, and two days later was able to leave the intensive care unit and go back to a regular ward. Her vital signs had returned to normal and a throat swab test for Covid-19 came back negative. \n According to Dr Li Honghui, who is involved in similar trials at Loudi Central Hospital in central China's Hunan province, stem cell injections can deliver significant results within three days. \n \"We cannot stick to the rules, we must be bold and innovative,\" he was quoted as saying in a report by Hunan Daily last week. \n Mr Zhang Xinmin, director of biological technology at the Ministry of Science and Technology in Beijing, told a press conference on February 15 that the preliminary results of stem cell experiments conducted across the country suggested the technology was \"safe and effective\". \n Hospitals in Huanggang, one of the worst hit cities in Hubei, received their first shipment of stem cell shots last week and they would be given to three critically ill patients, state media reported. \n Another paper published on Chinaxiv on Friday said that seven coronavirus patients in Beijing had been given stem cell therapy and responded in a similar way to the woman in Kunming. \n Stem cell technology emerged in the 1980s but remains highly controversial. Scientists initially considered using human embryos as the source for the cells, but the idea drew fire on ethical grounds. \n The research community responded by proposing alternative methods for harvesting stem cells, such as turning normal tissue cells into stem cells, but those efforts were tarnished by a series of scandals in the United States, Japan and South Korea involving the fabrication of experimental data. \n In China, scientists are engaged in cutting edge research on stem cells. While the use of cells from healthy embryos is forbidden, scientists are permitted to use fertilised eggs discarded due to illness or defects. \n A doctor treating coronavirus patients in Beijing, who asked not to be named, said there was a growing discussion within the medical community about the potential benefits of stem cell therapy. \n \"The stem cell industry may have some vested interest to promote their technology in this crisis, but if it really works, it should be made available to more patients,\" she said.

The medical impact of the new coronavirus is coming into sharper focus as it continues its spread in what is now officially recognized as a pandemic.\nIts true fatality rate isn't yet known, but it seems 10 times higher than the flu, which kills hundreds of thousands around the world each year, the United States' top infectious disease expert told lawmakers last week.\nMost people have had mild to moderate illness and recovered, but the virus is more serious for those who are older or have other health problems.\nThat's a huge number, said Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now heads a global health organization. In the U.S., 60% of adults have at least one underlying health condition and 42% have two or more.\n\"There's still a lot that we don't know\" about the virus and disease it causes, COVID-19, he said.\nHOW IT SPREADS\nMost spread is from droplets produced when an infected person coughs, which are inhaled by people nearby. Transmission from touching contaminated surfaces hasn't been shown yet, though recent tests by U.S. scientists suggest it's possible -- one reason they recommend washing your hands and not touching your face.\nThe virus can live in the air for several hours, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Cleaning surfaces with solutions containing diluted bleach should kill it.\n\"While we are still learning about the biology of this virus, it does not appear that there is a major risk of spread through sweat,\" said Julie Fischer, a Georgetown University microbiologist. The biggest concern about going to the gym is infected people coughing on others, or contaminating shared surfaces or equipment, she said. Consider avoiding large classes and peak hours and don't go if you're coughing or feverish, she suggests.\nThe risk of virus transmission from food servers is the same risk as transmission from other infected people, but \"one of the concerns in that food servers, like others facing stark choices about insurance and paychecks, may be pressured to work even if they are sick,\" she said.\nHOW FAST DOES IT SPREAD?\nEach infected person spreads to two or three others on average, researchers estimate. It spreads more easily than flu but less than measles, tuberculosis or some other respiratory diseases. It is not known if it spreads less easily among children, but fewer of them have been diagnosed with the disease. A study of 1,099 patients in China found that 0.9% of the cases were younger than 15.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nMost people get fever and cough, sometimes fatigue or shortness of breath, and recover after about two weeks. About 15% develop severe disease, including pneumonia, Chinese scientists reported from 45,000 cases there. Symptoms usually start slowly and often worsen as the illness goes on.\nIn a report last week on the first 12 patients in the U.S., seven were hospitalized; most had underlying health problems and got worse during the second week of illness.\nIn China, slightly more males have been diagnosed with COVID-19 than females, which might be because roughly half of Chinese men smoke but only 5% of females do, Frieden said.\nChildren seem to get less sick -- a report on 10 in China found that fevers tended to be milder and they lacked clear signs of pneumonia.\nWHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE?\nSome cruise ship passengers described symptoms similar to the common cold or flu.\n\"It's been a 2 on a scale of 10,\" said Carl Goldman, who was hospitalized in Omaha, Nebraska, after flying home.\nHowever, a Chinese postgraduate student described going to the hospital twice after her symptoms worsened, and feeling \"a heavy head while walking, unable to breathe, and nauseous.\"\nWHAT'S THE TEST LIKE?\nThe CDC recommends at least two swabs -- nose and throat. Samples are sent to labs that look for bits of viral genetic material, which takes roughly 4 to 6 hours. Altogether, it can take several days to ship a sample and get results back.\nIt's been taking two to three days, and \"we are working really hard to see if we can shorten that time\" by developing an in-house test, Dr. Aimee Moulin of the University of California, Davis said Thursday in a conference call held by the American College of Emergency Physicians.\nSome areas have opened drive-thru sites for testing, which could reduce exposure to health workers and other patients or the public.\nWHEN IS THE VIRUS MOST CONTAGIOUS?\nThe average time from exposure to developing symptoms is five to six days, but can be up to two weeks. Tests have found high amounts of virus in the throats and noses of people a couple days before they show symptoms.\nSigns of virus also have been found in stool weeks after patients recover, but that doesn't mean it's capable of causing illness, scientists warn.\n\"The virus can be degraded,\" said Robert Webster, a St. Jude Children's Research Center virus expert. \"It's not necessarily infectious virus at all.\"\nHOW DEADLY IS IT?\nThat won't be known until large studies are done to test big groups of people to see how many have been infected and with or without symptoms.\nScientists have estimated the fatality rate from less than 1% to as high as 4% among cases diagnosed so far, depending on location.\nFlu kills about 0.1% of those it infects, so the new virus seems about 10 times more lethal, the National Institutes of Health's Dr. Anthony Fauci told Congress last week.\nThe death rate has been higher among people with other health problems -- more than 10% for those with heart disease, for example. In the U.S., 30 million have diabetes, more than 70 million are obese and nearly 80 million have high blood pressure.\nCAN INFECTED PEOPLE WHO RECOVER GET IT AGAIN?\nIt's not known. A few reports from China say some people had COVID-19, recovered and then fell ill again. It's unclear if that's a relapse, a new infection, or a case where the person never fully recovered in the first place.\nScientists at the at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle say the 30,000-letter genetic code of the virus changes by one letter every 15 days. It's not known how many of these changes would be needed for the virus to seem different enough to the immune system of someone who had a previous version of it for it to cause a fresh infection.\nFauci told Congress on Thursday that it was unlikely that someone could get reinfected.\n\"We haven't formally proved it, but it is strongly likely that that's the case,\" he said. \"Because if this acts like any other virus, once you recover, you won't get reinfected.\"\nWILL IT GO AWAY IN THE SUMMER?\nFlu fades each spring and the new virus may do the same, Fauci said last week in a podcast with a journal editor.\n\"I am hoping that as we get into the warmer weather we will see a decline that will give us a chance to get our preparedness up to speed,\" Fauci said.\nBut that, too, is far from certain. \"We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it's a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergencies chief.\nFlu viruses also mutate quickly, requiring new vaccines to be made each year. If the coronavirus follows suit, Frieden said, \"It could become a virus that circulates around the world for many years to come.\"\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Athletes advised to avoid China if possible.

Governments have a responsibility to communicate with their populations on this,” Ryan told the board.\n"}, {"content": "Evacuation of Japanese citizens from Wuhan in spotlight after two returnees refuse testing. TOKYO - Two Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan who refused to undergo tests for the new coronavirus have set off a political quandary in Japan over the evacuation mission, with debate centred on how the human rights of a minority should not supersede a potential health menace to society. \n The two, who were among 206 nationals on Japan's first chartered flight out of the epicentre of the 2019-nCOV outbreak which landed at Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Wednesday, had displayed no symptoms at the airport and were \"escorted home\" after refusing to undergo further tests. Their actions came as three new cases of the virus were identified from the evacuees. \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had to step in to calm nerves on Thursday (Jan 30). \n \"While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so,\" Mr Abe told the Diet, as Japan's Parliament is known. \"There are some areas that the government is reluctant to forcefully step in because it encroaches on human rights. But from the second flight we should see how we can properly confirm the health status of all evacuees.\" \n He stressed: \"We will do our utmost to protect the lives and health of the people, and we will make decisions without hesitation.\" \n While the new Wuhan virus has been named a \"designated infectious disease\" in Japan under a special law, it only allows the authorities to make compulsory the hospitalisation of confirmed patients. \n This issue has flared up in Japan, stirring debate among Twitter users, who argue that upholding the human rights of two people should not be more important than averting a potential health menace to society. \n The term \"kensa kyohi\" (rejection of inspection) is trending on the social media platform, with many calling the duo irresponsible and asking for details like where they live so that they can avoid the neighbourhood. Some have gone as far as to say that they should not have been allowed on the chartered flight in the first place. \n Emotions are running high as Japan diagnosed its first cases with no visible flu symptoms on Thursday. These were among the 206 people who returned a day earlier. \n The question, of whether people who have been infected but show no symptoms can still spread the virus, remains unresolved. \n Among the 206, five had been immediately warded upon landing after they reported having a fever and cough. None subsequently tested positive for the Wuhan bug. \n Of the other 199 who had agreed to further tests at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), seven were hospitalised after flu symptoms were confirmed. \n Among these seven, one 2019-nCOV case was found: a man in his 50s who had a runny nose and a sore throat. He subsequently developed a 38.7 deg C fever. \n And among the remaining 191, two cases, a man and a woman in their 40s, had displayed no visible symptoms and were identified only through NIID tests. They have been quarantined. \n Meanwhile, a second chartered flight, carrying 210 Japanese citizens, landed at Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Thursday. Of these, 13 people who had fever or cough have been hospitalised, public broadcaster NHK reported. Another 300 people who are still stranded in Wuhan want to return to Japan, the Foreign Ministry said. At least one more chartered flight is being planned. \n Further, an Osaka tour guide in her 40s has also tested positive for the 2019-nCOV virus. The tour guide had worked with a previously-identified case - a Japanese bus driver in his 50s who lives in Nara prefecture - in leading a group of tourists from Wuhan from Jan 12 to 17. The group travelled from Narita Airport, to the east of Tokyo, to Kansai International Airport in Osaka. Both cases have no recent travel history to the virus-hit central Chinese city, and the Health Ministry said they were likely infected when travelling with the group of tourists. \n The government is doing urgent contact tracing to identify any people who have come in close contact with the tour group, including in Yamanashi prefecture near Mount Fuji and in Osaka. \n Japan now has a total of 11 confirmed cases of the virus. \n "}, {"content": "Neues Virus in China: Fälle auch in Europa werden wahrscheinlicher. \nNach dem Anstieg der Patientenzahl in China halten Experten vereinzelte Einschleppungen der neuen Lungenkrankheit nach Europa für immer wahrscheinlicher. Es sei nicht auszuschließen, dass eine erkrankte Person nach Deutschland reise, sagte Lars Schaade, Vizepräsident des Robert Koch-Instituts (RKI) in Berlin. Sorgen müsse man sich in Deutschland aber nicht machen.\n„Wir müssen in den kommenden Tagen mit mehr Fällen in anderen Teilen Chinas und möglicherweise auch in anderen Ländern rechnen“, erklärte der Sprecher der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO), Tarik Jašarević, am Dienstag in Genf. Ungewöhnlich sei das nicht: „Wenn man die Überwachung ausweitet, ist es auch wahrscheinlich, dass man mehr Fälle entdeckt.“\nDie Gesundheitsbehörde der zentralchinesischen Metropole Wuhan meldete weitere Tote durch das neuartige Coronavirus. Insgesamt sind nun sechs Todesfälle bestätigt, zumeist betrafen sie ältere Menschen mit schweren Vorerkrankungen. Zudem wurden am Dienstag Dutzende weitere Infektionen gemeldet. Damit gibt es nun in China mehr als 300 bestätigte Fälle seit Beginn des Ausbruchs im Dezember.\nNachweise gibt es zudem in Taiwan, Thailand, Japan und Südkorea - in allen Fällen erkrankten Menschen, die zuvor in Wuhan waren. „Wir müssen uns in Deutschland darauf vorbereiten, dass es zumindest in Einzelfällen auch zu Einschleppungen der Erkrankung kommt“, sagte der Berliner Virusforscher Christian Drosten. „Kliniken müssen dann darauf vorbereitet sein, die Patienten zu isolieren.“\nDas Gesundheitsrisiko für die Bevölkerung in Deutschland wird vom zuständigen RKI derzeit als „sehr gering“ eingestuft. Zwar könne es einzelne Fälle von Importen geben, fortgesetzte Infektionsketten - also anschließende Übertragungen von Mensch zu Mensch - seien nach derzeitigem Stand aber unwahrscheinlich, so RKI-Vizepräsident Schaade. Auch beim Mers-Coronavirus seien vereinzelt Infizierte nach Deutschland gekommen, ohne dass es daraufhin in Deutschland zu weiteren Übertragungen gekommen sei.\nAuch das Bundesgesundheitsministerium schätzt die Gefahr für Deutschland als gering ein. „Trotzdem beobachten wir die Situation in China natürlich aufmerksam und stehen dazu in ständigem Austausch mit unseren internationalen Partnern“, sagte ein Sprecher des Bundesgesundheitsministeriums.\nMit der gerade laufenden Reisewelle zum chinesischen Neujahrsfest am kommenden Samstag wächst die Gefahr einer Ausbreitung des Virus.

Das italienische Gesundheitsministerium kündigte an, Verdachtsfälle an Bord in Rom landender Flugzeuge aus Wuhan künftig zu überprüfen. Piloten sollen demnach Passagiere mit entsprechenden Symptomen melden. Diese würden dann sofort in das nationale Institut für Infektionskrankheiten in Rom gebracht, hieß es.\nAn deutschen Flughäfen gibt es vorerst keine speziellen Maßnahmen. Der Flughafen Frankfurt hat aber Vorbereitungen getroffen. „Der Plan liegt in der Schublade“, sagte eine Sprecherin der Betreibergesellschaft Fraport am Dienstag. Wenn das Gesundheitsamt in Frankfurt Empfehlungen ausspreche, würden diese umgesetzt. Direktflüge aus Wuhan nach Frankfurt gebe es keine.\nAuch vom Flughafen Düsseldorf hieß es, bisher halte das zuständige Gesundheitsamt noch keine Maßnahmen für erforderlich. Sollte sich ein Verdachtsfall an Bord einer Maschine Richtung Düsseldorf befinden, gäbe der Pilot einen Hinweis an die Flugsicherung oder den Airport, erklärte ein Sprecher weiter. „Der Flughafen würde sofort das Gesundheitsamt informieren und die entsprechende Maschine später in einem separaten Bereich platzieren.“\nVom Robert Koch-Institut hieß es, es gebe ohnehin keine wissenschaftlichen Belege für die Wirksamkeit sogenannter Entry Screenings an Flughäfen, also Kontrollen bei der Einreise. Sinnvoll seien aber Exit Screenings in von einer Erkrankungswelle besonders betroffenen Gebieten. Die 11-Millionen-Metropole Wuhan hat entsprechende Kontrollen bei der Ausreise bereits eingeführt.\nDie Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) hat wegen der Lungenkrankheit ihren Notfallausschuss einberufen. Die Experten sollten am Mittwoch beraten. Sollte die WHO einen internationalen Gesundheitsnotstand ausrufen, empfiehlt sie damit schärfere Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Seuche. Dazu können unter anderem Grenzkontrollen und das Einrichten spezialisierter Behandlungszentren gehören.\nDerzeit empfiehlt die WHO keinerlei Reise- oder Handelsbeschränkungen. „Auf Grundlage der vorhandenen Informationen gibt es keine Rechtfertigung für Beschränkungen von Reisen oder Handel“, sagte der Sprecher. „Sollte die Situation eskalieren, könnte die WHO sich zu den Risiken von Reisen in betroffene Gegenden äußern.“\nAuch die EU-Kommission plant zur Bewertung der Risiken durch die neue Lungenkrankheit ein Treffen. Nach Angaben eines Sprechers soll der Ausschuss für Gesundheitssicherheit am Donnerstag zusammenkommen.

The company also forecast revenue per available room growth — a measure of a hotel’s financial performance — to be between flat and up 2% in 2020.\nThe hotel operator said it expects 2020 earnings, excluding the impact of the virus, to be between $6.30 and $6.53 per share. Analysts were expecting $6.47 per share, according to Refinitiv data.\n"}, {"content": "Bremen bereitet Corona-Krisenstab vor. \nDas Gesundheitsressort bereitet derzeit einen Krisenstab vor, um für den Coronavirus-Ernstfall gewappnet zu sein. Nach Angaben von Martin Götz, Referatsleiter für den Infektionsschutz bei der Gesundheitssenatorin, haben die sieben Todesfälle und 220 bestätigten Patienten in Italien „neue Dynamik in die Entwicklung gebracht“. Mit dem Krisenstab will sich die Behörde für den Fall rüsten, dass der als Covid-19 bezeichnete Virus auch in der Hansestadt auftritt.\nEs herrsche nicht mehr die ruhige Stimmung wie noch vor drei Wochen, berichtet Götz aus einer Expertenkonferenz am Montag. Daran hatten Vertreter aller Bundesländer, des Bundes sowie des Berliner Robert-­Koch-Instituts teilgenommen. Dabei stand auch die Frage im Raum, ob die betroffenen italienischen Regionen Lombardei und Venetien künftig als Risikogebiete geführt werden. Eine entsprechende Entscheidung gab es bis zum Abend zwar nicht, wurde von Götz aber als „sehr wahrscheinlich“ für die kommenden Tage eingeschätzt. Das hänge von der weiteren Entwicklung in Italien ab.\nDas Robert-Koch-Institut hat seine Empfehlungen zu den Risikogebieten am Montag bereits erweitert, ohne Italien direkt zu benennen. Es gebe Länder und Regionen, in denen einzelne Infektionsfälle mit und ohne Rückverfolgbarkeit der Infektionsketten oder auch Infektions-Cluster aufgetreten sind, heißt es darin. Bei entsprechenden Symptomen und Aufenthalten in solchen Ländern, sei darum an Covid-19 als mögliche Diagnose zu denken.\nAuch seine Risikoeinschätzung insgesamt hat das Institut angepasst. Mit einem Import weiterer Fälle nach Deutschland müsse gerechnet werden. Weitere Übertragungen, Infektionsketten und lokale Infektionsgeschehen in Deutschland seien möglich. Es sei davon auszugehen, dass es nicht mehr gelingen werde, die weltweite Ausbreitung des Erregers aufzuhalten, auch wenn die Gesundheitsgefahren in Deutschland aktuell als gering eingeschätzt würden.\nVor diesem Hintergrund betrachtet Götz es als sinnvoll, einen Bremer Krisenstab zumindest vorzubereiten. Das bedeutet, dass die Senatsressorts sowie Feuerwehr und Polizei ihre jeweils Verantwortlichen benennen, „um im Ernstfall sofort den Schalter umlegen zu können“. Aufgabe eines Krisenstabs ist es, die im Infektionsschutzgesetz vorgesehenen Möglichkeiten zu nutzen, um weitere Erkrankungen zu verhindern. Denkbar ist, Einrichtungen wie Schulen oder Kitas zu schließen oder auch wie in Italien ganze Städte abzuriegeln. Was jeweils „angemessen und verhältnismäßig“ sei, müsse man sehen, sagt Götz. Er berichtet, dass die Maßnahmen in Italien von den deutschen Experten mehrheitlich als „übertrieben“ eingeschätzt werden. „Auch die Einweisung von 20 Patienten auf Intensivstationen macht uns eher stutzig.“\nSollte es zu einer Einstufung italienischer Regionen als Risikogebiete kommen, dürfte sich die Zahl der abklärungsbedürftigen Covid-19-Verdachtsfälle auch in Bremen deutlich erhöhen. Denn anders als mit China existieren beispielsweise direkte Flugverbindungen nach Italien. Insgesamt ist der Reiseverkehr zwischen Italien und Deutschland achtmal höher als zwischen Deutschland und China.\nEin konkreter Verdacht auf eine Erkrankung mit dem neuen Virus liegt dann vor, wenn zwei Umstände zusammenkommen: zum einen die klinischen Symptome der Krankheit wie Husten, Fieber und Atemnot, zum anderen muss der Betroffene in den 14 Tagen davor entweder Kontakt zu einem bestätigten Covid-19-Patienten gehabt oder sich in einem Risikogebiet aufgehalten haben. Das sind nach den Empfehlungen des Robert-­Koch-Instituts bislang Regionen in China, Korea und im Iran.\nDie Hausärzte sind nach Angaben von Holger Schelb vom Hausärzteverband Bremen aufgefordert, ausschließlich klinische Symptome und die Vorgeschichte abzuklären, dann aber keine weitere Diagnostik anzustellen. „Sollte ein abklärungsbedürftiger Fall auftreten, würden wir den Patienten je nach Schwere der Symptomatik entweder in ein Krankenhaus überweisen oder aber nach Hause schicken, mit der Aufforderung, dort zu verbleiben“, sagt Schelb. Die weiteren Untersuchungen stelle das Gesundheitsamt an, um unmittelbar alle Informationen zu erhalten. Ein solcher Ablauf ist aber laut Schelb bislang in Bremen nicht vorgekommen.\n"}, {"content": "Covid-19. Dois deputados britânicos isolam-se como medida de precaução. Dois deputados do Partido Trabalhista britânico anunciaram esta sexta-feira que vão isolar-se nas suas casas durante vários dias como medida de precaução, depois de participarem num congresso em Londres em que um dos participantes foi diagnosticado com o coronavírus Covid-19.\nO sistema de saúde pública da Inglaterra (NHS, na sigla em inglês) contactou as cerca de 200 pessoas que participaram no passado dia 6 num congresso que reuniu profissionais da indústria de autocarros e transportes no centro Queen Elizabeth II, perto do parlamento britânico.\nUm dos participantes foi identificado, dias depois, como uma das nove pessoas infetadas pelo coronavírus no Reino Unido. \"Embora seja pouco provável que o grau de contacto que os participantes da conferência possam ter com este caso seja significativo, optamos por uma abordagem prudente e vamos informando sobre a situação\", indicou um porta-voz do NHS.\nA deputada trabalhista Lilian Greenwood, ex-presidente da comissão de Transporte do parlamento, anunciou através das redes sociais que se encontra \"completamente bem\", mas optou por ser \"extremamente cautelosa\" e cancelou todos os compromissos públicos durante as próximas duas semanas.\nTambém o deputado Alex Sobel indicou que foi contactado pelas autoridades de saúde, que lhe transmitiram que existe um \"risco muito baixo\" de que tenha sido infetado, no entanto optou por permanecer em casa pelo menos até a próxima quinta-feira.\nA epidemia provocada pelo coronavírus (Covid-19) detetado em Wuhan, causou já 1.380 mortos, tendo a China reportado hoje 121 mortes nas últimas 24 horas. Segundo a Comissão Nacional de Saúde, o número de infetados cresceu 5.090, para 63.581.\nO balanço é superior ao da Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave (SARS, na sigla em inglês), que entre 2002 e 2003 causou a morte a 774 pessoas em todo o mundo, a maioria das quais na China, mas a taxa de mortalidade permanece inferior.\nAlém da China continental, Hong Kong, Japão e as Filipinas reportaram um morto cada um e, embora 30 países tenham diagnosticado casos de pneumonia por Covid-19, a China responde por cerca de 99% dos infetados.\n"}, {"content": "India-US coalition begin clinical trials for coronavirus. Supported by a global coalition founded by India and Norway, the United has begun the phase one clinical trial of an investigational vaccine designed to protect against the coronavirus disease which has claimed the lives of over 7,000 people globally.\n\nThe trial began at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle as the first participant received the investigational vaccine.\n\"I'm pleased to report today that a vaccine candidate has begun the phase one clinical trial. This is one of the fastest vaccine development launches in history. Not even close. We're also racing to develop antiviral therapies and other treatments,\" Trump told reporters at a White House news conference on Monday.\nThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, is funding the trial. The open-label trial will enrol 45 healthy adult volunteers aged 18 to 55 years over approximately six weeks.\n\"Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,\" said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci.\n\"This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step towards achieving that goal,\" he said.\nAccording to the NIH, the study is evaluating different doses of the experimental vaccine for safety and its ability to induce an immune response in participants. This is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of the vaccine.\nThe vaccine is called mRNA-1273 and was developed by the NIAID scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nThe Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the Phase 1 clinical trial, the NIH said.\nConceived in 2015, CEPI was founded in Davos in 2017 by the governments of Norway and India, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and the World Economic Forum.\nAccording to its website, CEPI so far has secured USD 760 million toward its USD 1 billion funding target, with multi-year funding from Norway, the UK, Germany, Japan, Canada, Ethiopia, Australia, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Wellcome.\nAmong its 12 voting members are Cherry Gagandeep Kang from Christian Medical College Vellore and Rajeev Venkayya Vaccine Business Unit, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Indian Soumya Swaminathan is a non-voting member and represents the World Health Organization in the board.\nEarly this week, CEPI, the organisation set up to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, made an urgent call for USD 2 billion to support the development of a vaccine against the virus responsible for COVID-19.\nIn a statement, the NIH said that infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can cause a mild to severe respiratory illness and include symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath.\nThe number of deaths due to coronavirus has passed 7,000 worldwide. More than 175,530 cases have been recorded in 145 countries.\nCOVID-19 cases were first identified in December 2019 in China's Wuhan in Hubei province. As of March 15, the WHO has reported 153,517 cases of COVID-19 and 5,735 deaths worldwide. More than 2,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 58 deaths have been reported in the United States as of March 15, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\"Currently, no approved vaccines exist to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2,\" the NIH said, adding that investigational vaccine was developed using a genetic platform called mRNA (messenger RNA).\nThe investigational vaccine directs the body's cells to express a virus protein that, it is hoped, will elicit a robust immune response. The mRNA-1273 vaccine has shown promise in animal models, and this is the first trial to examine it in humans, it said.\nScientists at NIAID's Vaccine Research Center and Moderna were able to quickly develop mRNA-1273 because of prior studies of related coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\nThe Phase 1 trial is led by Lisa A Jackson, MD, senior investigator at KPWHRI. Study participants will receive two doses of the vaccine via intramuscular injection in the upper arm approximately 28 days apart. Each participant will be assigned to receive a 25 microgram (mcg), 100 mcg or 250 mcg dose at both vaccinations, with 15 people in each dose cohort, according to a statement.\nThe first four participants will receive one injection with the low dose, and the next four participants will receive the 100 mcg dose.\nInvestigators will review safety data before vaccinating the remaining participants in the 25 and 100 mcg dose groups and before participants receive their second vaccinations.\nAnother safety review will be done before participants are enrolled in the 250 mcg cohort.\n\"This work is critical to national efforts to respond to the threat of this emerging virus. We are prepared to conduct this important trial because of our experience as an NIH clinical trials center since 2007,\" Dr Jackson said.\n"}, {"content": "Covid-19 já está a espalhar-se mais rapidamente no resto do mundo do que na China. Em cinco dias, desde sábado, o número de infectados pelo novo coronavírus na Europa disparou de cinco dezenas para mais de 450; o número de mortos de um para 14. E com a chegada do coronavírus ao Brasil, com uma confirmação esta quarta-feira em São Paulo, a Antárctica torna-se no único continente sem casos. Entrou-se assim numa nova fase em que o Covid-19 já se espalha mais rapidamente pelo resto do mundo do que na China.\nAinda que o acelerar do surto esteja a gerar uma preocupação assumida no seio da União Europeia (UE), a situação não é, para já, motivo de pânico: a UE voltou a garantir nesta terça-feira estar a trabalhar “em todas as frentes” para prevenir a propagação do novo coronavírus na Europa, insistindo na necessidade de coordenação dos Estados-membros “em tempo real” para enfrentar um fenómeno que é “dinâmico”.\nA Comissão Europeia reforçou que o fundamental é a UE, no seu conjunto, estar “preparada” para um eventual aumento da epidemia, quer a nível de tratamento, quer de contenção do surto. Uma das questões mais delicadas associadas ao aumento de casos, e particularmente à situação em Itália, é a do controlo de fronteiras, que a Comissão tem sublinhado não ser da sua competência, mas sim de cada Estado-membro. No entanto, um cenário deste tipo também não é descartado.\nO país que mais está a preocupar as autoridades de saúde europeias é a Itália. Isto porque desde sexta-feira houve um aumento repentino de casos positivos: nesse dia foram contabilizadas apenas três pessoas infectadas com o vírus, mas entretanto esse número subiu para 400 infectados. Esta quarta-feira foi  também confirmada a décima segunda vítima no país.\nAs autoridades italianas estão a tentar apertar cada vez mais o cerco ao Covid-19: as medidas de contenção anunciadas este fim-de-semana para dez localidades onde vivem ao todo cerca de 50 mil pessoas continuam em vigor. Véneto, Piemonte e Lombardia, no Norte de Itália, são as regiões críticas que estão localizadas na “zona vermelha”.\nPor enquanto, o padrão de mortes registado em Itália é semelhante ao verificado na China. São os mais idosos e com doenças associadas, como cancro, diabetes, doenças respiratórias e outras que deprimem o sistema imunitário, que estão a ser mais afectadas.\nDepois de Itália, a Alemanha continua a ser o país europeu com mais casos, mas sem novas infecções. Já a França confirmou um total de 17 infectados no país e uma segunda vítima mortal: um homem francês de 60 anos morreu de madrugada em Paris depois de ter sido diagnosticado. A Noruega, Áustria, Croácia, Suíça, Espanha, Macedónia do Norte e a Grécia também confirmaram novos casos de infecção.\nAté agora, o único caso conhecido de um português infectado pelo novo vírus é o de Adriano Maranhão, o tripulante de um navio de cruzeiros que foi internado num hospital da cidade japonesa de Okazaki, situada a cerca de 300 quilómetros de Tóquio. Todos os casos suspeitos detectados em Portugal (até esta quarta-feira foram 18) foram negativos.\nO vírus que já fez mais de 2760 mortos (a maior parte na China) espalha-se agora pelo resto do mundo a maior velocidade e já existem pessoas infectadas em mais de 40 países. Além de mortes na China continental, há registo de vítimas no Irão, Coreia do Sul, Itália, Japão, Hong Kong, Filipinas, França e Taiwan.\nA China reportou esta quarta-feira 52 mortes, o menor aumento diário em três semanas, ao mesmo tempo que reportou 406 novos casos, a maioria na província de Hubei. O número de novos pacientes registou assim uma queda de 20%, em comparação com segunda-feira, por exemplo. Segundo os dados actualizados pela Comissão Nacional de Saúde da China o país soma mais de 2700 mortos e 78 mil casos confirmados. Entre os infectados, mais de 45 mil continuavam activos e mais de 8500 pacientes encontravam-se em estado grave. Por outro lado, quase 30 mil pessoas já receberam alta.\nApesar de o Irão ser o país com mais mortes pelo novo coronavírus a seguir à China – só na última semana foram registados 139 casos de infecção e 19 pessoas morreram —, o Presidente Hassan Rouhani disse que o seu Governo não está a planear pôr cidades e distritos do país em quarentena.\nNa entanto, as autoridades já encerraram escolas e algumas universidades e admitem prolongar essa decisão durante mais alguns dias. Existem também planos para restringir o acesso a locais sagrados xiitas esta sexta-feira. Por outro lado, 11 países já “encerraram” as suas fronteiras terrestres e aéreas com o Irão (os vizinhos Iraque, Turquia, Afeganistão, Paquistão e Arménia, e outros países da região como a Arábia Saudita, Kuwait, Jordânia, Emirados Árabes Unidos, Omã e Geórgia).\nEvitar o pânico é uma das mensagens chave da Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS): a directora de saúde pública da organização, Maria Neira, assegurou esta quarta-feira que é “irracional e desproporcionado” que se esgotem as máscaras e os desinfectantes nas farmácias por medo do coronavírus. Em declarações à emissora espanhola RAC-1, Neira recordou que as máscaras são para uso do pessoal de saúde e sublinhou que a diminuição de vítimas e contagiados que está a registar-se na China “poderá significar que a epidemia chegou ao cume e atingiu o pico epidémico”. Mas, por outro lado, Bruce Aylward, o especialista que liderou a equipa da OMS enviada à China alertou que o planeta “não está pronto” para enfrentar uma pandemia deste novo coronavírus.\nQuanto à preparação do nosso país, o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros, garantiu que estamos preparados para uma eventual “entrada” do coronavírus Covid-19. Augusto Santos Silva referiu esta quarta-feira que existe um plano de contingência pronto a ser activado em Portugal. No entanto, salientou que este é um problema global que exige acções concertadas, principalmente a nível europeu.\nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\nComo já havia sido anunciado, Portugal está a reforçar as medidas de prevenção e a rede de laboratórios e hospitais disponíveis para receber casos suspeitos de infecção pelo novo coronavírus. Em termos de medidas futuras, o Governo português não descarta o encerramento de fronteiras, mas reforçou que só o fará em conjunto com União Europeia, em linha com as intenções da Comissão Europeia.\nO pneumologista e coordenador do gabinete de crise da Ordem dos Médicos, Filipe Froes, disse esta quarta-feira à Lusa que, comparando com a capacidade de resposta que houve para a gripe A há dez anos, agora há “menos capacidade de resposta hospitalar, menos recursos humanos e menos diferenciação”. “O desafio vai ser muito maior, mas também tem de ser ajustado à transmissão da doença, ao número de portugueses atingidos e à gravidade”, disse, sublinhando que “o desafio neste momento ainda é desconhecido”.\n"}, {"content": "US warned to prepare for coronavirus pandemic as Europe lockdowns spread.

Franka Lu ist eine chinesische Journalistin und Unternehmerin. Sie arbeitet in China und Deutschland. In dieser ZEIT-ONLINE-Serie berichtet sie kritisch über Leben, Kultur und Alltag in China. Um ihr berufliches und privates Umfeld zu schützen, schreibt sie unter einem Pseudonym.\nDas Coronavirus in China hat für das ungewöhnlichste Frühlingsfest gesorgt, das ich je erlebt habe. Ich lese und höre aus der Ferne von leeren Straßen in den Städten, wenig Feuerwerk, aber viel Furcht allerorten, sogar Wut. Reisebeschränkungen machen die übliche Heimfahrt der Menschen zu ihren Familien kaum möglich. Die Frühlingsfeste, an die ich mich erinnere, erscheinen mir nun wie ein Traum von vor hundert Jahren. Das erfüllt mich mit beinahe nostalgischen Gefühlen.\nAls chinesische Immigrantin habe ich in Deutschland im Winter normalerweise viel mehr Gelegenheiten zum Feiern als die Deutschen selbst: Zu Weihnachten und Neujahr kommt bei mir noch das chinesische Frühlingsfest hinzu beziehungsweise das chinesische Neujahrsfest, das zwischen Ende Januar und Mitte Februar mit dem Jahreswechsel beginnt (diesmal fiel dieser auf den 25. Januar), 15 Tage dauert und mit süßen Reisbällen und dem Laternenfest endet. Die Deutschen dagegen schlagen sich ab dem 2. Januar mit ihrer Nachfeiertagsdepression herum, Ostern erscheint noch kaum sichtbar als Licht am Ende eines sehr langen und kalten Tunnels. Meine Feiertagsstimmung dagegen währt einen oder gar zwei Monate länger, denn das Laternenfest findet Mitte bis Ende Februar statt.\nFür eine im Ausland lebende Chinesin wie mich sind die chinesischen Neujahrsfestivitäten mittlerweile eh eine eher virtuelle Sache. Über die sozialen Medien habe ich in den vergangenen Jahren aus der Ferne beobachtet, wie China in den zwei Wochen des Frühlingsfestes fast vollständig zum Stillstand kommt respektive sich in ein riesiges, immer schnelleres Karussell verwandelt: Die Menschen reisen nach Hause, dorthin, wo ihre Familien leben. Die elf Monate des Jahres, die mit Arbeit und Konkurrenzkampf bis zum Anschlag vollgestopft sind, gehen in einen mit Alkohol und genauso heftiger familiärer Konkurrenz gefüllten Monat über. Die Flut der Reisenden ergießt sich dann normalerweise in allen Richtungen über das ganze Land, es ist kurzzeitig die größte menschliche Wanderbewegung weltweit: Drei Milliarden Reisen zur Familienwiederbegegnung hat man während des Frühlingsfests 2019 gezählt, zu Lande, zu Wasser oder in der Luft waren die knapp 1,4 Milliarden Chinesinnen und Chinesen unterwegs.\nFür Europäerinnen und Europäer mag die Idee einer solch gewaltigen Menge an Reisenden abstrakt klingen, für mich verbindet sich damit die Erinnerung an eine intensive körperliche Erfahrung, als ich noch in China lebte. Es begann immer mindestens einen Monat früher, wenn ich um Tickets für Flugzeug, Zug und Bus kämpfte, um rechtzeitig zu Hause zu sein – im Wettstreit mit Millionen keineswegs weniger eifrig reisesuchender Chinesinnen und Chinesen. Dann derselbe Wettstreit, der Kampf um ein Taxi, um rechtzeitig am Flughafen oder Bahnhof zu sein; Anstehen für mindestens zwei bis drei Sicherheitschecks, mit subtilem oder nicht so subtilem Ellbogeneinsatz oder strategischer Positionierung, um andere am Vordrängeln zu hindern; Knuffe und Rüffel, weil ich mich nicht schnell genug vorwärts bewegte; gelegentlich Streit und Kampf um den Sitzplatz im Zug, obwohl ich das Ticket mit der Reservierung hatte und der, der dort saß, eben nicht … Ich habe den Geruch all der Transitorte noch in der Nase: die Mixtur aus starken Körperausdünstungen, billigen Plastiktaschen und mürbem Kofferleder, Putzmittel auf Marmor- oder Betonböden, die Anspannung der Menschen wie Holzkohlengeruch in der Luft.\nSo richtig begannen die Frühlingsfestfeierlichkeiten erst, wenn zum Beispiel der Zug sich langsam in Bewegung setzte. Erleichterung und Glück. Sogleich öffneten die Mitreisenden im Zug ihre Taschen, und der Duft aller möglichen Lebensmittel waberte bald durch die Waggons. Je weniger luxuriös die Reise war, desto mehr Essen und Getränke wurden zwischen den Passagieren geteilt. Die Leute fragten einander nach ihren Berufen, Familien, Familienstatus und Einkommen, machten dazu passende mitfühlende Geräusche oder gaben ungebeten Tipps, wie man mit privaten Problemen umgehen solle. Als junge Frau war das für mich alles bewegend und verunsichernd zugleich.\nIm Lauf der Jahre sind mir auf den Frühlingsfestreisen nicht nur köstliche Speisen, sondern auch Besuche bei Wildfremden und sogar ein paar potenzielle Ehemänner offeriert worden. Die Begegnung, die mich am meisten beeindruckt hat, fand allerdings in einem Fernreisebus statt. Eine junge Frau im Sitz neben mir legte, kaum war sie aus einem längeren Schlaf erwacht, ihren Ellbogen auf meine Schulter und begann, ihre Haare zu bürsten. Ich verhielt mich still und ließ mich ohne Widerstand während des ganzen Vorgangs als ihre Frisierkommode benutzen. Sie schien mir eine Arbeitsmigrantin zu sein. Vielleicht war sie einsam, und ich war nur schüchtern. Wir wechselten kein einziges Wort.\nSeitdem ich mir Flugzeug- und Schnellzugtickets leisten konnte, ist es nicht mehr zu intimen Begegnungen dieser Art gekommen. Die Reisen zum Frühlingsfest sind überhaupt weniger herausfordernd und viel ordentlicher geworden. Die guten Mobilfunkverbindungen entlang der Strecke sorgten in den vergangenen Jahren dafür, dass man statt Gesprächen der Mitreisenden zunehmend Video- und Gamegeräusche, Telefonanrufe und Chats über soziale Medien zu hören bekam. Was sich bis zuletzt nicht verändert hat, ist der allgegenwärtige Essensgeruch. Ich habe einen deutschen Freund bei einer meiner bis dato letzten Frühlingsfestreisen regelrecht entsetzt, als ich mein am Shanghaier Schnellbahnhof erstandenes Päckchen mit gewürzten Entenfüßen auspackte. Das ist der letzte Rest Nationalstolz, den ich bisher nicht losgeworden bin.\nEs brauchte früher einigen Mut, als Jugendliche – die weggezogen, aber noch nicht definitiv anderswo angekommen war – in den Heimatort zurückzukehren. Im Alten China sagte man 近乡情怯: Je näher du der Heimatstadt kommst, desto nervöser wirst du. Im Westen sind diese gemischten Gefühle den Menschen von Weihnachten her vertraut. \"Du weißt nie, welchen Prüfungen du durch deine Eltern oder diverse Verwandte unterzogen wirst. Diese Mischung aus Sehnsucht nach Heimkehr und Angst vor solchen Attacken nennen wir … Schrödingers Frühlingsfest.\" So heißt es im Vorspiel zu einem Lied, das unter jungen Städtern in China sehr beliebt ist, Tipps zur Selbsthilfe beim Frühlingsfest, gesungen vom Regenbogenchor aus Shanghai. Der nach dem Liedtitel benannte Hashtag auf Douban, einer der größten Social-Media-Plattformen, ist mittlerweile auch sehr beliebt, 2,5 Millionen Zugriffe und mehr als tausend Tipps.\nFamilien, die mit den Leistungen ihrer Kinder angeben, gibt es natürlich nicht nur in China, aber das Konkurrenzdenken und die schamlose Grenzüberschreitung können doch überwältigender sein als in Europa: Wie die Fremden im Zug fragen auch ältere Verwandte während des Frühlingsfestes gern nach dem Einkommen der Jüngeren, nach Dates und Heiratsabsichten, nach den Details von Geburtsplänen, Erziehungsplänen für die Babys – erneut gibt es ungefragt Ratschläge gratis dazu. Es ist auch keineswegs ungewöhnlich, dass dein Gewicht, die Länge deiner Beine und deines Halses, deine Ernährung, deine Haut kommentiert werden. Natürlich alles aus reiner Fürsorge.\nWenn die Prahlerei (und sei es nur nach außen hin) stolzer Eltern erst einmal losgeht, wirbeln die Einsätze beim Spiel auf den Tisch. Der Sohn ist befördert worden, der andere hat ein dickes Baby; die eine Tochter hat ihren Eltern ein luxuriöses Apartment geschenkt, die andere hat die Eltern auf einen Europatrip mitgenommen … Dann ist die Zeit gekommen, die Segenswünsche in Form von Geld in roten Umschlägen (红包 oder Hongbao) an die Kinder und die Senioren zu überreichen. Das ist der finale, brutale Einsatz: Wohlstand.\nDer Hongbao-Wettbewerb hat sich in den vergangenen Jahren allerdings dank des Internetimperiums Tencent sehr verändert. Zum Frühlingsfest 2014 hat Tencent in seiner Social-Media-App WeChat einen neuen In-App-Service namens WeChat Hongbao gestartet. Da ohnehin überall digital gezahlt wird, wurde das sofort ein Erfolg: 823 Millionen Teilnehmer haben den Service beim Frühlingsfest 2019 genutzt. Für Mitglieder eines Gruppenchats bietet WeChat Hongbao sogar die Möglichkeit, um dasselbe Hongbao zu konkurrieren.\nWeChat hat in der Konsequenz eine alte chinesische Sitte in gleich drei Hinsichten verändert. Zum einen diktierte die Gewohnheit früher nur, dass man Gelder an Familienmitglieder verteilt; nun aber ist man irgendwie verpflichtet, auch Freunde und Kollegen zu bedenken. Zweitens geben heute viele Internetfirmen zwecks Kundenbindung auch digitale Hongbao an ihre Nutzer. Die Kurzvideoplattform Kuaishou wird in diesem Jahr Hongbaos in Höhe von einer Milliarde Yuan (knapp 130 Millionen Euro) überweisen. Und drittens ist der geografische Abstand kein Grund mehr, auf das Überreichen der roten Umschläge zu verzichten, das geht nun von überall auf der Welt, egal wo man lebt, und sei es auf der Insel Palau.\nWährend der Festtagswochen starren seitdem viele Chinesen auf ihre Handys, um einen Teil des Glücks zu erhaschen. Bald entstanden neue Apps, die den Gierigen dabei helfen sollten, automatisch an die digitalen Umschläge von Unternehmen zu kommen. Ich habe bislang keinen Wettbewerb gewonnen, denn ich war in den vergangenen Jahren zu weit weg: Wann immer ich die Umschläge auf dem Bildschirm entdeckte, hatte sie schon jemand in China geleert. Mit diesen falschen Versprechen verhält es sich wie mit fernen Sternen am Himmel: Was ich sehe, ist nur die Erinnerung an längst Vergangenes. Und doch muss auch ich meine Hongbaos online verteilen. Zum Glück hat WeChat eine Obergrenze für die Summe jedes einzelnen roten Umschlags in einer Chatgruppe festgesetzt: 200 Yuan, etwa 26 Euro.\nDoch nicht nur Emigranten sehen dem Treiben während des Frühlingsfestes von Weitem zu. 热闹, die Versammlung einer großen, ausgelassenen Menge, ist zwar der Kern weltlichen Glücks in der chinesischen Gesellschaft, aber immer mehr Menschen haben genug davon. Einige Reiche, jedoch auch manche Mittelschichtfamilien machen heute Überseeurlaube, um dem Lärm, dem Verkehr und der Luftverschmutzung Chinas zu entfliehen, die zum Beispiel die vielen Feuerwerke während des Frühlingsfestes mit sich bringen. Die Länder Südostasiens und Japan sind die Lieblingsdestinationen, die wirklich Reichen und Weltläufigen bevorzugen noch fernere Ecken des Planeten. Doch wohin auch immer sie fliehen, die meisten von ihnen bleiben doch auf WeChat verbunden, um Fotos und Videos zu posten und mit Freunden und Verwandten zu chatten. Das ist ein etwas anderer Frühlingsfestwettbewerb. Je weiter weg von zu Hause du bist, desto besser. Ich bleibe hingegen genau da, wo ich bin, und auch das ist schon eine ziemliche Leistung.\nEine traditionelle Frühlingsfestaktivität habe ich irgendwann zu boykottieren begonnen, nämlich die Neujahrsgala von China Central TV. Diese Fernsehshow wurde 1983 vom Regierungssender ins Leben gerufen, das gemeinsame Ansehen nach dem opulenten Mal ist längst zum unverzichtbaren Element der Familienfeier geworden. Ich bin damit aufgewachsen und habe nach und nach den Geschmack daran verloren, als sich mein politisches Denken und meine ethischen Standards veränderten. Ich habe von den Geschichten hinter der Bühne erfahren: vom berühmten Regisseur, der wegen der Annahme von Bestechungsgeldern ins Gefängnis kam; eine nach der anderen wurden die schönen Sängerinnen zu Liebhaberinnen politischer Führer; beliebte Comedians wurden aus der Show geschmissen und durften auch sonst in keiner Sendung mehr auftreten, weil sie auf der Wahrung ihrer Urheberrechte insistierten … Hässliche Machtspiele sind unvermeidlich in einer Sendung, die darauf abzielt, am Neujahrstag die Seelen von 1,4 Milliarden Menschen zu verführen und zu formen.\nEs gab in diesem Jahr vereinzelte Rufe danach, die Show aufgrund des Ausbruchs des neuen Coronavirus abzusagen. Sie ging dann aber ohne große Erwähnung der Kranken und Sterbenden über die Bühne. Im Netz wurde das scharf als \"Discotanz auf den Gräbern\" kommentiert. Viele jüngere Leute berichteten in den sozialen Medien von ihrem Abscheu vor der Heile-Welt-Show. Eine insgesamt wohl noch kleine, aber doch wachsende Menge junger Leute gerade in den Großstädten erträgt die Gala schon länger nicht mehr, ihre peinliche Ästhetik, die gezwungene Fröhlichkeit, die demonstrative Zurschaustellung der Liebe zu Armee und Partei, die Genderstereotypen, das Feiern der traditionellen Familie. Nicht das geringste bisschen Negativität oder Kritik ist erlaubt, Liebe und Glück sind verpflichtend: Schau auf das grandiose Gesamtbild der Nation und vergiss jeden Schmerz. Und die Eltern haben stets recht und sind voller Fürsorge, ebenso wie die Partei und ihre Armee.\nIn Dörfern und Kleinstädten sieht alles ein wenig anders aus. Die jüngeren unter den heimkehrenden Wanderarbeitern und -arbeiterinnen haben eine zusätzliche Verpflichtung während der Frühlingsfesttage: Sie werden zu Blind Dates geschickt, die die Familien und professionelle Ehevermittler für sie vorbereitet haben. Sie müssen in diesen zehn Tagen einen Ehemann oder eine Ehefrau finden, denn sie haben im restlichen Jahr meist keinen Urlaub. Von der Familie arrangierte Blind Dates sind über Jahrhunderte hinweg die Norm in China gewesen. Erst mit der Gründung der Volksrepublik starb diese Tradition langsam aus. Auf dem Land jedoch ist die Eheanbahnung als prosperierende Industrie im vergangenen Jahrzehnt wiedererstanden, als Reaktion auf die bittere Realität des Wanderarbeiterlebens. Auch in dieser Hinsicht ist 2020 ein Ausnahmejahr: Die Zufahrten zu vielen Kleinstädten und Dörfern sind blockiert, um die Ansteckung mit dem Coronavirus zu verhindern. So fällt auch die Ehevermittlung in diesem Jahr aus.\nDie Blind-Date-Industrie floriert auch deshalb auf dem Land, weil das Verhältnis weiblicher Geburten zu männlichen in China ein deutliches Ungleichgewicht zugunsten der Jungen hat. China rangiert im aktuellen Global Gender Gap Index auf Platz 106 von 153 Staaten: Die Abtreibung weiblicher Föten oder gar die Tötung weiblicher Neugeborenen ist in manchen Gegenden so weit verbreitet, dass junge Männer kaum noch Partnerinnen finden. Die professionelle Eheanbahnung wurde so ein Ding der Notwendigkeit, nur die kommerziellen Institute haben die Zeit, nach den wenigen Mädchen zu suchen.\nViele Berichte schildern die sehr direkten Auswahlverfahren, mit denen diese Dates arrangiert werden. An einem hektischen Tag kann eine junge Frau schon einmal mit mehr als einem Dutzend Männern zusammengeführt werden. Dann gilt es, bei den Bewerbern die Auskünfte zu Autos, Häusern, Einkommen, Körpergröße, Aussehen, Charakter einzuholen, unter dem strengen Blick von Eltern und weiterer Verwandtschaft. Es klingt wie ein lachhaftes Einkaufserlebnis: Gattenshopping. Allerdings ist angesichts des geringen Status einer Ehefrau auf dem Dorf und des Mangels institutionellen Schutzes vor häuslicher Gewalt die Ehe für Frauen eine riskante und mit vielen Pflichten belastete Angelegenheit. Die schlaueren Mädchen nehmen sich einen Mann mit älteren Schwestern, weil diese auf dem Land normalerweise verpflichtet sind, den jüngeren Bruder finanziell zu unterstützen. Sehr tapfere junge Frauen weigern sich zu heiraten, andere gehen in die Stadt und arbeiten hart für ihre finanzielle Unabhängigkeit. Doch während des Frühlingsfests reisen selbst diese rebellischen Frauen zurück zu den Eltern und bringen ihnen Geld und Geschenke.\nAb dem dritten Tag des Mond-Neujahrs kehren die Menschen nach und nach an ihre Arbeitsplätze zurück. Noch einmal die hektischen Bemühungen, den Bus, Zug oder Flug zu bekommen, jetzt aber im Zustand des Essenskomas. Manche sind traurig, die meisten eher erleichtert. Ich habe immer zu dieser letzteren Mehrheit gehört. Schließlich sind die meisten von uns ja mit gutem Grund für Studium und Job in die größeren Städte gezogen. Freiheit und Unabhängigkeit sind verführerisch.\nIch habe viele alte Gedichte über das Frühlingsfest gelesen, von Dichtern, die ihre Heimatorte verlassen hatten. Die meisten beschreiben Trauer und Heimweh. Traditionelle Chinesen haben das Verlassen der Heimat stets als größte Tragödie im Leben gesehen. Offensichtlich hat sich China doch verändert, aller scheinbaren Nostalgie für eine glorreiche, aber versteinerte Vergangenheit zum Trotz. Es werden immer mehr, die sich mit dem modernen Geist des Dichters Meng Haoran aus der Tang-Dynastie identifizieren: \"Ich treibe durch die Welt und habe mein Vergnügen, wo immer ich bin, kümmere mich nicht um die alten Jahre, die vorbeigezogen sind\" (客行随处乐，不见度年年).\nIn Zeiten der Bedrohung durch die Seuche ist es sogar mit diesem Vergnügen vorbei. Übrig geblieben ist nur ein Gefühl von Hilflosigkeit und Wut auf eine Regierung, die ihre Bürgerinnen und Bürger nicht schützt, sondern bewusst niedertrampelt.\nÜbersetzung: Robert Meyer\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus-related risk low for U.S. life and health insurers. New York(Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - The U.S. insurance industry is closely watching the spread of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV in China but it is too early to tell if its occurrence in the U.S. mainland will evolve into a major risk for domestic life and health insurers, experts said.\nThe Trump administration has declared the coronavirus outbreak as a public health emergency and has implemented precautionary measures to contain its spread{here}.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) made the announcement about the deadly virus a day after the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a “Pandemic Health Emergency of International Concern” on Jan 30. The HHS is now making more than $250 million available in emergency funds to cover the cost of the response.\nAlthough health insurers normally incorporate mortality risk associated with seasonal influenza into their premium rates, they do not typically incorporate an expectation for epidemics or pandemics.\nRating agency Fitch said it does not currently anticipate the arrival of 2019-nCoV in the United States to significantly affect the credit profile of the domestic health insurance sector. Such an outcome would be similar to that of the last two pandemics - the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nBoth SARS, in 2003, and MERS, in 2012, which together resulted in over 1,500 deaths worldwide and had infected over 10,000 people globally, had minimal spread and no fatalities in the United States where the disease was met with containment efforts by public health officials.\nThere have been 11 confirmed cases of people carrying the 2019-nCoV in the United States, while 82 more people remain under investigation as of Feb. 3, according to the CDC{here}. More cases of human transmission are expected to surface over the next few days but all those affected are being quarantined and treated.\nLittle detail is now available on the cost of treating the illness and the severity of associated symptoms. Fitch said it will closely monitor the progress of 2019-nCoV, given its rapid transmission.\nLife insurers with a mortality focus would be at greatest risk if the spread accelerates, Fitch said in a separate note.\n“To-date, 2019-nCoV has not caused any deaths in the U.S. However, any event that might cause an increase in the U.S. mortality rate has the potential to be a negative credit event for U.S. life insurers in a severe scenario,” Donald Thorpe, Senior Director of Insurance Ratings, said in the note.\nThe American Council of Life Insurers maintained that the industry’s capital reserves will help it cope with a potential health crisis with large volumes of claims. Assets of U.S. life insurers were $7 trillion in 2018, down 2.7 percent from the year before.\n“How far the coronavirus outbreak will reach remains unknown, but life insurers are prepared to meet their commitments to policyholders,” council spokesman Whit Cornman said.\nThe HHS has partnered with a New York-based biotech company, Regeneron to develop a treatment. Travel to and from China has been restricted after cases of human-to-human transmission were confirmed.\n*To read more by the Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence team click here: bit.ly/TR-RegIntel\n(By Antonita Madonna in New York, Regulatory Intelligence)\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: Philippines wants to postpone ASEAN para games.

Over the next few days, Covid-19 scare struck twice as two more students who returned from China to Kerala were tested positive for the infection.\nThe news of positive cases triggered a mixed response from the country. While some feared the worst, there were quite a few who were confident about Kerala's success story in similar events such as the outbreak of Nipah. In the end, the state health department ensured that all three positive cases walked out of the hospitals completely cured.\nThe first patient to be tested positive was a 20-year-old student hailing from Thrissur. She had been studying in one of the universities in Wuhan for some years now. She returned to Kerala on January 24 after the situation in Wuhan deteriorated. During screenings at the airport, she could not identify any symptoms and be allowed to go home.\nHowever, the student was being constantly monitored by the Kerala state health authorities.

A shortage of medical masks used to protect healthcare workers in South Africa against TB could run out in the next six months because of the high demand brought on by the coronavirus outbreak.\nOver the past seven weeks, the virus — named COVID-19 — has spread to 25 countries. As the outbreak grows and new cases mount into the tens of thousands, global attention turned to China and, along with it, resources.\nThe mask most effective at protecting Chinese healthcare workers from contracting the virus, however, is also the only mask used to protect healthcare workers in South Africa from TB. But a spike in global demand for the product is outstripping manufacturers' ability to produce the masks here and abroad.\nCurrently, the World Health Organisation says there is a six-month backlog in mask orders globally. Already behind in production, manufacturers are unlikely to be able to catch up as long as the outbreak rages and future orders of the masks could be delayed or only partially filled.\nEither way, countries like South Africa that need the masks for TB are unlikely to get what they need when they need it.\nTB remains the leading cause of death in South Africa, according to 2016 data from Statistics South Africa.

The company is trying to quickly scale-up production alongside smaller local firms such as Greenline Distributors and U-Mask.\nSimilarly, in East London, German mask manufacturer Dräger usually produces around 20 000 to 50 000 masks a month at their factory. However, their order requests have soared to one-million, says Quinton Taylor, product manager for Dräger South Africa.\n\"Our production facilities are aimed at the southern African market, it’s not aimed anywhere near being able to produce a mask for someone that wants a million masks,\" says Taylor.\n\"Everyone is trying to order more material [for the masks]. The guys that manufacture the material are eventually going to run out with the numbers that are coming through. It's inevitable.\"\nOutbreak overseas could endanger the fight against a local killer\nAlmost two months into the COVID-19 outbreak, the bulk of the world’s more than 74 000 cases remain in China. The World Health Organisation (WHO) is working with manufacturers and distributors to ensure the country has enough masks — particularly for its healthcare workers, who are at the most significant risk of infection.\nWith China taking priority, there is likely to be shortages in the masks elsewhere in coming months. Meanwhile, mounting backlogs in orders amid increasing demand and a looming shortage in the materials used in the masks are also likely to jeopardise supply.\nThis could be bad news for South Africa’s fight against TB.\nThe respirators masks, which come in two different shapes, are the only masks that are proven to help prevent the transmission of TB. The devices are a lifeline for South African doctors and nurses who are at high risk of contracting TB from patients.\nALSO READ: SA man suspected of having coronavirus cleared and ready to be discharged\nIdeally, the masks are just one way hospitals and clinics are supposed to help protect healthcare workers from contracting the airborne-disease, including ensuring rooms are well ventilated to ensuring that health facilities are designed to limit transmission.\nFor example, some clinics and hospitals have introduced covered, outdoor waiting areas for TB patients.  But, says University of Cape Town professor Keertan Dheda, extra measures like these are rarely taken.\n\"In most public and private healthcare facilities, these controls are not properly in place, and so the [mask] becomes quite an important protective measure,\" he explains.\nIf South Africa runs short of these masks, there is no alternative.\nDheda warns: \"The lack of these masks will have a substantial impact on increasing the risk of healthcare workers.\"\n*  Correction: 24 February.

A China tem de fazer mudanças profundas no sistema de resposta a emergências de saúde pública, afirmou o Presidente Xi Jinping esta sexta-feira, numa reunião com responsáveis de topo do Partido Comunista Chinês (PCC) em Pequim, enquanto o país continua a debater-se com a crise do novo coronavírus, que deixou os cidadãos à beira de um ataque de nervos e a economia paralisada.\nXi admitiu que o PCC tem de resolver uma série de problemas, falhas e fraquezas que afectaram ao coronavírus. Falou na necessidade de rever as leis relativas à prevenção e tratamento de doenças infecciosas e protecção da vida selvagem (tráfico e consumo de animais selvagens), e sublinhou a necessidade de redigir uma lei de biossegurança, relata o jornal de Hong Kong South China Morning Post.\nFê-lo depois de uma “purga” de altos responsáveis do partido em Wuhan, a cidade onde o novo vírus surgiu. Só nesta sexta-feira houve 5090 novos casos desta infecção na China continental e foram contabilizados 121 mortos. O número total de infectados já ultrapassa os 63 mil e as mortes mais de 1380. Foi também o dia em que a doença foi confirmada, pela primeira vez, em África - o Egipto registou o primeiro caso, um estrangeiro.\n“Não há preparação suficiente para uma catástrofe. Análises de risco, investigação e gestão pormenorizada de emergência não estão disponíveis. Os sistemas de monitorização e de alerta precoce não são adequados e as bases da gestão de emergências têm de ser reforçadas”, disse o Presidente, que é também secretário-geral do PCC, de acordo com o South China Morning Post. A emergência do coronavírus, continuou, “é um grande teste ao nosso sistema e capacidade de governação”. \nA admissão de Xi foi a mais forte até agora sobre as falhas do sistema de emergência chinês desde o início do surto na província de Wuhan, em Dezembro. Xi Jinping viu-se obrigado a liderar a resposta à crise, após uma primeira fase em que se manteve na retaguarda. Foi obrigado a isso, devido à forte reacção internacional à forma como a crise estava a ser gerida, e a maneira como os próprios cidadãos chineses reagiam, nas redes sociais, à falta de informação sobre as quarentenas em massa impostas em 16 cidades na província de Hubei, com um total de 56 milhões de habitantes. Quanto mais o surto durar, mais prejudicada ficará a credibilidade do regime. ​\nUm sinal que se espera revelador dessa nova atitude foi o anúncio, pela primeira vez, esta sexta-feira, do número de profissionais de saúde infectados com coronavírus na China: 1716, dos quais seis morreram. “Os profissionais de saúde enfrentam o desafio de cuidar de um número substancial de pacientes em Wuhan. É preocupante saber que muitos foram infectados”, disse ao New York Times Benjamin Cowling, professor de Epidemiologia da Universidade de Hong Kong.\nA televisão chinesa anunciou entretanto que qualquer pessoa que esteja a regressar a Pequim, de outra parte do país, terá de ficar em isolamento durante 14 dias. Quem não cumprir esta obrigação “terá de responder de acordo com a lei”, diz o New York Times. O comunicado foi emitido por um “grupo de líderes” do PCC ao nível municipal, e não pela liderança nacional. \nA China hesita entre o relançamento da economia e o combate sem tréguas ao novo vírus. Após o fim do período de férias do Ano Novo Chinês, as pessoas regressam aos locais de trabalho, mas é preciso garantir que não trazem a infecção consigo. É obrigatório usar protecções para evitar transmitir o vírus aos colegas - por isso vêem-se trabalhadores envolvidos em plástico dos pés à cabeça, e com máscaras. \nOs epidemiologistas chineses acreditam que o pico do surto será nas próximas semanas, mas há quem avise que não se pode avançar com uma data. \"Este surto ainda pode avançar em qualquer direcção”, disse Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-geral da Organização Mundial de Saúde. \nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\n\"Apesar de as autoridades chinesas estarem a fazer o seu melhor, com base nas actuais tendências de casos confirmados, há uma clara indicação de que as medidas que aplicaram até agora fizeram muito pouco, muito tarde”, disse à Reuters Adam Kamradt-Scott, especialista em doenças infecciosas no Centre for International Security Studies da Universidade de Sydney, na Austrália. \nNão se espera que exista uma vacina antes de 18 meses - devido aos constrangimentos próprios de produção das vacinas.

However, with more and more COVID-19 cases popping up around the world, he chose to do the responsible thing and quarantine himself at home in Taiwan despite no longer displaying any symptoms himself. \n His decision led him to quit his role as a judge on the latest season of Chinese singing reality competition The Treasured Voice, 'cos hey, better safe than sorry, right? \n Leehom then fondly recalled the iconic 2003 song he and a few others wrote to encourage those battling SARS, called ‘Hand in Hand’. “To this day, that is still the most meaningful song in my entire career,” he mused. “It made me realise that music can truly be food for the soul.” \n While he may not have written any new tunes for COVID-19, Leehom has still done his part by reminding his followers to continue washing their hands and practise social distancing while going through this tough time together. \n “After this is all over, we will definitely meet again,” he promised. \n Photos: Wang Leehom/Instagram, Wang Leehom/Weibo \n "}, {"content": "China: Coronavirus death toll spikes to 425.

Wie die Gesundheitskommission in Peking mitteilte, ging die Zahl neu bestätigter Infektionen auf 394 Fälle zurück, nachdem es am Vortag noch 1.749 gewesen waren. Die Zahl neuer Todesopfer wurde mit 114 angegeben. Auch in Hubei gingen die neuen Infektionen im Vergleich zum Vortag von 1.649 auf 349 zurück. Mehrere Städte meldeten auch negative Zahlen bei den neuen Infektionen.\nDer starke Rückgang der Viruserkrankungen ist auf ein angepasstes Diagnoseverfahren zurückzuführen. Laut der Gesundheitskommission sollen klinische Diagnosen nicht mehr als offiziell bestätige Fälle in die Statistik einfließen. Die besonders betroffene Provinz Hubei, wo das Virus ursprünglich in der Millionenstadt Wuhan ausgebrochen war, hatte vergangene Woche damit begonnen, auch solche Diagnosen zu zählen, die auf einer Kombination von Faktoren wie etwa Lungenbildern und dem körperlichen Zustand beruhen. Nun sollen auch dort nur Labortests maßgeblich sein, die aber laut Experten in der Vergangenheit auch offensichtliche Erkrankungen nicht immer gleich erkannt haben.\nInsgesamt haben in China nach den offiziellen Angaben bislang 74.576 Menschen die Covid-19 genannte Lungenkrankheit, die vom Coronavirus ausgelöst wird. Experten gehen jedoch von einer hohen Dunkelziffer aus.\nTrotz der rückläufigen Zahlen warnte ein führender chinesischer Wissenschaftler davor, dass das Coronavirus zu einer etablierten Krankheit wie die Influenza-Grippe werden könnte. \"Das neue Coronavirus könnte zu einer Langzeitkrankheit werden, die genau wie die Grippe mit dem Menschen koexistiert\", sagte Wang Chen, Präsident der China Academy of Medical Science, im chinesischen Staatsfernsehen.\nSüdkorea meldete hingegen einen deutlichen Anstieg der Coronavirus-Infizierten.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared on Wednesday that the coronavirus outbreak could now be characterised as a \"pandemic\". The declaration came as the coronavirus cases are sharply increasing around the world.\nThe WHO also added that Italy and Iran were now on the frontline of the disease and other countries would soon join them.\n\"We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterised as a pandemic,\" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nThe WHO chief, however, maintained that the designation of the coronavirus as a pandemic did not mean the situation was hopeless. \"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic,\" he said.\nAddressing a news conference on Wednesday, the WHO chief urged the global community to redouble efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, saying aggressive measures could still play a big role to curb it.\n\"We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action. We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nThe outbreak of coronavirus was declared as a pandemic as the United States stocks plunged into bear market territory and several American cities joined European counterparts in banning large gatherings due to the alarming levels of its spread.\nWHAT IS A PANDEMIC\nA pandemic is a worldwide spread of a disease or an infection. The term is associated with the geographic spread and not any characteristic changes in the infection itself.\nWHO officials have signalled for weeks that they may use \"pandemic\" as a descriptive term but added that it does not carry any legal significance. The WHO no longer has a category for declaring a pandemic, except for influenza. The novel coronavirus is not the flu.\nHowever, the term should not be confused with an outbreak and an epidemic.\nHOW IS PANDEMIC DIFFERENT FROM EPIDEMIC\nEpidemic comparatively affects fewer number of people and is confined to a certain region. An outbreak is usually the first stages of an epidemic. An epidemic affects a region or a country and starts infecting a large part of the population.\nThe word epidemic originates from the Greek word 'epidemia' while the word pandemic originates from the word 'pandemos', which denotes \"all people\".\nThe ebola spread was an epidemic that affected western Africa and resulted in the deaths of thousands over some years. The SARS outbreak in China was also an epidemic that killed over 800 people.\nA pandemic is when a disease rapidly starts spreading across the world and is no longer restricted to a community or region.\nThe world has seen a number of pandemics in the past involving diseases such as plague, influenza, yellow fever and others. The latest pandemic is the first caused by coronavirus.\nMore than 118,000 cases of coronavirus have emerged in 114 countries and 4,291 people have died so far.\nThe coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, halting industries, markets, bringing flights to a standstill, prompting the latest oil price war, locking down entire nations, closing schools and forcing the postponement of events and concerts across the world.\nThe WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, its \"highest level of alarm\", on January 30 when there were fewer than 100 cases of COVID-19 outside China. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the casualties and number of infected persons are expected to rise.\nIn the past two weeks the number of cases outside China had risen 13-fold, and the number of countries affected had tripled, a sombre-looking Tedros said, displaying little of his normally upbeat persona.\n"}, {"content": "China delaying permission to India for sending plane to Wuhan: Official.

SHANGHAI — The food market where China's deadly virus surfaced was a smorgasbord of exotic wildlife ranging from wolf pups to species linked to previous pandemics such as civets, according to vendor information and a Chinese media report. \n The Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan came under greater scrutiny on Wednesday (Jan 22) as Chinese officials said that the virus which has so far killed nine people and infected hundreds may have originated in a wild animal sold at the food emporium. \n Past deadly epidemics have been blamed on wild animals — Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) was linked to Chinese consumption of civet meat — setting Chinese authorities up for potential embarrassment if lax supervision of wildlife trafficking is found at fault in the latest outbreak. \n A price list circulating on China's internet for a business at the Wuhan market lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game — 112 items in all. \n \"Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door,\" said the price list for the vendor, \"Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Masses\". \n Dr Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said in Beijing on Wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. \n China bans the trafficking of a number of wild species or requires special licenses, but regulations are loose for some species if they are commercially farmed. \n AFP was unable to directly confirm the authenticity of the price list. Phone calls to the vendor went unanswered, and attempts to connect to its social media accounts were rejected. \n The Beijing News published a photo Tuesday showing the same vendor's now-shuttered store front, as authorities in white hazmat suits milled about. \n The paper also quoted other merchants as saying trade in wildlife took place up until the market was shuttered for disinfection shortly after the outbreak. \n A number of the early sufferers of the virus, now known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), were employees of the market. \n VIRUS ‘SPILLOVER’ \n Many exotic species are still widely consumed in China or other Asian countries where they are considered a delicacy — like the civet or some rats or bats — or for purported health benefits that are unproven by science. \n But this brings growing human health risks, said Dr Christian Walzer, executive director of the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society's Health Program. \n Dr Walzer said 70 per cent of all new infectious diseases come from wildlife, with habitat encroachment increasing the chances of pathogens spreading. \n \"Wildlife markets offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spill over from wildlife hosts,\" he said. \n \"It is essential to invest resources not only into discovering new viruses, but more importantly, in determining the epidemiological drivers of... (the) spillover, amplification, and spread of infectious diseases.\" \n Bats are thought to have spawned Sars, which in 2002-03 killed hundreds of people in Asia, mostly China. \n Sars was also found in civets in wildlife markets in China, with many scientists believing the bat virus infected the cat-like creatures and then humans who ate them. \n Following Sars, China cracked down on consumption of civets and some other species, but conservationists say the trade continues. \n China has so far won praise for its openness and handling of the current outbreak in stark contrast to Sars, when it was accused of stifling information and failing to cooperate with the rest of the world.

E qual a sua expressão em idade pediátrica? \nHá relato de um caso de um bebé de nove meses infetado por um dos pais, mas não se sabe ainda se o vírus tem afetado crianças do mesmo modo que afeta adultos.\nQual o período de transmissão? \nO pneumologista Filipe Froes lembra que as autoridades chinesas alertaram que pode haver transmissão entre pessoas antes mesmo do início dos sintomas. Não se sabe se é uma exceção ou uma regra e quanto tempo antes de os sintomas se manifestarem pode a doença ser contagiosa. Também se ignora se, à semelhança do que aconteceu com o SARS (sigla inglesa para Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave), se há doentes com maior capacidade de contágio do que outros.\nÉ igualmente desconhecido qual o maior período de transmissão e até quando ocorre.\nQue tratamentos existem? \nAtualmente, os doentes estão a ser tratados com medidas de suporte, que apenas tratam os sintomas da doença, como febre ou dificuldade respiratória. Não há ainda um medicamento específico para este novo coronavírus.\nFilipe Froes indica que haverá tratamentos experimentais em curso, mas ainda se desconhece qual a sua eficácia.\nSegundo o especialista, estará já em desenvolvimento uma vacina, muito com base no trabalho que tinha sido feito para a pneumonia atípica de 2002/2003 - SARS. É ainda necessário aguardar por ensaios sobre a efetividade e segurança.\nQual a origem exata do vírus? \nOs primeiros casos do novo coronavírus em humanos estavam ligados a um mercado de pescado e carne na cidade chinesa de Wuhan. Contudo, não se sabe qual o animal que transmitiu o vírus ao primeiro doente infetado, nem se houve um animal que seja o hospedeiro originário e outro o hospedeiro intermédio.\nO que se sabe então sobre o novo coronavírus?\nOs coronavírus são uma larga família de vírus que vivem noutros animais (por exemplo, aves, morcegos, pequenos mamíferos) e que no ser humano normalmente causam doenças respiratórias, desde uma comum constipação até a casos mais graves, como pneumonias. Podem transmitir-se entre animais e pessoas. A maioria das estirpes de coronavírus circulam entre animais e não chegam sequer a infetar seres humanos. Aliás, até agora, apenas seis estirpes de coronavírus entre os milhares existentes é que passaram a barreira das espécies e atingiram pessoas.\nO novo coronavírus é da mesma família do vírus da Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave (2002-2003) e da Síndrome Respiratória do Médio Oriente (2012).\nEstes dois tipos de coronavírus são até agora os que tiveram capacidade de atravessar a barreira das espécies e de se transmitir a humanos e que apresentam quadros de alguma gravidade, explicou à agência Lusa o pneumologista Filipe Froes.\nOs primeiros casos de 2019-nCoV apareceram em meados de dezembro na cidade chinesa de Whuan, quando começaram a chegar aos hospitais pessoas com uma pneumonia viral. Percebeu-se que todas as pessoas trabalhavam ou visitavam com frequência o mercado de marisco e carnes de Huanan, nessa mesma cidade. Ainda se desconhece a origem exata da infeção, mas terão sido animais infetados, que são comercializados vivos, a transmiti-la aos seres humanos.\nEstes vírus transmitem-se geralmente pela via respiratória e afetam sobretudo o trato respiratório, especialmente os pulmões nas formas graves.\nOs sintomas destes coronavírus são mais intensos do que uma gripe e incluem febre, dor, mal-estar geral e dificuldades respiratórias. Nos casos confirmados inicialmente, 90% apresentaram febre, 80% tosse seca, 20% falta de ar e só cerca de 15% apresentaram dificuldade."}, {"content": "UPDATE 2-Pompeo says China still withholding coronavirus information. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sharpened on Thursday his criticism of China’s handling of a coronavirus pandemic, saying its ruling Communist Party was still denying the world information needed to prevent further cases.\nThe remarks, in an interview with the Washington Watch radio program, provoked a riposte from China that Pompeo should cease “politicizing” the epidemic and defaming the country.\nPompeo had repeated previous charges that Beijing’s delay in sharing information about the virus had created risks to people worldwide that had “truly put thousands of lives at risk.”\n“My concern is that this cover-up, this disinformation that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in, is still denying the world the information it needs so that we can prevent further cases or something like this from recurring again,” he added.\nPompeo also accused Iran and Russia of waging disinformation campaigns about the virus.\n“The disinformation campaign from Russia and Iran as well as China continues,” he said. “They’re talking about it coming from the U.S. Army and they’re saying maybe it began in Italy, all things to deflect responsibility.”\nDespite his strong criticism of China, Pompeo refrained from referring to the virus as the “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan virus,” labels that have angered Beijing and which he has used repeatedly.\n“The time will come for recriminations,” he said, but added it was important for the world to know what was really going on.\n“This is an ongoing global crisis, and we need to make sure that every country today is being transparent, sharing what’s really going on, so that the global community, the global health care, infectious disease community can begin to work on this in a holistic way.”\nIn Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China had been transparent and shared information with the World Health Organization and other countries, including the United States.\n“We urge the U.S. to cease politicizing the epidemic, and cease attacking and defaming China,” Geng told a daily news conference.\nPompeo, a persistent critic of Beijing and the Communist Party, said “very important decisions” would have to be made in future about how the U.S.-China relationship was structured.\nHe added that supply-chain challenges faced in the United States were due to companies “operating their supply chains out of China but not here in the United States.”\nPompeo did not elaborate, but U.S. officials said last week the White House was preparing an executive order to help relocate medical supply chains from China and elsewhere overseas to the United States amid the pandemic.\nThe proposed U.S. push has sparked concern in China and elsewhere, although it is unclear when Trump might act.\nThe United States “should never be reliant on a foreign country for the means of our own survival,” Trump said at a daily briefing of his coronavirus task force.\n“Our goal for the future must be to have American medicine for American patients, American supplies for American hospitals...”\n(Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: open tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 in an external browser.)\n"}, {"content": "china to see strong economic rebound after coronavirus, chinese envoy to canada says. OTTAWA - China's ambassador to Canada said on Wednesday that world's second-biggest economy will bounce back quickly once the new coronavirus outbreak has passed because it is still fundamentally healthy.  \n \"The impact on the Chinese economy will be temporary and short lived,\" Cong Peiwu told Reuters. China's economic fundamentals remain robust and consumer spending and production have only been delayed, he said.  \n \"Hopefully across the nation we'll see a strong rebound in the not-too-distant future,\" he said.  \n The comments come as the number of new daily infections from the COVID-19 virus is increasing outside of China faster than inside, and that follows crippling Chinese restrictions imposed to stop its spread, including transport suspensions and the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday.  \n Mainland China had 119 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said, down from 125 the previous day, in a broad trend that has seen numbers of new cases fall from the middle of February.  \n \"After several weeks of fighting against this disease, the message is that COVID-19 is a virus that can be contained,\" Peiwu said. \"It's a common challenge. We have to fight against the disease together.\"  \n Canada has only seen about 30 cases so far, and no deaths. Peiwu praised the country for not over-reacting and being \"clear-headed and evidence based\", while Beijing has accused the United States of scaremongering for its quick evacuations and travel restrictions.  \n However, Canada's measured reaction has not paved the way for a resolution to the long-running dispute between the two nations, which started in December 2018 when Canadian police arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, on a U.S. arrest warrant.  \n Shortly afterward, Beijing detained two Canadian men who were later charged for spying and are still being held.  \n \"Of course, there's still an outstanding issue between the two countries,\" Peiwu said.  \n The first phase of the legal battle over whether Meng should be extradited to the United States wrapped up in January. China has repeatedly demanded that Ottawa release her, but the Canadian government says it will not interfere in the judicial process.  \n \"It's our consistent hope that the Canadian side will make the right decision,\" the ambassador said.

VIENTIANE (Reuters) - China called for solidarity on Thursday in a special meeting called to discuss the coronavirus outbreak with Southeast Asian nations, as Beijing faces criticism for its handling of the epidemic.\nThe hastily called gathering in Laos suggested China is seeking support from its smaller neighbours, which have received billions of dollars in Chinese investment and infrastructure in recent years as a key part of its Belt and Road Initiative.\nASEAN foreign ministers joined hands with their Chinese counterpart Wang Yi during the meeting and shouted “Stay strong, Wuhan! Stay strong, China! Stay strong, ASEAN!”. Wuhan is the Chinese city at the epicentre of the outbreak.\n“Fear is more threatening than the virus and confidence is more precious than gold,” Wang told a news conference after the meeting, which started with the playing of a video clip of Southeast Asian leaders expressing their support for China.\nIn remarks during a welcome dinner on Wednesday evening, Wang was quoted by the Chinese Foreign Ministry as saying support from ASEAN countries and others “made us feel that this winter is not that cold and spring is coming”.\nAnalysts said Beijing was seeking expressions of support after it was taken to task for its handling of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which has killed more than 2,100 people.\n“China is promoting a message of friendships in ASEAN to counter the attack from the West that it has been handling the outbreak poorly,” said Alfred M. Wu, associate professor in the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.\nASEAN and China, its largest trading partner, have an annual travel flow of more than 65 million visits, and many ASEAN economies are reliant on Chinese tourist receipts. ASEAN nations collectively are also China’s second-largest trading partner.\nBut travel restrictions to prevent the spread of the disease have idled much of the world’s No. 2 economy and choked key elements of President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of railways, ports and highways..\n“Countries’ responses to the coronavirus have become somewhat of a litmus test for friendship,” said Tom Baxter, an independent researcher on China’s BRI.\n“In ASEAN, responses seem quite divided between countries. The two that seem to have most obviously come out with a display of friendship are Cambodia and Laos,” he said, noting the open-door practices of China’s known allies.\nIn contrast, Singapore has imposed an outright ban, and the Philippines has barred all foreign nationals coming from China, Hong Kong and Macau. Malaysia has imposed a temporary travel ban on arrivals from all Chinese provinces that have been placed under lockdown by the Chinese government.\nEven as the meeting kicked off, Thailand on Thursday issued a travel advisory urging citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China and advised those already there to leave, hinting that flights to China could be further restricted.\nEasing travel restrictions was one of the main issues Wang discussed with his counterparts during private bilateral meetings late into Wednesday, according to press statements from the Chinese foreign ministry.\nIn a Wednesday night meeting with Singapore’s foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, Wang said Beijing was worried about Singapore’s “restrictive measures” and hoped “normal exchanges between the two countries can be resumed as soon as possible.”\n"}, {"content": "Evidence Wuhan virus can be passed from person to person as infections in China exceed 200. MELBOURNE (BLOOMBERG) - A pneumonia outbreak in central China widened with more than 200 people now diagnosed with the new Sars-like virus, as health experts said there is now evidence that the illness is spreading from people to people. \n With increased searching and testing for the novel virus among people with symptoms like fever and coughing, the number of cases in China surged over the weekend. Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, now has almost 200 confirmed cases, with three fatalities. Cases were also reported in Beijing and the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. \n Across the region, South Korea detected its first case, according to news agency Yonhap, adding to those found in Thailand and Japan last week. \n The surge in cases, after the World Health Organisation (WHO) released guidance for diagnostic detection of the virus on Friday (Jan 17), confirmed suspicions that the illness is being spread from people to people. There are no reports yet of health-care workers being infected, a sign that the virus is likely not as infectious as Sars, which killed almost 800 people 17 years ago. \n \"It is clear that there is at least some human-to-human transmission from the evidence we have, but we don't have clear evidence that shows the virus has acquired the capacity to transmit among humans easily,\" said Dr Takeshi Kasai, the WHO's regional director for the western pacific, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday. \n \"We need more information to analyse that.\" \n Countries across the world stepped up screening among arriving passengers ahead of the Chinese New Year festival that starts this Friday, a period of heightened travel for Chinese people. International airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco started screening from late Friday, joining cities in Asia that implemented the surveillance measure days after the outbreak was reported on Dec 31. \n In Wuhan, health-care workers spread out across the city of 11 million, screening for symptoms among people on planes and at railway stations. \n \"This is a situation where we're going to see additional cases all around the world as folks look for it more,\" Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the US's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on Friday. \n \"It's highly plausible that there will be at least a case in the United States, and that's the reason that we're moving forward so quickly with this screening.\" \n It's possible that more than 1,700 people in Wuhan have been infected with the virus, Prof Neil Ferguson and colleagues at Imperial College London said in a study on Friday. Their analysis was based on cases reported outside China last week, with the assumption that it takes five or six days for someone to feel unwell after being infected, and another four or five days for the infection to be detected. \n The widening of cases sparked a rally in Chinese drugmakers' shares on Monday. Antibiotic makers Jiangsu Lianhuan Pharmaceutical Co, Shandong Lukang Pharmaceutical Co and Shenzhen Neptunus Bioengineering Co all rose by the 10 per cent daily limit in early trading. \n Shares of companies in the travel and hotel sectors dropped on fears of a hit to tourism over the Lunar New Year, traditionally a peak period of spending for China's billion-strong consumer force. Chinese airlines and Macau casino operators were among the biggest losers on Monday, with Air China Ltd sinking as much as 7.8 per cent in Hong Kong. \n The novel coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, has triggered alarm because of similarities with the one that sparked Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or Sars, 17 years ago. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people, and others that circulate among animal, including camels, cats, and bats, the CDC said. While rare, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people, and then spread between people. \n The source and transmission routes of the 2019-nCov virus are still unknown, China's National Health Commission said in a statement on Sunday. \n Some of the first group of patients in Wuhan worked or shopped at a seafood market where live animals and wildlife parts were also reportedly sold. \n The closed Huanan seafood wholesale market associated with the Wuhan virus cluster. PHOTO: EPA-EFE \n Provincial health authorities in Guangdong confirmed a case on Sunday in a 66-year-old Shenzhen resident who developed fever and fatigue on Jan 3 during a five-day trip to Wuhan. \n Two cases have been confirmed in Beijing, according to a statement by a local health authority on Monday. The patients, who have a history of travel to Wuhan, have been hospitalised and are in stable condition. \n Officials in Thailand reported two cases last week, while Japan confirmed a case on Thursday. All of them either lived in Wuhan or had spent time there, though none was linked to the seafood market. \n Health authorities said that as of 10pm on Sunday, 25 of the city's 198 cases had been cured. A further three had been discharged from the hospital. Currently, 170 cases are being treated in isolation wards at various hospitals, of which 126 cases are mild, 35 are severe, and nine cases are critically ill. \n Of the 136 patients reported over the weekend, 66 were male and 70 were female; the youngest was 25 years old and the oldest was 89. The most recent illness occurred before Saturday, and initial symptoms were mostly fever, cough or chest tightness, and difficulty breathing. \n Chinese authorities said the outbreak is \"still preventable and controllable\", in an attempt to reassure the public as hundreds of millions of people prepare to travel ahead of the country's biggest annual festivities. \n "}, {"content": "Asian shares ease off three-week highs as coronavirus fears return.

SHANGHAI - Chinese scientists and health experts involved in the country's fight against the coronavirus believe the worst is now over, downplaying warnings that the disease could become seasonal or that a deadlier \"second wave\" could hit later in the year.  \n As the pandemic continues to spread overseas, a growing number of countries are bracing themselves for a worst-case scenario in which COVID-19 remains in circulation until next year at the earliest.  \n But medical advisers in China have expressed confidence that the country's strict containment measures have done enough to ensure that the outbreak can be brought under complete control, domestically at least, within weeks.  \n Though they remain wary of the risks of \"importing\" cases from overseas, they say China should be capable of eliminating COVID-19 in the same way it eliminated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. SARS was eventually contained after the government imposed stringent screening and quarantine measures.  \n \"For me, a second outbreak (of coronavirus), a domestic outbreak in China, wouldn't be a great concern,\" said Cao Wei, deputy director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital.  \n She told a briefing on Monday that while China needed another month to make a final judgment, the existing prevention and control measures should be enough to bring the epidemic to an end domestically.  \n The World Health Organization has said the coronavirus reached a peak in China around late February. Zhong Nanshan, a senior government adviser who helped detect and defeat SARS in 2003, said it \"could be over by June\" if other countries take the required action.  \n On Wednesday, there were no new domestic cases in the disease's epicentre of Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began. However, \"imported\" infections reached a record 34, and have outnumbered domestic transmissions for five consecutive days.  \n Ian Henderson, director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at the University of Queensland, said China's actions to contain the virus have been \"extraordinary\" but there could be a second outbreak, this time imported.  \n \"(What) remains possible is that as controls around isolation are relaxed in China, with a population that is still susceptible, then the virus may resurge if it has not been eradicated elsewhere,\" he said.  \n  \n DONE \"99 OUT OF 100\"  \n Gao Zhengliang, vice-director of the China Cell Biology Institute told the official Youth Daily newspaper that the country had now completed \"99 out of 100 steps\" required to defeat the coronavirus, though he warned that if global infections spiralled out of control, \"the costs and sacrifices China has made will be downgraded.\"  \n Some experts have referred to the infection patterns of the devastating 1918-19 influenza epidemic that killed more than 50 million people during three different waves, with the second the deadliest. However, Henderson said it was important to recognise the current virus was different from influenza.  \n Global inter-connectedness means that instead of coming in waves, new viruses are now more likely to spread and circulate until they mutate or until a certain level of immunity is reached. One crucial issue is how long a previously infected patient remains immune.  \n \"The number one point to get across is that in terms of the behaviour of this virus we are still very much in the dark,\" Henderson said. \"The issue around protective immunity is difficult to answer because we simply do not have sufficient information.\"  \n Some experts have raised the possibility that COVID-19 could become an entrenched seasonal illness along with ordinary influenza.  \n Preliminary studies have shown a possible correlation between the epidemic and climate patterns. A paper produced by researchers in Europe this week said the coronavirus preferred cool and dry conditions which could lead to seasonal global outbreaks \"much like other respiratory diseases\".  \n However, there have still been cases in warmer and more humid climates in southeast Asian countries, including Thailand and Singapore.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has been one of many to suggest that COVID-19 could go away of its own accord as temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere.  \n However, Marc Lipsitch, a communicable disease expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said while warmer and wetter weather could reduce the contagiousness of the coronavirus, \"it is not reasonable to expect those declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent.\"  \n Gao of the China Cell Biology Institute said given the higher fatality rate for the coronavirus, relaxing curbs was not an option.  \n \"The resolute curbs on the coronavirus must be continued, it absolutely cannot be allowed to co-exist with humans in the same way as the influenza virus.\" REUTERS \n "}, {"content": "UPDATE 1-Cargill bans international travel for staff amid coronavirus outbreak.

Die Covid-19-Pandemie mit rapide steigender Zahl von Infizierten und Toten zeigt immer mehr Parallelen mit Katastrophenszenarien „Made in Hollywood“. Und das Coronavirus lehrt die Entertainment-Branche jetzt das Fürchten.\nAusgerechnet Hollywood-Liebling Tom Hanks und seine Ehefrau Rita Wilson überraschten als erstes Promi-Paar mit der Nachricht, dass sie beide mit Sars-CoV-2 infiziert sind. Der Unterhaltungsbetrieb liegt quasi lahm. Film- und TV-Produktionen werden gestoppt, Kinostarts weltweit abgesagt, Messen und Festivals gecancelt. Branchenexperten rechnen mit Kinokasseneinbußen von bis zu 20 Milliarden Dollar in diesem Jahr, wenn sich der Stillstand über mehrere Monate hinzieht.\nDer erste Einbruch kam schon im Januar mit der Schließung der Kinos in China, dem Ursprungsland des neuartigen Virus, zugleich der zweitgrößte Kinomarkt nach USA und Kanada. Im Februar dann das vorläufige Aus für Tom Cruise und „Mission: Impossible 7“. Drei Wochen lang wollte Regisseur Christopher McQuarrie in Italien drehen, wo schon das Virus grassierte.\nEs geht Schlag auf Schlag weiter: Anfang März wird der Start des neuen James-Bond-Films „No Time to Die“ um sieben Monate auf November verschoben - „nach sorgfältiger Überlegung und gründlicher Bewertung des weltweiten Kinomarktes“, so die nüchterne Begründung. Wegen des Coronavirus war zuvor schon die gesamte Werbetour in China abgesagt worden.\nIn den letzten Tagen trifft es weitere Blockbuster: \"Fast & Furious 9\", \"The New Mutants\", \"Mulan\", \"Peter Hase 2\", \"A Quiet Place 2\". Fans müssen sich nun länger gedulden, bis diese Filme ins Kino kommen. John Krasinski, Regisseur des Horrorfilms \"A Quiet Place 2\", kommentierte den Aufschub auf Instagram. Seinen Film sollte man zusammen mit anderen Leuten im Kino erleben. \"Jetzt ist offensichtlich nicht die richtige Zeit dafür.\" Nach China, Italien, Polen und Deutschland machen auch in anderen Ländern immer mehr Lichtspielhäuser dicht.\nIn den USA bleiben die meisten Kinos vorerst noch geöffnet, doch sie geben nur die Hälfte der Tickets aus, um mehr Platz und damit mehr Abstand zwischen den Besuchern zu schaffen. Die Hollywoodstudios setzen die Empfehlung „Social Distancing“, also auf Distanz zueinander gehen, um Ansteckungen zu vermeiden, radikal um.\nDas Disney-Studio gab am Freitag einen massiven Drehstopp bekannt, Begegnungen am Set werden damit vermieden. Betroffen sind unter anderem Großprojekte wie „The Little Mermaid“, Guillermo del Toros „Nightmare Alley“ und Ridley Scotts Historiendrama „The Last Duel“ mit Matt Damon und Ben Affleck. Ende Februar hatten die Dreharbeiten für „Jurassic World: Dominion“ in Hawaii begonnen, nun wird das Set bis auf weiteres geschlossen, gaben die Universal Studios bekannt. Für „The Batman“ kam am Samstag die Zwangspause. Warner Bros. will den seit Januar laufenden Dreh in England mit Hauptdarsteller Robert Pattinson für mindestens zwei Wochen unterbrechen.\nAuch der Streaming-Dienst Netflix kündigte an, vorsichtshalber mindestens für zwei Wochen die Produktion von Filmen und TV-Shows in den USA und Kanada einstellen.\nDer positive Coronavirus-Test bei Tom Hanks hatte am Set in Australien zum sofortigen Abbruch der neuen Produktion von Regisseur Baz Luhrmann geführt. Das Biopic vom Studio Warner Bros. ist eine noch titellose Filmbiografie über die Rock'n'Roll-Legende Elvis Presley, in der Hanks dessen Manager Colonel Tom Parker spielt. Der zweifache Oscar-Preisträger und seine Frau hatten die Diagnose am Donnerstag in den sozialen Medien bekannt gegeben. Sie seien nun in Quarantäne und würden „jeden Tag nehmen, wie er kommt“, gab Hanks betont locker von sich.\nBranchenexperten in Hollywood geben unterdessen eine düstere Prognose. Sie rechnen schon die möglichen Milliardenverluste durch die Corona-Krise hoch. 20 Milliarden Dollar könnten allein an den Kinokassen in diesem Jahr fehlen, vor allem, wenn die lukrativen ausländischen Märkte einbrechen, berichtete am Freitag das Filmblatt „Hollywood Reporter“. 2019 flossen weltweit noch mehr als 42 Milliarden Dollar in Hollywoods Kassen.\nAbgesagt ist auch schon die jährliche Fachmesse CinemaCon, bei der die Filmtheaterbranche Ende März in Las Vegas die neuesten Hollywoodprojekte vorstellen wollte. Auch die renommierten Filmfestivals Tribeca in New York und das Internationale Film Festival in San Francisco (beide für April geplant) sind abgesagt geworden. Das sind schlechte Vorboten für Cannes, wo die 73. Filmfestspiele Mitte Mai (noch) auf dem Plan stehen. Eine Absage würde die schon kränkelnde internationale Branche schwer treffen.

Although it may feel like ages, we are still in the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak caused by a new coronavirus.   \n As two old hands who experienced the struggles of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) pandemic in Singapore, we are gratified to see that preparedness systems are in place here and working well.  \n The measures introduced have even been endorsed by infectious disease experts such as the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine’s Professor David Heymann, who noted that despite causing inconveniences, Singapore “is not overdoing it”.  \n Nonetheless, a crisis of public confidence is moving faster than the crisis of public health.  \n Masks, hand sanitisers and disinfectants were the first to fly off the shelves. Even in our traditionally stoic society, a breach in our psychological defence occurred when some took to hoarding food and household items once Singapore moved to Dorscon Orange on Feb 7.   \n Can we succeed in beating this virus? The answer is most certainly yes, and we are confident of the reasons why.  \n UNDERSTANDING OUR INSECURITY  \n Insecurity amidst uncertainty is to be expected. Many reports, some untrue, are making their rounds in chat groups, stoking public anxiety, doubt and fear. \n We are sad to see Sars revisited in many ways, with the old unfounded fears of infection prompting members of the public to shun healthcare workers and landlords to throw out tenants who had travelled to China.  \n But Covid-19 is much less deadly than Sars or the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers). Case-fatality rate measures the number of deaths among those infected and this is now coming out consistently to be much lower for Covid-19.   \n On the other hand, this disease is far more capable of transmitting between humans than Sars or Mers. Transmissibility is measured by its reproduction number — cases directly generated from each case — and this is showing to be more like pandemic influenza. \n While social media can be useful, it also means that information can be overstated. Bad news spreads faster than good news. Media, which build in algorithms that prioritise sites similar to those often visited, compound biases in line with previous viewpoints and worsen fear. \n The authorities have been quick to provide timely updates and dispel rumours.   \n But people have different ways to judge the impact for themselves, with some even contemplating the “what-ifs” future state, such as Dorscon Red. Hence, expectations and beliefs honed from prior experience and observation of other countries contribute towards behaviours such as panic buying. \n The verdict on this outbreak is not out yet. Much attention is on the effectiveness of control measures in China. \n Some assess that disease incidence will decline into the warmer months of summer. Others believe Covid-19 will last longer, and possibly become endemic in a way similar to influenza.   \n Whichever the case may be, we can prepare for the worst while hoping for the best.  \n Co-author Leo Yee Sin (right) briefing Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during his visit to NCID on Jan 31, 2020.   Photo: Raj Nadarajan / TODAY \n WHY WE ARE CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS  \n Whether the outbreak lasts weeks or months, halting this outbreak in its tracks ultimately depends not so much on disease duration as on our collective resilience.  \n Sustainability is key to preparing for a long battle. Support for each other is crucial to our psychological defence.  \n When we recall events of 2003, the immediate impact of Sars was fear. But out of this grew one long-lasting positive effect, in the form of a nationwide crash course on the importance of good hygiene practices.   \n Being a compact city state with a high population density, and dependent on global connectivity for our life blood, we have to accept many hard truths.  \n But we are not helpless. There are many actions we can take together to safeguard public health and minimise the impact of acute events that endanger us.   \n Unwelcome as they are, public health emergencies will occur from time to time and they represent opportunities for us to derive valuable information not just about the disease threat, but also about ourselves.   \n Courageous volunteers are offering their skills and support in the community. Scientists are readily sharing knowledge to address the dearth of understanding on how Covid-19 originates and spreads. \n And we have dedicated healthcare and public health professionals, many with experience from Sars.  \n In addition, Singapore's unique size also works in our favour. Many challenges are much more manageable in scale here than they would be in other countries.  \n We have ample resources, invested heavily during peacetime. We also have the will to learn from our mistakes and stand together. \n These assets collectively constitute our urban health security. Hence, we are confident of success. \n COMMUNITY-BASED RESPONSE VITAL  \n New cases are being reported at an alarming rate in many places outside China. As global events unfold, the momentum of this disease is such that we can expect the outbreak (and case-fatality) to get worse before it gets better. Nonetheless, we remain optimistic. \n Just as with Sars, here is a chance for us to improve our community-based response with social norms of self-reliance, solidarity and cooperation. \n With concerns over rapid local spread, we must wash our hands regularly and if we feel unwell, wear a mask and avoid contact with others. We must also be judicious in the use of limited resources.   \n Inconvenience is inevitable, but we must be patient. The virus does not discriminate, and neither must we.  \n While we stay geared to fight, our spirits are uplifted by human stories of selflessness. We sense a groundswell of people motivated to strengthen our urban health security. \n Indeed, some of the panic buying ostensibly for one’s own and relatives could be arising from pent-up emotions seeking ways to respond. Perhaps we can harness this for a greater good.  \n Acts of kindness — people cooperating to give unused masks and hand sanitisers to others, and to cheer on frontline workers with food and messages of love and care — nourish our hearts with a warm glow of togetherness. \n The National Centre for Infectious Diseases and Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health have linked up with various groups to address requests on how to mount community-based responses, and clarify any misinformation on the outbreak. \n As the national crisis unfolds on two fronts — public health and public confidence — we see an excellent learning moment for all of us.  \n The community is proving vital to Team Singapore. Hence, connection and engagement with them in one whole-of-society approach should not be ignored. \n Once Singapore ceases its containment efforts and life gets back to a semblance of normality, we may yet be surprised that it happened sooner than we expected. \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Associate Professor Ooi Peng Lim is senior consultant with the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and teaches field epidemiology at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.

Air India has already evacuated more than 600 Indians from the city.\nAt present we don't know what time the flight is coming. The only thing we know is that we are going to leave Wuhan tomorrow. We are only hoping that we come back to India soon.\nAll the buildings around my home are sealed. In fact, a university hostel close to my building has been converted into an isolation ward.\nMy Chinese neighbours are helping me to get food and drinking water.\nI have not spoken face to face with anyone since January 22. There are only nine of us in our building and they all are Chinese.\nLike us, they also stay indoors all the time. The fear is so palpable that no one steps out and talks to one another. Each of us thinks the other is positive for coronavirus.\nThe Chinese government hasn't ordered people not to interact, but the atmosphere of fear lingers heavily all over.\nThe Chinese authorities have asked people not to walk in groups and try to remain solitary.\nThe person who delivers food to us messages on the WeChat app and then at a decided time he drops food at the main gate of our building. We are not allowed to go and pick up the food immediately. After the delivery boy leaves, we are allowed to leave our flat after 30 minutes and pick up our order. This is a rule that everyone has to follow in the university campus.\nThe delivery boy fears we might have coronavirus and we, on the other hand, fear that the delivery boy must be carrying coronavirus so it is a cycle of fear where everyone fears each other. We are keeping a distance from everyone.\nOn January 24, I tried to walk around our campus. I saw a man walking towards me, but suddenly he changed direction, fearing he would contract the virus.\nI don't know how far things have improved in Wuhan. Yesterday, one Chinese news article stated that water in our pipes might be contaminated with coronavirus. I have no idea whether this is true or not. And therefore we have stopped using tap water too. We used to boil tap water and drink, but now we depend on bottled water.\nI have stopped watching the news because I get more worried after watching the news. I don't feel like working too. And even if I call my family back home, how long can I talk?\nI keep fearing the worst every time I feel feverish or sneeze leading to many sleepless nights.\nIf that wasn't enough, when you go to any store to buy medicines for fever, the employees inform the doctors and you are forced to go to hospital for a check-up.\nEarlier, they would check our body temperature every two hours to find out whether I have contracted coronavirus or not; that routine changed to one day a week and now they have stopped that.\nI believe we are in the safe zone now.\nRumour mongering regarding coronavirus is very rampant.\nSome say inhaling dust particles could lead to being tested positive, forcing many to shut their windows. However, how long can one stay in an air-conditioned room?\nWe cannot even dry our clothes as we have to keep all our wet clothes inside the room because we now fear coronavirus might enter through air.\nThe Chinese government is cracking down on people who are spreading rumours and till date 15,000 people have been arrested. The government is trying its best to control rumours, but they refuse to die.\nAnother rumour was that garlic water was a cure for coronavirus. The other was that if one drank whiskey or wine you wouldn't be affected by the virus. This resulted in a rise in sale of whiskey and wine. Soon, there was no whiskey and wine was available in Wuhan.\nI had a miscarriage and returned home on January 22. On that very day, the entire city of Wuhan was shut down.\nI am thankful that I came back on January 22 or else I would have been confined to a hospital which would have been worse.\nThe worst day for me was when the doctors came to our home to check whether we were infected with coronavirus or not. There were 10 of them, all dressed up like astronauts.\nI cried and cried because I felt if I am found positive for coronavirus I would die in China and never see my country again.\nLuckily, I was not positive. And rumours spread so fast on the university campus that we were detected with coronavirus which was untrue.\nThe only way to spend our time is the WeChat group all the Indians staying in Wuhan have formed. We have become friends as we are all in the same boat.\nEvery day we feel the Air India flight will come, but it has not come yet.\nWe have run out of food and we don't have flour. We are only eating rice. There is no bread, butter or jam too.\nWe have stopped eating breakfast and eat lunch at 11 am. In fact, we have stopped enjoying meals and only want to come back to India.\nMy family is worried as they know that the isolation ward has come very close to our home; it is only 20 metres away from our home and it is just a crossing away.\nOur government is trying its best to bring us back.\nWe were told yesterday that we have to keep our belongings packed and ready as the plane could come anytime from India.\nNow we are waiting for that official phone call from the Indian embassy that will finally say that the flight has landed, and to come back home.\n"}, {"content": "Ministra confirma primeiro caso positivo de coronavírus em Portugal.

Cornoviruses form a large family of viruses and the illness they cause can range from common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).\nThese viruses are zoonotic, which means they are transmitted from animals to humans.\nWhile the exact source (i.e. the animal from which it started) of 2019-nCoV is yet to be identified, other strains of coronoviruses have previously been seen to be transmitted from civet cats to humans (in the case of SARS-CoV) and from dromedary camels to humans (in the case of MERS-CoV).\nThese aren't the only form of coronaviruses. There are many that circulate among animals but have not yet infected humans.\nThe WHO had earlier said there was no clear evidence of any human-to-human transmission of this virus, but on January 20, Chinese health officials confirmed they have identified some cases of human-to-human transmission.\nWHAT CAN 2019-nCoV DO?\nSince this is the first time 2019-nCoV is reported to have infected humans, there is limited information on the exact range of illness the virus can cause. Its effects can range from cough and fever to kidney failure and even death.\nThe WHO has listed the following common signs observed in people infected by 2019-nCoV:\nTo contain the viral infection, health officials in China have isolated the infected patients who are being treated at various medical institutions in Wuhan.\nWHERE DID THE OUTBREAK START?\nOn December 8, 2019, a patient in Wuhan city reportedly complained of pneumonia-like symptoms and sought medical help at a local hospital. Within days, many others reported similar problems, prompting health officials to launch an investigation.\nOn December 31, China informed the WHO's country office about these pneumonia cases emanating from \"unknown causes\" in Wuhan.\nTaking note of the matter and the limited information available, the WHO issued interim guidelines for all countries.\nOn January 7, Chinese authorities said they have identified 2019-nCoV as the cause of the pneumonia. However, experts are yet to identify the source of 2019-nCoV i.e. the animal from which it transmitted to humans.\nSix days later, on January 12, in a statement the WHO said national health officials in China have reported 41 confirmed cases related to this new type of pneumonia. Of these 41 patients, seven were severely ill.\nBy January 21, the number of cases rose to 217, with 198 in Wuhan alone.\nThese apart, two cases have been reported in Thailand and one each in Japan and South Korea.\nCASES OUTSIDE CHINA\nTwo confirmed cases have been reported in Thailand, besides one each in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea so far. All of these patients had recently returned from Wuhan and are being treated. The Philippines too has identified one suspected case of novel coronavirus.\nThe patient in Japan, a man, had travelled to Wuhan in late December and developed fever on January 3 when he was still in Wuhan. WHO says as per information received from Japan, the man didn't visit the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (to which most cases have been linked) or any other live animal market in Wuhan. He has also denied having close contact with any person suffering from pneumonia.\nHe returned to Japan on January 6 and tested negative for influenza. When his condition didn't improve, he visited a local hospital on January 10 and a chest x-ray revealed abnormal infiltrates. Following this, he was admitted and on January 14, the doctor attending him notified his case to a local public health authority as an unidentified serious infectious illness'.\nWhen his samples were collected and tested by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, very small amount of 2019-nCoV RNA were identified.\nIn Thailand, the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV infection was identified on January 13 (a 61-year-old woman) and the second case on January 17 (a 74-year-old woman). They had both returned from China.\nAs a precautionary measure, Thai authorities have started screening passengers at airports and thousands of passengers have been screened since January 3.\nPRECAUTIONS YOU MUST TAKE\nWuhan is a major city in China which is also a hub of international and domestic travels. Much remains to be known about how exactly the 2019-nCoV infection transmits between humans and animals, and the extent of human-to-human transmissions.\nThe WHO has issued an advisory to reduce risk among those travelling from or to the affected regions.\nMANY MORE AFFECTED THAN OFFICIAL FIGURES, CLAIMS STUDY\nAs on January 21, there were around 220 confirmed cases of infections arising from 2019-novel coronavirus.\nHowever, diseases monitoring experts in the UK have challenged this number and presented a study claiming that the actual number of patients infected can be much more than the official figures.\n\"It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported,\" the study said.\nSpeaking to BBC, Prof Neil Frugson, who was part of the study, said he was worried by the fact that three cases had been reported outside China (all comprising people who had been to Wuhan). \"For Wuhan to have exported three cases to other countries would imply there would have to be many more cases than have been reported,\" Prof Frugson told the BBC.\nTHREAT FROM YEARLY MIGRATION \nWith the ongoing festivities of the Chinese New Year, there is a heightened risk of 2019-nCoV infection spreading to other regions because in the coming weeks people (especially non-natives of Wuhan) will be travelling home for vacations.\nChina's Transport Ministry has estimated that nearly 3 billion trips will be made during the festivities which trigger the world biggest annual human migration.\nOfficials have said extra precautions will be taken this year due to the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.\n\"Transport hubs will strengthen disinfection, monitoring and prevention measures, Wang Yang,\" the Chinese Ministry of Transport's chief engineer, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. \"The emergence of the epidemic may cause panic among people, especially in areas where people are concentrated during the Spring Festival travel period,\" Wang said.\nThe WHO too has said that the annual human migration for these festivities can increase the risk of 2019-nCoV cases being reported from elsewhere.\nWith inputs from The Associated Press and Reuters.\n(This article has been updated with latest figures as on January 21.)\n"}, {"content": "wuhan virus: a timeline of how deadly virus spread. SINGAPORE — More than 2,000 people across the globe have been infected by a coronavirus — now called 2019-nCoV — which began in China last year. \n The outbreak of the virus was first reported in Wuhan in China’s Hubei province and it is believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live animals. \n As of Sunday (Jan 26), there were four confirmed cases of the coronavirus here in Singapore. The latest case is a 36-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who arrived in the Republic with his family on Wednesday. \n Here is a timeline of how the deadly virus has spread. \n Dec 31, 2019: China alerted the World Health Organisation (WHO) to several cases of pneumonia in the port city of Wuhan in Hubei province. \n Jan 1, 2020: The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where several of those who were ill worked at, was shut down. \n Jan 3, 2020: Temperature screening was implemented at Singapore’s Changi Airport for inbound travellers arriving on flights from Wuhan. \n Jan 7, 2020: The WHO gave the virus a name: 2019-nCoV.

Beijing also cancelled events for Chinese New Year starting Jan 25, while officials reported the first death outside of Hubei. \n Jan 23, 2020: Singapore confirmed its first imported case of the coronavirus. The patient, a 66-year-old male Chinese national, had arrived in the country on Jan 20. \n Jan 24, 2020: Two more cases of the Wuhan virus were confirmed in Singapore by the MOH. One is the son of the first confirmed case in Singapore, the other a female Wuhan resident.. \n Jan 25, 2020: Travel restrictions were imposed on a further five cities in Hubei province in China, taking the overall number of people affected to 56 million. \n Jan 25, 2020: Malaysia's health minister Dzulkefly Ahmad confirmed three people have contracted coronavirus in the country.

The latest case is a 36-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with his family on Wednesday. The man, who had not displayed any symptoms of the Wuhan virus during his flight to Singapore, had stayed at Village Hotel Sentosa after his arrival. \n Jan 26, 2020: More than 2,000 people globally have been infected with the new coronavirus, the vast majority of them in China, where 56 people have died from the disease. \n Jan 26, 2020: Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park closed on Sunday “out of consideration for the health and safety of our guests and cast members”. Shanghai Disneyland, which expected 100,000 visitors daily through the Chinese New Year holidays, has already closed. Many cinemas across China are also closed with major film premieres postponed, slashing revenues. WITH AGENCIES \n "}, {"content": "global supplier india curbs drug exports as coronavirus fears grow. BENGALURU/NEW DELHI - India, the world's main supplier of generic drugs, has restricted the export of 26 pharmaceutical ingredients and the medicines made from them, including Paracetamol, a common pain reliever also sold as acetaminophen, as the coronavirus outbreak plays havoc with supply chains.  \n The Indian government urged calm and said there were enough stocks to manufacture formulations for two-to-three months.  \n The government's list of 26 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and medicines accounts for 10% of all Indian pharmaceutical exports and includes several antibiotics, such as tinidazole and erythromycin, the hormone progesterone and Vitamin B12.  \n It was unclear how the restriction would impact the availability of these medicines in the countries that import from India and also depend on China. In the United States, for instance, Indian imports accounted for 24 percent of medicines and 31 percent of medicine ingredients in 2018, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  \n FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told U.S. senators on Tuesday that the agency is working to determine how the restrictions will affect the U.S. medical supply and the effect on essential medicines.  \n The FDA last week announced the first coronavirus-related drug shortage in the United States but declined to name the drug in question. Hahn said on Tuesday that drug was in shortage because of a lack of materials needed to make the API.  \n Indian drugmakers rely on China, the source of the virus outbreak, for almost 70% of the APIs for their medicines. Industry experts say they are likely to face shortages if the epidemic drags on.  \n \"Export of specified APIs and formulations made from these APIs... is hereby 'restricted' with immediate effect and till further orders,\" the Director General of Foreign Trade said in a statement https://dgft.gov.in/sites/default/files/Noti%2050_0.pdf on Tuesday, without explaining the extent of the restrictions.  \n \"Irrespective of the ban, some of these molecules may face shortages for the next couple of months,\" Dinesh Dua, chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India, told Reuters. The council falls under the federal commerce ministry.  \n \"If coronavirus is not contained, then in that case there could be acute shortages,\" Dua said.  \n In a statement, the Indian federal government said state authorities had been asked to monitor the production and availability of APIs and formulations to prevent black marketing and hoarding.  \n U.S. drugmakers have said they are monitoring their supply chains and Mylan NV <MYL.O> warned last week that there could be drug shortages. Eli Lilly and Co <LLY.N> said on Tuesday it does not expect the coronavirus outbreak to result in shortages for any of its therapies, including insulin products.  \n  \n INDIA MONITORING PATIENTS  \n Separately, the Indian government said on Tuesday it had detected \"high viral load\" in six people who had been in contact with a patient who contracted the virus in New Delhi, the capital.  \n The patient in New Delhi was being monitored and was stable, the government said.  \n The six people have been kept in isolation and their samples are being sent to India's National Institute of Virology for confirmation, the government said in a statement https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1604938.  \n Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to quell public fears.  \n \"There is no need to panic,\" he said in a tweet.  \n \"Had an extensive review regarding preparedness on the COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus.

Novel coronavirus has tested the might of the world powers. The world is feeling the heat of the pandemic on multiple fronts. It is scampering to rescue humankind from grip of Covid-19 and facing an uphill task of preventing an economic collapse.\nWhile concrete data of loss in businesses and of employment come months later, the sentiment in the markets across the world is gloomy. This is reflected in the frequent crashes in the share markets in all parts of the world.\nThis is the biggest economic crisis in the world since 2008. Some people are already calling it the biggest since 1929-30 economic recession. Unemployment has risen in all affected countries. In the US, data point to biggest jump in people enrolling for unemployment benefits. In India, the worries are similar but there are no concrete data yet to support.\nThe only data reflection is share market. The Sensex is racing to go back to the pre-Modi government level in India. On Monday, the Sensex closed below 26,000-mark. It recorded the biggest-ever single-day fall of 3,934 points closing at 25,981. The Sensex had crossed the 25,000-mark barrier for the first time on the day the Modi government was voted to power in 2014 - on the day of counting.\nIn the past one month, the Sensex has broken record of biggest single-day fall five times. The current season of coronavirus-induced volatility in the share market has wiped off Rs 52 lakh crore of the investors. This is a picture in contrast from the high point on January 13 this year when the Sensex was racing towards 42,000-mark having crossed 41,952.\nThe template is same for all the major economies. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission has enforced four circuit breakers in the Month of March. It is a safeguard that pauses trading for 15 minutes hoping the market will calm.\nCircuit breaker is a tool created in the US after 1987 market crash in which the Dow plunged nearly 23 per cent. Before being enforced four times this month, it had been used only once - during 1997 crash.\nSimilar panic has been seen in the UK, Germany, France and all Asian markets except China, the source country for novel coronavirus pandemic.\nChina's share market benchmark, Shanghai Composite Index (SCE) was at 2,915 on December 12. It was just before the news of novel coronavirus outbreak in China started surfacing. It reached the high point of 3,115 on January 13 and slipped marginally to 3,095 on January 20 when China for the first time officially admitted novel coronavirus outbreak with pressure building from within and outside the country.\nOn January 23, when it closed for Chinese new year holidays, it was trading at 2,976. It saw a major fall on February 3 when it opened after holidays were extended in the wake of novel coronavirus outbreak. Trading was closed before time at 2,746 point.\nInterestingly, China a day earlier had announced infusing liquidity worth of $173 billion into its markets. This kept the sentiments in Chinese markets in good spirit despite increasing cases of novel coronavirus in China through February. The result was the losses in Chinese stock markets were not as severe as outside.\nThe Shanghai Composite on Tuesday stood at 2,722 - not much below the pre-Covid-19 phase. The world has lost hundreds of billions during this phase.\nWhile Indian rupee has been fragile under the impact of novel coronavirus, Chinese yuan or renminbi has remained relatively strong against the US dollar. In the official basket of currencies, yuan has, in fact, climbed more than 4.75 per cent this year, which has been under the shadow of coronavirus pandemic.\nAccording to China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the average daily difference in the US and Chinese 10-year government bond yield is 172 basis points. This means the Chinese assets offers far more attractive returns for an investor.\nSimply put, China seems to be the financially least affected of all countries rocked by novel coronavirus pandemic despite weeks of lockdown. Share market data may not be the ultimate measure of economic impact of Covid-19. However, China is not known to put out adverse data in public. So, true scale of damage may not be known for years.\nThere is another explanation, however, for less volatility seen in China's share markets. Of the tradable share market capitalization in China, foreign capital accounts for less than four per cent. The rest is in the hands of the Chinese government, directly or indirectly.\nThe curve of Chinese stock exchange indices is also curious in the sense that China's was one of the worst-performing share markets before Covid-19 changed the world market outlook.\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 2-Marriott, Booking Holdings warn of virus hit as JetBlue waives cancellation fees.

Analysts were expecting $6.47 per share, according to Refinitiv data.\n"}, {"content": "From elections to coronavirus: Factors which have affected IPL in its 13-year-old history. With the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) suspending the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 till 15th April 2020, as a precautionary measure against the ongoing novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the decision marks only the 3rd time when the popular tournament has been effected due to external events.\nIPL 2020 was originally slated to start from March 29 and continue till May 24 but the fate of the tournament now lies in the dark as the coronavirus pandemic continues to rise within the country.\nThe deadly virus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year has claimed over 4,900 lives and infected more than 124,330 people worldwide. India on Thursday reported its first novel Covid-19 fatality after a 76-year-old man who died two days ago was tested positive. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country soared to 75 on Friday.\nAs we continue to track the developments surrounding the IPL 2020 and the coronavirus outbreak, here is a look at the past instances when the tournament has had to undergo changes in the schedule/venue owing to factors not in the BCCI's control:\n2009\nThe 2nd edition of IPL was entirely played in South Africa because of the Lok Sabha general elections which were also going to clash with the marquee event. With 2 mega events planned in the same window, the unavailability of security forces in the country forced the BCCI to shift the entire tournament out of India and in to South Africa. Still, the tournament proved to be a huge success after you discount the bizarre seven-and-a-half-minute television timeout which was introduced in the IPL for the first time. The now-defunct franchise Deccan Chargers won their maiden IPL title under the leadership of Adam Gilchrist beating Royal Challengers Bangalore by 6 runs in a pulsating final.\n2014\nThe general elections once again proved to be the IPL's bane as a part of the tournament was held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Held from April 16, 2014 to June 1, 2014, the 1st 20 matches of the 7th season of the IPL were held different stadiums in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah with the tournament returning to India on May 2.\nAs it was 5 years ago, this time too, the main reason for the venue shift was the clash with the general elections in the country. In the final played in Bangalore, Kolkata Knight Riders won the trophy by chasing down Kings XI Punjab's target of 200 with relative ease. India Test wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha, who scored a thrilling 115* off 55 balls in the title-clash, also became the 1st player to score a century in an IPL final.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavírus: exportações chinesas caem 15,9% nos dois primeiros meses do ano.

Mas há outros cientistas, na China e na Europa, que calculam que o pico da epidemia só acontecerá no final deste mês de Fevereiro (ou seja, durante esta semana). Outros investigadores acreditam que o novo coronavírus ainda vai infectar milhões de pessoas durante os próximos tempos. Os casos aumentam todos os dias, mostrando que o vírus continua a somar vítimas no local de origem do surto (na China) e fora da Ásia. Apesar de ainda não ser possível identificar com precisão o pico da epidemia, é seguro dizer que os casos ainda não mostraram sinais de um evidente abrandamento.

No entanto, é impossível dizer se esta é a definitiva taxa de mortalidade associada a este vírus. Com a evolução da situação, os dados podem mudar. Uma análise detalhada da informação sobre todos os casos confirmados até ao momento, no site da Worldometer, revela por exemplo que a taxa de mortalidade em Wuhan (onde o novo coronavírus foi identificado em Dezembro) é de 4,9%. Na análise das mais de 2500 mortes registadas até ao momento em todo o mundo e que correspondem a uma taxa de mortalidade de 2,1%, há mais homens (dois terços dos casos), mais de 80% das vítimas tinham mais de 60 anos e 75% tinham outras doenças associadas.\nQuantas pessoas infectadas recuperaram?\nA grande maioria das vítimas recuperou.

On January 31, as a special Air India flight evacuated 324 Indians from Wuhan, Monika Sethuraman, 31, broke down in tears realising that she wouldn't be on the plane. \"I couldn't breathe for a few seconds...I am stuck here in the city, and it's now turned into a huge prison,\" she says over the phone from her one-room dormitory. The doctoral scholar in international relations at Wuhan's Central China Normal University had been instrumental in contacting the Indian embassy and arranging the evacuation of fellow Indians following an outbreak of the new novel corona­virus (2019-nCoV).\nFor Sethuraman herself, leaving Wuhan won't be easy now. \"I didn't go to the airport because I knew I would not be cleared for the flight out. Even if I recover from the cold, once you are on the blacklist, you will not be allowed to fly out,\" she laments. Since the transport lockdown on January 23, Sethuraman has stocked up on essentials. According to her, stepping out is futile. One will be spotted by a drone, the building security cameras or police, and sent back indoors. \"The authorities aren't interested in testing or verifying if you have the virus. They are only interested in control...it doesn't matter if we live or die so as long as the virus is contained,\" she says. \"I am foll­owing WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines, but there is no human interface to connect to. If people see you wiping your nose, they run from you, including the officials. That's the kind of panic and desperation here.\"\nThe travails of Vinay Ahuja, 38, who was visiting business associates in the region when the city went into a lockdown, are no different. \"Nobody expected it to escalate so quickly,\" he says, as he marks time before he gets permission to fly out. What Ahuja and many others are wondering is whether India would be able to replicate China's iron-fisted attempts to control the outbreak in a similar situation. China has been criticised by human rights groups, but received praise from WHO for its aggressive approach to control 2019-nCoV. The country built a 645,000 sq. ft emergency hospital in Wuhan in just 10 days. The two-storeyed hospital has 30 intensive care units (ICUs), 1,000 beds and special corridors to limit patient-nurse contact. A second hospital could be up by February 5.\nSeldom has an illness-largely a little-known respiratory disease-aroused such apprehensions as the 'corona', now part of the popular lexicon as a dreaded threat, eclipsing the pleasant connotations of being the aura around the Sun and a branded cold brew. First detected in December 2019, 2019-nCoV is a previously unidentified strain. It comes from the same family of viruses as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), which claimed 774 lives, including three Indians in 2002-03.\nThe situation in India is nowhere as grim as at epicentre Wuhan, though three cases had been confirmed until February 5, while 3,935 were under observation at isolation wards across the country, apart from the special camps for Wuhan returnees near Delhi airport. So, how prepared is India to handle the coronavirus in case the numbers spike?\nConsidering there is no vaccine or trial-proven drug therapy yet, aff­ected patients are being treated symptomatically based on clinical severity. \"Serious cases who have viral pneumonia will need supportive intensive care, including mechanical ventilation when required. Hospitals in large cities can provide this, if the numbers are not overwhelming. Small towns and rural areas in most states will be ill-equipped if the virus spreads further,\" says Dr K. Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI).\nThe public health system will have to go the extra mile to check the potential spread of the virus. Entry points to the country are being closely monitored to assess incoming travellers. There is still the danger of infected persons slipping through in the asymptomatic but infectious phase of the illness. Isolation of clinically-suspected cases is essential even where a specific virological diagnosis is not immediately available. Close contacts of affected persons are being advised clinical assessment and restricted mobility till the incubation period (up to two weeks) is over. \"Since the symptoms are not specific to this virus, a high index of suspicion is needed based on history of exposure to a proven/ likely case, even where laboratory facilities for a specific viral diagnosis are not readily available,\" explains Reddy. \"We have to educate the public with well-framed risk communication messaging and health advice, and all healthcare providers must follow the correct diagnostic/ clinical protocols.\"\nA comprehensive nationwide surveillance system is still a work in progress. While this network has expanded since the H1N1 virus threat loomed large a decade ago, competent labs are needed at more locations. In 2012, there was a proposal to set up 150 diagnostic and research labs with virology-related expertise. Of these, 80 are operable now, but this number is far from adequate. These are also not linked to the public health response system and only serve as support for ad hoc reporting.\nThough India has an integrated dis­ease surveillance programme in each district, this is done at a micro level and largely follows a symptomatic approach. \"We need case-based surveillance-where any suspicious disease outbreaks are reported to labs for real-time con­f­irmation. What we have is reporting at district levels based on extreme symptoms,\" says Dr G. Arun Kumar, head, Manipal Institute of Virology, one of four diagnostic labs under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).\nDetailed investigations found that the SARS-CoV was transmitted from palm civets to humans in China in 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) from dromedary camels to humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The animal source of the 2019-nCoV is yet to be identified. It's likely the source is a live animal market in China.\nLabs and the health system have also largely overlooked animal research and the risk mapping of India. There are several types of animal to human transmitted (zoonotic) diseases. They vary in terms of pathogen diversity (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths) and animal sources (bats, pigs, chickens, other birds, palm civets, dogs, fishes, crustaceans and snakes). India has fairly well-established programmes for monitoring zoonotic diseases like rabies, brucellosis and Japanese encephalitis. It is the threat of newer viruses, transmitted from wild or cap­tive bred animals, that is most worrisome.\n\"To identify the emergence and spread patterns of zoonotic pathogens, we need a 'one-health' approach, combining research data from wildlife, veterinary and human populations involving biology, epidemiology and clinical studies. Surveillance of wet markets, involving sale of animal foods, has to be strengthened. At the same time, research needs to identify entry points of zoonotic pathogens from outbreaks in other countries,\" explains Dr Reddy.\nAgencies such as the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the ICMR have advanced efforts in these areas. Yet, India is unequal to the task, be it handling an emergency or pursuing priority research. The weak links lie in inadequately integ­rated epidemiological surveillance of zoonotic pathogens in forests, close-bred veterinary clusters and human population groups. This is one of the reasons why Nipah claimed 17 lives in Kerala in 2018. The dearth of virologic and taxonomic studies on native bats made it difficult to understand the nature of the virus. However, the state has learnt from the tragedy. Kerala has declared 2019-nCoV a state calamity and has kept over 2,000 people under surveillance at their homes. \"This is to tighten vigil rather than create panic. We do not want to miss out on any case,\" says state health minister K.K. Shailaja.\nThis level of vigilance has not been replicated elsewhere. Despite India being in the top 30 countries at risk from the virus, there has been no statement from the minister of health and no central guidelines for detecting and controlling infection. In contrast, European countries began tracking down visitors from China and putting out strong public advisories two weeks after the outbreak. Precautionary guidelines for the public in India are yet to be widely disseminated, in English or in local languages.\n\"There are all kinds of misleading reports giving the public incorrect information to help cure the virus. Most people also do not know how to protect themselves, which masks to wear, and so on. Public education has been entirely neglected so far,\" says Chapal Mehra, a public health specialist in Delhi. \"We need a proactive approach, not a reactionary one. Large-scale screening of risk individuals has to be a priority. It's a challenge for our public health system, which is yet to come out with a strategic approach to the issue,\" he adds.\nA concerted multi-agency response, led by a competent public health system, is the need of the hour, but it is currently hampered by the limited expertise in the country. In the medium term, agile outbreak response systems have to be built, primary healthcare facilities (where clinical assessments take place) strengthened and vaccine development efforts advanced.\nIf the virus does spread here in the same magnitude as in Wuhan, the impact on the economy, healthcare and public morale could be catastrophic. With one of the world's highest population densities, especially in urban cities like Delhi and Mumbai, maintaining three-feet distance between individuals (as recommended by the WHO) will be impossible, nor will the lockdown of an entire city be feasible. Meanwhile, social media broadcasts by individuals in Wuhan paint a grim picture. Shortage of food and medicines, panic and misinformation, depression, even theft-the virus doesn't just destroy health, it destroys society. It's already visible in Kerala. There are media reports of families of China returnees being 'ostracised'.\n"}, {"content": "Global airlines start suspending flights to China amidst deadly coronavirus outbreak.

To the extent that these countries take effective containment measures... then at some point in time, I think border controls to these countries will no longer be so relevant,” he said, referring to China and South Korea. \n Mr Wong said China has been working hard to contain the virus and the number of new cases have gone down, while South Korea is taking proactive testing measures and is also vigilant in containing the spread to other cities. \n When deciding on whether to lift travel restrictions on these visitors, Singapore will consider “if the situation within these countries is clearly very well contained” and look at other data and evidence. \n The second part is whether to impose new border control measures, such as travel restrictions, targeting new epidemic centres of Covid-19, he said. \n “I will not rule it out at this stage, but if you think and project ahead, and indeed if the virus is spreading and not that we have one clear epidemic centre and there are epidemics all around the world and it becomes a global pandemic, then there is no basis for putting together border controls unless we shut ourselves, which we don’t want to,” he said. \n Whether Singapore decides to impose these new bans depends on the evolving situation and the usefulness of such restrictions, added Mr Wong. \n “At that stage, the bigger risk is not importation of cases from these countries, but the importation of cases from countries that may not have travel restrictions… We are now seeing more cases coming from Europe, we are starting to see more cases in America, so it is starting to look like a global pandemic everywhere in the world,” he said. \n Addressing a question on whether lifting these measures at a time when Singapore deems fit to do so would inadvertently cause a surge of visitors from places previously seen as high-risk, Mr Gan said it was important not to see Singapore’s approach to border controls in a “binary way”, since its actions have been incremental. \n This is evident in how Singapore has gradually ramped up its restrictions from Wuhan - where Covid-19 was first reported - to Hubei province and then to the rest of mainland China, he said. \n Mr Gan also noted how at the checkpoints, Singapore first rolled out temperature screening measures, and later increasing these measures to also conduct swab tests at the borders. \n “Even for countries that we have border controls, we may adjust incrementally so it doesn’t mean that if we open the floodgates (by lowering travel restrictions), everybody will come in overnight,” said Mr Gan. \n He urged Singaporeans to keep up on personal hygiene efforts, emphasising the critical importance of the new SG Clean campaign launched earlier last month. \n A new taskforce, headed by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, was announced Friday (March 6) to encourage good personal hygiene, adjust social norms and raise cleaning standards across the country. \n Mr Gan said besides measures such as border controls, the SG Clean campaign is in fact Singapore’s first line of defence. \n He said: “Whether we have temperature screening or swab tests, it is not a hundred per cent. Even if we have restrictions on travel (from certain countries), we will also have Singaporeans coming back and we can’t stop them from returning to Singapore. \n “Therefore, personal hygiene and public health standards are the most important (moves) and that is why we need to push ahead with SG Clean,” he said. \n GLOBAL PANDEMIC AN ‘EMOTIVE’ TERM \n The World Health Organization (WHO), although avoiding any reference to Covid-19 as a pandemic so far, has nevertheless called upon the world to be prepared for one. \n It currently refers to Covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. A pandemic, according to WHO definitions, refers to “the worldwide spread of a new disease”. \n In a separate interview following the press conference, MOH’s Associate Professor Mak was asked if Singapore would be making representations to the WHO on calling Covid-19 a pandemic. \n Dr Mak said the use of the term carries highly emotive overtones, as well as the notion that countries or continents have failed to control the spread of infections within their borders. \n “As the WHO has said, there is significant potential for a pandemic to arise, but we may not have reached a stage where individual countries and their local efforts to contain it have failed,” said Dr Mak. He added that it is perhaps more helpful to look at how individual countries are stepping up efforts to control the spread of the virus, and how viruses transmits from one country to another. \n On its part, Singapore is collaborating and sharing best practices to tackle Covid-19 with other countries, he said. There is also the possibility to coordinate national strategies across borders on how to respond to the virus — the health ministries of Malaysia and Singapore have formed a joint working committee to fight Covid-19, for example. \n “These are areas that we continue to look at seriously and we continue to be in discussion with international health authorities, our sister (agencies) in the region and further out, to see how we can share information and align our measures,” he said. \n "}, {"content": "WRAPUP 2-Airlines at centre of storm as coronavirus spreads.

IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days.\nLower air traffic growth projections prompted Spanish travel technology firm Amadeus (AMA.MC) to forecast slower 2020 core profit growth on Friday, but it stressed the outlook did not yet account for the uncertain impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\nTo deal with the drop in business, IAG said it was cutting costs, without giving details - joining the likes of Germany’s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Amsterdam-based KLM (AIRF.PA) which have announced similar plans.\nIt also said flight cancellations would reduce capacity growth this year, although CEO Willie Walsh said the group could start to add capacity if other airlines failed.\nAirline stocks have been among the biggest casualties of a stock market rout this week as coronavirus fears have gripped investors. At 0845 GMT, IAG shares were down 8% at 474.59 pence, while easyJet (EZJ.L) stock was down 3% at 1,075 pence and Finnair (FIA1S.HE) was off 3.4% at 4.922 euros.\n(Graphic: Europe's Airlines - here)\nBudget carrier EasyJet reported a “significant” softening of demand into and out of its bases in northern Italy - the center of the biggest coronavirus outbreak in Europe - and a reduction across its other European markets.\nIt also said it would be cancelling some flights, particularly into and out of Italy, and that it would make cost savings across its business, without giving details.\n“We continue to monitor the situation carefully and will update the market in due course,” it said, adding it was too early to determine the impact on its results.\nFinnair, meanwhile, warned of a “significant” fall in operating profit this year due to virus-related disruption.\nFinland’s national airline also said its was scrapping its 2020 capacity growth target, and would look into cutting costs by 40-50 million euros ($44-54 million), with measures under consideration including temporary layoffs.\n"}, {"content": "CORRECTED-Chinese public dial in for support as coronavirus takes mental toll. SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Hundreds of 24-hour mental health support telephone hotlines have sprung up in China in recent weeks as millions of people fret about catching the coronavirus - and try to avoid infection by staying at home.\nMedical professionals welcomed the launch of several official services in a country where mental health remains a relatively taboo subject, but cautioned that unofficial talk lines could do more harm than good.\n“There are a lot of hotlines out there staffed by a lot of volunteers but it just doesn’t make sense because there’s not many that can be well-trained,” said Cui Erjing, a Seattle-based volunteer for one of the hotlines, who is originally from China’s Southern Guangdong province.\n“It can be really traumatising to ask for support but not get the right responses.”\nA survey by the Chinese Psychology Society published by state media last week found that of 18,000 people tested for anxiety related to the coronavirus outbreak, 42.6% registered a positive response. Of 5,000 people evaluated for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 21.5% had obvious symptoms.\nThe hashtag #howtodealwithfeelingveryanxiousathome has been trending on social media platform Weibo, with more than 170 million views, as misinformation about the spread of the disease and travel bans feed public worries.\nThe hotlines are part of the government’s “first level response” for dealing with the psychological impact of major health emergencies, a strategy that was first deployed following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, a disaster in which 87,150 people were killed or listed as missing.\nThe National Health Commission said more than 300 hotlines had launched across the country to provide mental health advice related to coronavirus, with support from university psychology departments, counseling services and NGOs.\nThey have been inundated by callers in a country which has just 2.2 psychiatrists available for every 100,000 people, according to WHO data, five times fewer than in the United States.\nA national hotline run by Beijing Normal University was overwhelmed when it went live at the end of January, said Cheng Qi, a Shanghai-based psychologist.\nWhile the number of calls has dropped as other lines opens, the content has become more challenging, Cheng said, noting one caller with chronic depression who had reported suicidal thoughts triggered by the barrage of bad news.\n“It’s not the virus [that caused it], but the virus is stimulating it,” she said.\nXu Wang, a psychotherapist at Tsinghua University, which is working with the official Beijing city hotline, said a major challenge was working out which callers showed real symptoms of the virus and which were instead suffering from anxiety.\n“Callers often have somatic issues, and might say, ‘I can’t eat well, can’t sleep well, and I want to know if it’s a virus infection,’” he said.\nA volunteer group of more than 400 therapists called ‘Yong Xin Kang Yi’, which roughly translates to ‘Use Heart to Fight the Virus’, focuses on helping overworked medical staff in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.\n“They leave messages saying they’re exhausted, that they’re scared,” Cui said. “The doctors don’t know if they’re going to get infected or if their co-workers or going to get infected, and they don’t know how bad it’s spreading.”\nMedical researchers from Peking University included telephone and internet counseling for healthcare staff, patients, and the public among six key strategies for coping with mental stress over the coronavirus outbreak.\n“We believe that including mental health care in the national public health emergency system will empower China and the world during the campaign to contain and eradicate\n2019-nCoV,” the researchers said in a paper published in The Lancet medical journal last week.\nThe government recently issued guidance for the hotlines, saying they should be free, confidential, staffed by volunteers with relevant professional backgrounds and supervised by experienced by experts.\nStill, concerns remain about enforcement.\n“There are many individually initiated helplines and it’s difficult to gain consistent support and supervision,” said Sami Wong, a Beijing-based psychotherapist.\nTsinghua University’s Xu said the very nature of the hotlines added to the challenges, preventing volunteers from gaining much-needed face-to-face experience with people suffering mental health issues.\nWong worried that untrained volunteers could easily put their foot in their mouth. A seemingly innocuous “I can understand how you feel” can cause vulnerable people to clam up, she said: “PTSD training is not something you can learn overnight.”\n(This story corrects transliteration of names in paragraphs 3, 15 and 16)\n"}, {"content": "Primeiro caso de coronavírus confirmado na Bélgica.

This potential for further global spread is why I called the EC,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was in China on Wednesday to assess the level of coronavirus outbreak in the nation, said that the country has been doing a good job in controlling the disease.\nHe also said that the World Health Organisation was working round the clock with networks of scientists, clinicians, disease trackers, governments and others to coordinate the new coronavirus response.\nThe WHO chief said that the people who have contracted new coronavirus are showing a wide range of symptoms. Of known cases, most people exhibit milder symptoms, but about one in five people have a severe illness, including pneumonia and respiratory failure.\n\"People can take a range of measures to protect their health, including hand-washing and properly covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing,\" he said.\n"}, {"content": "Wuhan-Rückkehrer in pfälzischer Kaserne unter Quarantäne gestellt. Die Bundeswehr hat mehr als 100 Deutsche nach ihrer Rückkehr aus der chinesischen Stadt Wuhan in einer Kaserne im südpfälzischen Germersheim unter Quarantäne gestellt. Sie waren am Samstagabend mit einer Bundeswehrmaschine in Frankfurt am Main gelandet und mit mehreren Bussen zu dem Ausbildungsstandort der Luftwaffe gebracht worden, der nun als Quarantänestation dient. Dort sollen die Rückkehrer mindestens zwei Wochen unter ärztlicher Beaufsichtigung bleiben. So will man sicherstellen, dass sich das vor rund einem Monat in China ausgebrochene Coronavirus nicht weiterverbreitet. Neben den Deutschen waren auch 22 Chinesen, ein Amerikaner und ein Rumäne an Bord der Maschine.\nElf der insgesamt 124 Passagiere waren nach einer Untersuchung am Flughafen in die Frankfurter Universitätsklinik gebracht worden – unter ihnen eine Patientin, bei der Ärzte eine Coronavirus-Erkrankung nicht ausschließen können. Bei den übrigen zehn lägen andere medizinische Gründe vor, sagte Hessens Sozialminister Kai Klose. Die Behörden betonten, die Gefahr für die Bevölkerung sei gering.\nEnde 2019 meldeten die chinesischen Behörden der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO eine Häufung von Lungenentzündungen unklarer Ursache in der zentralchinesischen Stadt Wuhan. Bereits eine Woche später identifizierten chinesische Forscher ein neuartiges Virus als Ursache der Krankheitsfälle. Es gehört zur Gruppe der Coronaviren. Wenige Tage darauf veröffentlichte eine Gruppe um den Virologen Christian Drosten von der Berliner Charité den ersten diagnostischen Test für das neue Virus, das Forscher provisorisch 2019-nCoV nennen. Mit dem Test kann das Virus im Labor nachgewiesen werden. Als Quelle des Erregers vermuten die chinesischen Behörden einen Lebensmittelmarkt in Wuhan, auf dem neben Fisch und Meeresfrüchten auch exotische Tiere wie Schlangen verkauft wurden. Der Markt wurde geschlossen und desinfiziert.\nSowohl die Atemwegserkrankungen Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) als auch Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) werden von Coronaviren verursacht, die ihren Ursprung in Tieren haben. Während der Sars-Pandemie infizierten sich in den Jahren 2002 und 2003 etwa 8.000 Menschen, mehr als 750 starben. Mit dem Mers-Virus haben sich seit seiner Entdeckung 2012 bis zum Jahresende 2019 etwa 2.500 Menschen angesteckt, jeder Dritte ist daran gestorben. Insgesamt gibt es aber mehrere Hundert Arten von Coronaviren. Viele von ihnen betreffen die Atemwege und können zum Beispiel Erkältungen verursachen.\nIn China sind inzwischen mehrere Tausend Personen erkrankt, einige von ihnen – die meisten wohl mit Vorerkrankungen – sind an einer Lungenentzündung infolge des Virus gestorben. Die ersten Infektionsfälle außerhalb Chinas wurden in Thailand, Japan und Südkorea bekannt. Es handelt sich um Reisende, die vorher in Wuhan gewesen waren. Am 21. Januar meldeten US-Behörden die erste Infektion bei einem Touristen, der aus Wuhan zurückkam, am 24. Januar wurden die ersten Fälle in Frankreich bekannt. Mittlerweile wurden auch erste Fälle in Deutschland bestätigt. Typische Zeichen einer Infektion sind Fieber, Husten und Atembeschwerden. Das Virus kann eine Lungenentzündung verursachen, die tödlich enden kann. Da es sich um eine virale Krankheit handelt, helfen Antibiotika nicht.\nInzwischen ist klar, dass das Virus von Mensch zu Mensch übertragen werden kann. Chinesische Behörden haben mehrere solcher Übertragungen bestätigt, nachdem auch etwa ein Dutzend Fälle bei medizinischem Personal bekannt wurden. Medizinerinnen und Mediziner gehen davon aus, dass das Virus vor allem über Tröpfcheninfektion übertragen wird. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation rechnet, wie sie am 24. Januar mitteilte, momentan damit, dass ein Infizierter im Schnitt 1,4 bis 2,5 andere Menschen ansteckt. Bewahrheiten sich diese Zahlen, ist das Virus weniger ansteckend als Sars und auch die Virusgrippe. Die WHO empfiehlt generelle Hygieneregeln zu beachten: Man solle sich häufig die Hände waschen und engen Kontakt zu Personen mit Atemwegserkrankungen und wilden Tieren meiden.\nDas lässt sich noch nicht mit Sicherheit sagen. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation teilte am 28. Januar mit, dass ungefähr ein Fünftel der gemeldeten Fälle durch das Virus schwer krank werde, im Zweifelsfall also intensivmedizinisch behandelt werden muss. Berichten zufolge handelte es sich bei den ersten Todesopfern um Patienten, die teils schwere Vorerkrankungen hatten. Auch bei anderen Infektionskrankheiten sind Menschen mit Vorerkrankungen besonders gefährdet – etwa bei der Grippe. Coronaviren sind dafür bekannt, dass sie mutieren, also ihr Erbgut verändern können. Das kann dazu führen, dass sie im Laufe eines Ausbruchs gefährlicher für Menschen werden – aber auch zum genauen Gegenteil. Das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) erwartet zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt keine ähnlich hohe Mortalität wie beim Ausbruch von Sars.\nBislang haben sich neun Deutsche mit dem neuartigen Virus infiziert. In Bayern meldete das Gesundheitsministerium am Samstag einen achten Krankheitsfall, während Spanien bekannt gab, ein deutscher Tourist habe sich mit dem Coronavirus infiziert. Das Coronavirus hat eine Inkubationszeit von\nbis zu zwei Wochen, in\nder noch keine Symptome auftreten. Trotzdem kann eine Infektion vorliegen.\nDer Rückflug der Deutschen aus Wuhan löste diplomatische Spannungen mit Russland aus. Die Bundeswehrmaschine hatte ursprünglich in Moskau zwischenlanden sollen. Dafür hatten russische Luftfahrtbehörden auch eine Landegenehmigung in Aussicht gestellt. Am Ende aber habe Russland die Zwischenlandung verweigert und dies damit begründet, dass der Flughafen Moskau Kapazitätsengpässe habe, sagte Verteidigungsministerin Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (CDU). Die Ministerin kündigte ein mögliches Nachspiel an.\nIn Russland waren am Freitag die\nersten Coronavirus-Fälle aufgetreten. Wie viele andere Länder hat\nRussland deshalb die Einreisestimmungen für Chinesen verschärft. Für Reisegruppen aus China, die seit dem Jahr 2000 ohne Visum ins Land reisen konnten, gelte ab sofort die Visumspflicht, teilte\ndie Regierung in Moskau mit. Zudem werde China vorerst keine Arbeitsvisa mehr für Chinesen\nausstellen. Die Maßnahmen dienten der \"Sicherheit des Landes und dem Schutz der öffentlichen Gesundheit\". Zudem solle dadurch die Ausbreitung des neuen Coronavirus verhindert werden. Es handele sich um \"vorübergehende\" Einschränkungen, betonte die Regierung. Die Volksrepublik ist der\nwichtigste Handelspartner Russlands.\nIn China breitet sich die Epidemie weiter aus. Das Land erlebte am Samstag den bisher höchsten Anstieg der Infektionen und Todesfälle innerhalb eines Tages. Die Gesundheitskommission in Peking meldete einen Anstieg von fast 2.000 neuen Erkrankten und 45 Toten. Damit sind nach Angaben der Behörde insgesamt 304 Menschen in der Volksrepublik an der Atemwegserkrankung gestorben. Mehr als 13.700 Menschen haben sich in ganz China infiziert. Die 45 neuen Toten stammen aus der besonders stark betroffenen Provinz Hubei.\nVon Wuhan hat sich das Virus in 24 weitere Länder ausgebreitet. Wie die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) am Sonntag mitteilte, starb in der philippinischen Hauptstadt Manila erstmals ein Infizierter außerhalb Chinas. Es handele sich um einen Chinesen aus Wuhan.\nAngesichts der Notsituation hat die Europäische Union zwölf Tonnen Schutzkleidung nach China geschickt. Wie die EU-Kommission mitteilte, hatte die Volksrepublik um die Hilfsmittel gebeten. Das EU-Notfall-Koordinierungszentrum habe Kontakt mit den EU-Staaten aufgenommen. Diese hätten die zwölf Tonnen Schutzkleidung zusammengetragen.\n"}, {"content": "Coronoavirus: No need to panic, says Kerala govt; patient stable.

It's very harmful,\" Mr Cui said in the interview that aired on Sunday (March 22). \n \"Eventually, we must have an answer to where the virus originally came from. But, this is the job for the scientists to do, not for diplomats.\" \n Mr Cui's comments represent a sharp public rebuke to Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who has publicly questioned whether the virus originated in China and even touted the idea that it may have been introduced by US Army athletes. \n Such public differences are rare among Chinese officials, who are famous for their ability to stick closely to the Communist Party's official line. \n Mr Cui is appointed directly by President Xi Jinping and holds a vice-ministerial rank in China's political hierarchy. \n That makes him two levels senior to Mr Zhao, whose official title is deputy director of the foreign ministry's Information Department. \n Mr Zhao continued to promote the theory on Sunday, retweeting speculation from a Twitter user who goes by the name \"the lizard king\" that Covid-19 has been around in America \"for a while\". \n The user is described as an \"fl transplant to the desert\", a \"mama\" and \"not an expert\". \n The ministry spokesman's statements have been echoed in official state media in recent days and have provoked anger in Washington. \n President Donald Trump has taken to calling the pathogen the \"Chinese virus\" and has blamed the US's outbreak on the Asian country's early failures to control the disease. \n \"As you know China tried to say at one point -- maybe they stopped now -- that it was caused by American soldiers,\" Mr Trump told reporters March 18. \"That can't happen. It's not going to happen, not as long as I'm president.

(Reuters) - The coronavirus-hit Chinese economy will grow at its slowest rate since the financial crisis in the current quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained.\nA Feb. 7-13 Reuters poll of 40 economists based in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, as well as Europe and the United States, predicted China’s annual economic growth in the first quarter of 2020 to slump to 4.5% from 6.0% in the previous quarter.\nThat drop was expected to drag down the full-year growth rate in 2020 to 5.5% from 6.1% in 2019, its weakest since at least 1990 when comparable records began.\nHowever, economists were optimistic the economy would bounce back as soon as the second quarter, with growth then forecast to recover to a median 5.7%, according to the poll.\nThat figure was pushed higher by several optimistic forecasts from economists based in mainland China. The range was 2.9%-6.5%.\nThe coronavirus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan - a nerve center in the global supply chain with a population of just under 11 million - and so far has claimed over 1,300 lives in China. That outstrips fatalities from the SARS outbreak in 2002-03 which killed 774 people worldwide.\n“Nobody knows the damage China’s virus containment efforts will have on growth, and we probably never will for sure, given the opacity of the statistics. We reckon true GDP growth will fall below 2% in Q1, from 4.0% in Q4, which already was substantially lower than the official 6.0%,” said Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon in London.\n“The lost production probably will be made up over the remainder of this year. But some service sector activity simply will be lost... people aren’t going to get their hair cut twice because they missed getting it cut in Q1, or buy two coffees to make up for missed consumption.”\n(Reuters poll graphic on coronavirus impact on the Chinese economy - here)\nThe enforced shutdown started during the Lunar New Year - usually the busiest time for most services businesses and according to most economists will accelerate an already-noticeable downturn before the outbreak.\nWhen asked to comment on what would happen to the economy if Chinese authorities failed to contain the virus from spreading rapidly, some mainland economists were reluctant to respond.\nGrowth was expected to slow to 3.5% in the first quarter in a worst-case scenario, according to a median from 15 economists in response to a separate question, with forecasts ranging between zero and 5.5%.\n“I think the virus will be under control by April. However, in the worst-case scenario, growth may fall to 2-3% in the first quarter and to 5% in (full-year) 2020,” said Bingnan Ye, senior macroeconomic analyst at Bank of China International in Beijing.\nTheir 2020 forecast matched the median worst-case outcome and lined up with the Chinese government’s forecast for the full-year economic growth rate to fall as much as 1 percentage point in 2020.\n“We do not expect a speedy recovery for the economy, even in the unlikely event that there are no new confirmed cases. After the coronavirus has been contained, it may still take four quarters to see a full recovery,” said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong.\n“Compared to 2003’s SARS, this is a lot more damaging.”\nSince then, China’s economic composition has changed significantly to become a more consumption and service-driven economy from being the world’s factory before.\nChina’s share of the global economy has quadrupled to 16% since the SARS outbreak, so any major disruption to economic activity is likely to have a bigger impact on the world economy now.\n“Every day is a deadline in February as Wuhan coronavirus data roll in,” noted Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG, the most accurate forecaster for Asian currencies in 2019. “For the yuan, the overall depreciation story continues.”\n(Reuters poll graphic on China economic outlook - here)\n"}, {"content": "O que é preciso saber sobre o vírus chinês sem nome: os riscos, os cuidados e como Portugal está preparado. A notícia do aparecimento de um novo vírus num mercado de peixe e marisco em Wuhan, uma cidade no centro da China, causou alarme internacional. Ainda estão frescas as memórias sobre o SARS e do MERS, outros dois coronavírus. Ambos surgidos já no presente século, provocaram um número elevado de mortes antes de finalmente serem controlados. O novo vírus, que por enquanto não tem nome mas provoca sintomas familiares como febre e dificuldades de respiração e já levou a dezenas de pneumonias, não parece ter o mesmo potencial de matar. Das pessoas infetadas já confirmadas, uma morreu e era alguém que já se encontrava gravemente enfraquecido por outras doenças. Em mais de 700 pessoas que tiveram contacto com os doentes, incluindo profissionais de saúde, nenhuma parece ter sido contaminada. No entanto, a possibilidade de transmissão limitada dentro de famílias não está descartada e esta semana a Organização Mundial de Saúde avisou os hospitais de todo o mundo que o novo vírus pode espalhar-se – um receio potenciado pela enorme deslocação de pessoas que vão acompanhar as celebrações do Ano Novo chinês até 25 de janeiro. Em Portugal, a Direção-Geral da Saúde referiu esta quarta-feira que não existem motivos para alarme. O Expresso falou com Raquel Guiomar, que recomenda: “Sempre que alguém se dirija a um hospital ou um consultório médico e tenha uma infeção respiratória, deve referir se fez alguma viagem recente, nomeadamente à China, onde foram identificados os casos deste vírus”.\nQue medidas estão a ser tomadas pelo Instituto Ricardo Jorge para enfrentar a potencial ameaça deste vírus? A nível do diagnóstico laboratorial, que é a missão deste instituto, estamos a seguir todas as indicações dadas pelas redes internacionais, nomeadamente pela Organização Mundial da Saúde, e estamos a estabelecer diagnóstico laboratorial específico para este coronavírus. O diagnóstico recomendado pela OMS foi divulgado terça-feira e estamos a implementá-lo para que rapidamente fique disponível. Além do diagnóstico, estamos a seguir outras orientações da OMS. Em todos os casos suspeitos, e que tenham ligação com a origem do surto, na China, esses doentes e os produtos deles serão testados para os agentes virais mais comuns que estejam associados a infeções respiratórias - e dos quais o instituto tem um vasto número de diagnósticos, nomeadamente a gripe, outros coronavírus humanos, adenovírus para influenza, e também os coronavírus que estiveram associados a surtos no início dos anos dois mil e agora mais recentemente, em especial o MERS e o SARS coronavírus. Em todos estes casos suspeitos é também recomendado fazer uma pesquisa de agentes respiratórios bacterianos e mesmo de outros agentes, como fungos oportunistas. Vai ser esse, portanto, o seguimento. O instituto também já tem implementada uma metodologia que permite o genoma quer de bactérias quer de vírus quer de fungos em amostras biológicas e que permitirá identificar este novo vírus.\nQue sintomas pode, levar uma pessoa a chamar a atenção como um eventual portador do novo vírus? O que tem sido recomendado, não só aos clínicos, mas também aos doentes, é que, sempre que alguém se dirija a um hospital ou a um consultório médico e tenha uma infeção respiratória, deve referir se fez alguma viagem recente, nomeadamente à China, onde foram identificados os casos deste vírus. E, tal como se fazia nos casos suspeitos do MERS coronavírus, tem de se garantir que até à confirmação do diagnóstico laboratorial – como um caso negativo ou positivo – o doente fica em condições de isolamento. Essa avaliação é feita pela Direção-Geral da Saúde e pelos médicos que têm essa função.As primeiras informações davam notícia de que ainda não havia sido confirmado que o vírus se podia transmitir entre humanos. Entretanto, houve o caso daquela pessoa que não passou pelo mercado em Wuhan, onde o surto terá começado, e no entanto contraiu o vírus.

CAPE TOWN - South African president Cyril Ramaphosa declared a national state of disaster on Sunday as he announced a range of measures to contain a COVID-19 outbreak that has so far infected 61 and showed the first signs of internal transmission.  \n In a live television broadcast after a special cabinet meeting, Ramaphosa said the outbreak, first detected on March 5, could have a significant and \"potentially lasting\" impact on a struggling economy, which is already in recession.  \n Measures to be taken include travel bans to countries such as Italy, Germany, China and the United States. The government will also prohibit gatherings of more than 100 people and cancel large events and celebrations, he said.  \n \"It is concerning we are now dealing with internal transmission of the virus. This situation calls for an extraordinary response, there can be no half measures,\" Ramaphosa said.  \n He said government has cancelled visas to visitors from high-risk countries from Sunday, with previously granted visas also revoked.  \n \"Any foreign national who has visited high-risk countries in the past 20 days will be denied a visa,\" he said, adding that South Africans who visited targeted countries would be subjected to testing and quarantine when returning home.  \n First detected two weeks ago with a single positive result, the number of cases has risen to 61 by Sunday, a mushrooming rate that mirrors the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.  \n The health ministry said earlier it had conducted 1,476 tests, with no fatalities. On Sunday, one of South Africa's top universities, Wits in the economic heartland Gauteng, instructed 350 students to immediately self-quarantine for two weeks after a classmate tested positive for COVID-19.  \n Besides the health impacts, Ramaphosa said the economy would not be spared as exports decline in key markets, including China, and the labour-intensive tourism sector suffers.  \n \"Cabinet is therefore in the process of finalising a comprehensive package of interventions to mitigate the expected impact of COVID-19 on the economy,\" he said. REUTERS \n "}, {"content": "China virus outbreak may wallop economy, financial markets. BANGKOK (AP) – News that a new virus that has afflicted hundreds of people in central China can spread between humans has rattled financial markets and raised concern it might wallop the economy just as it might be regaining momentum.Health authorities across Asia have been stepping up surveillance and other precautions to prevent a repeat of the disruptions and deaths during the 2003 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis, which caused USD40 billion-USD50 billion in losses from reduced travel and spending.The first cases of what has been identified as a novel coronavirus were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, suggesting animal-to-human transmission, but it now is also thought to be spread between people. As of yesterday, some 440 people were confirmed infected and nine had died from the illness, which can cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory symptoms.A retreat in financial markets on Tuesday was followed by a rebound yesterday, as investors snapped up bargains. Share benchmarks were mostly higher, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gaining 1.1 per cent and the Shanghai Composite index advancing 0.4 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 0.7 per cent.While the new virus appears much less dangerous than SARS, “the most significant Asia risk could lie ahead as the regional peak travel season takes hold, which could multiply the disease diffusion,” said Chief Asian strategist for AxiCorp Stephen Innes. “So, while the risk is returning to the market, the lights might not turn green until we move through the Lunar New Year travel season to better gauge the coronavirus dispersion.”The 2003 outbreak of SARS in China, along with cases of a deadly form of bird flu, resulted in widespread quarantine measures in many Chinese cities and in Hong Kong. More than 8,000 people fell sick and just under 800 people died, a mortality rate of under 10 per cent.While the ordinary flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, such new diseases raise alarm due to the uncertainties over how deadly they might be and how they might spread. That’s especially true during the annual mass travel of the Lunar New Year festival, which begins this week.“The cost to the global economy can be quite staggering in negative GDP terms if this outbreak reaches epidemic proportions as until this week, the market was underestimating the potential of the flu spreading,” Innes said in a report.In China, health officials stepped up screening for fevers. “We ask the public to avoid crowds and minimise the public gatherings to reduce the possibility of cross infection,” Deputy Director of the National Health Commission Li Bin said yesterday. Just as with SARS, though, the impact of the disease is likely to fall heaviest on specific industries, such as hotels and airlines, railways and other leisure businesses and retailers, analysts said. Most declined on Tuesday but rebounded yesterday as investors locked in profits ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. The outbreak is a boon, meanwhile, for pharmaceutical companies and makers of protective masks and other medical gear.“If the pneumonia couldn’t be contained in the short term, we expect China’s retail sales, tourism, hotel and catering, travel activities likely to be hit, especially in the first and second quarters,” said Ning Zhang of UBS. Government efforts to offset the shock would help, but growth will likely rebound less than earlier forecast, Zhang said.As of January 17, the World Health Organization (WHO) had not recommended any international restrictions on travel but urged local authorities to work with the travel industry to help prevent the disease from spreading while warning travellers who fall ill to seek medical attention.The illness is yet another blow for Hong Kong, whose economy is reeling from months of often violent anti-government protests. The wider concern is China, where the economy grew at a 30-year low 6.1 per cent annual pace in 2019. An interim trade pact between Beijing and Washington had raised hopes that some pressure from tensions between the two biggest economies might ease, and the latest data have showed signs of improved demand for exports. The virus outbreak raises the risk such optimism might be premature.“According to our analysis of the spread of the SARS virus, which so far appears very similar to 2019-nCoV (the new virus), we expect increased downward pressure on China’s growth, particularly in the services sector,” Ting Lu and other analysts at Nomura in Hong Kong said in a commentary.The growing number of global travellers has contributed to the spread of various diseases in recent years, including Middle East respiratory syndrome, the Ebola and Zika viruses, the plague, measles and other highly contagious illnesses.The World Economic Forum estimates that pandemics — cross-border outbreaks like the flu that killed 50 million people a century ago — have the potential to cause a USD570 billion in annual economic losses.The 2014-16 Ebola virus epidemic caused losses amounting to over USD2.2 billion, according to the World Bank. That includes a 40 per cent decrease in the number of working Liberians at the height of the crisis, lower exports and harvests, and costs for combating the disease.\n"}, {"content": "US army might have brought coronavirus to Wuhan, says China government spokesperson.

Wherever its origin may be, China and all the other affected countries are victims faced with the challenge in containing its spread,\" Zhao said.\nAsked on Thursday at a media briefing here whether China has proof that the coronavirus didn't originate in China and if so, where did it originate, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said the \"origin of the virus can only be determined by science. We need to rely on scientific and professional views.

Cases have been detected as far away as the United States.\nContrasting with its secrecy over the 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people, China’s communist government has this time given regular updates to try to avoid panic as millions travel for the Lunar New Year.\nAfter a meeting at its Geneva headquarters on Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it would decide on Thursday whether to declare the outbreak a global health emergency, which would step up the international response.\nIf it does so, it will be the sixth international public health emergency to be declared in the last decade.\n“This is an evolving and complex situation,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nAs it seeks to stop the spread of the virus, Wuhan’s local government said it would close all urban transport networks and suspend outgoing flights from the city as of 10 a.m. on Thursday (0200 GMT), state media reported, adding that the government said citizens should not leave the city unless there were special circumstances.\nThe measure was intended to “effectively cut off the transmission of the virus, resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic, and ensure the health and safety of the people,” state media cited Wuhan’s virus task-force as saying.\nWuhan’s move was praised by Ghebreyesus as a “very strong” measure that could minimize the risk of contagion.\n“If Wuhan is taking such drastic measures, we must assume widespread community transmission in this central China megacity & transport hub,” Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington, wrote in a tweet.\nWith more than 11 million people, Wuhan is central China’s main industrial and commercial center, home to the country’s largest inland port and gateway to its Three Gorges hydroelectric dam.\nThe latest death toll in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, rose to 17 by midday on Wednesday, state television quoted the provincial government as saying.\nHowever, the virus has already spread beyond the city to population centers including Beijing, Shanghai, Macau and Hong Kong.\nThe official China Daily newspaper said 544 cases had now been confirmed in the country.

Nach einem schwierigen Jahr etwa im deutschen Klinik-Geschäft will Fresenius seine Schwächephase hinter sich lassen.\nSo soll der Umsatz 2020 währungsbereinigt um bis zu 7 Prozent steigen und der Gewinn um bis zu 5 Prozent, wie der Dax-Konzern mitteilte. „Wir sind fest davon überzeugt, dieses Jahr wieder ein Ergebniswachstum zu erreichen“, sagte Vorstandschef Stephan Sturm am Donnerstag in Bad Homburg. Im vergangenen Jahr hatte der Gewinn währungsbereinigt stagniert.\nFür Gegenwind sorgt aber nun das Coronavirus. Fresenius mit den Sparten Kliniken, Flüssigarznei und Infusionen (Kabi) sowie der Dialysetochter FMC ist vor allem in Europa und den USA engagiert. Kabi hat aber Produktionsstätten in China, die wegen der neuartigen Lungenkrankheit stillstanden, sagte Sturm. Die Sparte werde die Folgen des Coronavirus beim verkauften Volumen zu spüren bekommen.\nIn der Volksrepublik sei der Zugang zu Krankenhäusern eingeschränkt und Lieferketten würden gestört. „Es wird viel aus Lagerbeständen gearbeitet“, sagte Sturm. Auch kämen viele Vorprodukte für Arzneien aus China. Je länger die Virus-Epidemie anhalte, desto wahrscheinlicher würden Engpässe.\nAuch hatte die Dialysetochter Fresenius Medical Care (FMNC) China zum Wachstumsmarkt erklärt. Weltweit gebe es dort die meisten Dialyse-Patienten, doch nur 45 Prozent der Chinesen mit chronischem Nierenversagen hätten Zugang zur einer Behandlung. Die Behandlungen in den Zentren gingen trotz des Coronavirus weiter, allerdings gebe es Probleme, Geräte für die Heimdialyse zu verkaufen. Wegen der Lungenkrankheiten bleiben viele Chinesen zu Hause.\nBeim Geschäftsausblick auf das laufende Jahr ließ Sturm dann auch eine Hintertür offen. Darin seien mögliche Folgen des Coronavirus nicht enthalten. Es sei zu früh, diese zu beziffern. Derzeit erwarte Fresenius keine signifikant negativen finanziellen Auswirkungen.\nFresenius mit gut 294.000 Beschäftigten weltweit hat ein holpriges Jahr hinter sich. So hatten im Klinikgeschäft sinkende Fallzahlen, der Trend zur ambulanten Behandlung und schärfere Vorschriften belastet. Bei Flüssigarznei und Infusionen kam der Konzern zudem in den USA unter Preisdruck. Sturm hatte 2019 zum Übergangsjahr erklärt und nach zwei Gewinnwarnungen in Folge mit viel Skepsis an der Börse zu kämpfen. Nun kletterten Fresenius-Aktien um mehr als 5 Prozent.\nIm vergangenen Jahr stieg der Konzernumsatz um 8 Prozent auf 35,5 Milliarden Euro. Der Gewinn wuchs unterm Strich um 2 Prozent auf 1,9 Milliarden Euro, ohne Wechselkurseffekte stagnierte er. „Das ist nicht unser Anspruch“, sagte Sturm.\nWährend die Dialysetochter Fresenius Medical Care im vierten Quartal zulegte, sanken die Ergebnisse mit Flüssigarzneien, Infusionen und klinischer Ernährung. Das Krankenhausgeschäft stabilisierte sich hingegen. Fresenius ist Deutschlands größter Krankenhausbetreiber und hatte über seine spanische Kliniktochter Quironsalud zuletzt mehrere Häuser in Kolumbien gekauft. Auch der Eintritt in ein drittes europäisches Land im Krankenhausgeschäft sei denkbar, betonte Sturm.\nFresenius sei gut für die Zukunft gerüstet, sagte er. „Deswegen blicken wir zuversichtlich nach vorne und bestätigen unsere ambitionierten Mittelfrist-Ziele.“ Die Aktionäre sollen eine höhere Dividende von 0,84 Euro je Aktie erhalten nach 0,80 Euro im Vorjahr.

La compañía coreana LG ha anunciado este martes en un comunicado que no acudirá al congreso mundial de móviles, que se celebrará en Barcelona entre el 24 y el 27 de febrero. Por su parte, la china ZTE ha desmentido en otra nota de prensa que no vaya a estar en la cita, tal y como se informó ayer por parte de The Verge, información de la que se hizo eco este periódico, y ha explicado que si bien cancela la rueda de prensa mantendrá su stand. Este periódico se ha puesto en contacto con la empresa china, que por el momento no ha confirmado cuál es la razón de la suspensión de la rueda de prensa. Por su parte, la GSMA, organizadora del congreso, considera \"mínimo\" el impacto del coronavirus sobre este evento hasta ahora, si bien ha redoblado las medidas preventivas y aconseja incluso evitar los apretones de manos para saludarse, según ha informado la organización en un comunicado actualizado anoche.\nLa compañía ZTE se ha limitado a sostener que \"la conferencia de prensa de dispositivos ZTE programada para el 25 de febrero, que es solo una de las múltiples actividades planificadas, ha sido cancelada. Sin embargo, sí mostraremos una amplia variedad de nuevos dispositivos 5G en el stand de ZTE durante el MWC 2020, según lo previsto\", ha asegurado ZTE.  El fabricante chino ha afirmado en un comunicado tomar “fuertes medidas de prevención” ante la escalada del coronavirus. “ZTE se asegurará de que todos los empleados de China continental, incluidos los que no son chinos, no presenten síntomas dos semanas antes de la salida y llegada al MWC. Además, en este momento, todos los empleados deben someterse a un autoaislamiento de dos semanas para garantizar la salud y la seguridad de todo nuestro personal”, indica el documento. Su stand en la feria, según el comunicado, se desinfectará diariamente y el personal en el mismo será de países de fuera de China —principalmente de Europa—.\nSeguridad\nLG ha explicado que la medida tiene como objetivo “anteponer la seguridad y la salud de sus empleados” evitando traslados entre diferentes países ante la crisis sanitaria. La marca prevé celebrar próximamente otros actos para anunciar sus nuevos móviles de 2020. Por su parte, ZTE explicó a The Verge que no celebrará la rueda de prensa por efectos secundarios relacionados con el coronavirus. Un portavoz ha explicado al medio estadounidense que están teniendo problemas como retrasos para conseguir las visas, por lo que algunos miembros de la compañía no llegarían a tiempo. Además, ha mostrado su intención de evitar el mal ambiente (The Verge habla de \"xenofobia\") que podría generar su presencia: \"Nosotros tendemos a ser una compañía muy amable, y simplemente no queremos hacer que la gente se sienta incómoda\".\n“LG Electronics está siguiendo y monitorizando de cerca la situación actual relacionada con el nuevo brote de coronavirus que fue declarado recientemente como una emergencia mundial por la Organización Mundial de la Salud, ya que el virus sigue propagándose fuera de China”, explica el comunicado de LG. Su decisión de no participar en el MWC, según sostiene, “evitará exponer innecesariamente a cientos de empleados de LG a viajes internacionales, algo que la mayoría de los expertos en salud han aconsejado”.\nHelena Devantares Mayoral, marketing manager de móviles en LG, ha explicado este miércoles a EL PAÍS que la compañía ha tomado la decisión velando por la seguridad y la salud de los empleados teniendo en cuenta que “es una feria internacional y hay asistencia de la mayor parte de países del mundo”. La decisión, según sostiene, “no afecta en absoluto a ninguna variable de la compañía”: “Nosotros vamos a seguir focalizándonos en el 5G y en la doble pantalla”.\nSobre si considera oportuno que el MWC se celebre pese a la escalada del brote, ha afirmado que LG respeta cualquier decisión que tome la organización. Y no descarta más cancelaciones. El fabricante coreano está analizando “uno a uno” todos los eventos en los que tenía previsto participar en los próximos meses. “Todos aquellos que conlleven un riesgo serán cancelados”, ha asegurado Devantares.\nEmergencia\nLa OMS declaró la semana pasada una emergencia internacional por el coronavirus. Los primeros casos se detectaron a finales de diciembre en Wuhan. Ahora ya hay más de 23.000 personas infectadas y el número de muertos supera los 490 en China. La cifra de países afectados ronda la veintena. En España, por el momento solo se ha confirmado un caso. El paciente, de nacionalidad alemana, se encuentra ingresado y aislado en el Hospital Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de La Gomera.\nEn el evento se dan cita las principales compañías de la industria de la telefonía móvil. La GSMA, organizadora del Mobile, prevé que en 2020 acudan al congreso más de 109.000 personas de casi 200 países. En los últimos dos años, la presencia asiática en el congreso ha aumentado de un 14% a un 16%, según un informe del evento publicado por la GSMA en 2019. El año pasado, un 6% de los asistentes eran de China.\nLa compañía coreana acostumbra a presentar nuevos terminales cada año en el MWC. Por ejemplo, en 2019 mostró el LG G8 ThinQ, un móvil llamativo porque se puede controlar con gestos, y el LG V50 ThinQ 5G, su primer dispositivo compatible con la tecnología 5G y que cuenta, además, con una pantalla doble. En esta ocasión la marca tenía previsto presentar dispositivos en el congreso. También ofrecía la posibilidad de cerrar citas con especialistas para conocer su nueva gama de smartphones para 2020.\nLG tuvo en 2019 unos ingresos de 53.000 millones de dólares, la mayoría provenientes de la venta de electrodomésticos y productos de Home Entertainment, como sus televisiones. En el mercado de móviles ocupa el séptimo puesto mundial con una cuota del 3%, según la consultora IHS. ZTE tenía una cuota del 2% en 2018, según los datos de Counterpoint Research Market Monitor.\nEl anuncio de LG llega solo unos días después de que la GSMA asegurara en un comunicado que la feria se celebrará según lo previsto: \"El próximo evento del MWC Barcelona se llevará a cabo según lo planeado en todos los lugares de la Fira Gran Vía y Fira Montjuïc, incluidos YoMo y Four Years From Now (4YFN)\". La organización afirma además estar analizando y evaluando el impacto potencial del brote del coronavirus.\nSegún se explica en el mismo, se proporcionará asistencia médica adicional en los espacios en los que tendrá lugar el MWC “en el periodo previo y durante la celebración del evento”. La organización subraya que está trabajando con Fira de Barcelona para asegurar \"suficientes productos desinfectantes en todos los lugares\". Por ejemplo, planea implementar un programa de limpieza y desinfección en los espacios donde hay una mayor probabilidad de contacto: desde las zonas de restauración a los servicios o los espacios con pantallas táctiles.\n \n"}, {"content": "China reports 2nd death from virus behind pneumonia outbreak. A second person has died from a new coronavirus that has caused an outbreak of pneumonia in central China, health authorities said.\nA 69-year-old man surnamed Xiong fell ill with the respiratory condition on Dec. 31, according to a statement late Thursday from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. He died Wednesday.\nXiong exhibited abnormal renal function, severe impairment in multiple organs, inflammation of the heart muscle and other pressing conditions when he was admitted to the hospital. It was not clear from the commission’s statement whether these were preexisting issues or consequences of the viral pneumonia.\nIn total, 41 people in Wuhan have been diagnosed with a novel coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause both the common cold and more severe diseases like SARS and MERS. As of late Thursday, 12 patients have been cured and discharged and five were being treated for acute conditions.\nXiong’s is the second death associated with the outbreak. Last Saturday, a 61-year-old man who had abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease died.\nAuthorities have tracked more than 700 people who were in close contact with infected patients. Among them, no related cases have been found. However, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has not ruled out limited human-to-human transmission, revealing a woman may have contracted the virus from her husband.\nThe Chinese government is keen to avoid a repeat of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The SARS epidemic began in southern China in late 2002, then spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800 people.\nMost of the coronavirus patients this time either worked at or visited a particular seafood market in Wuhan. The market has since been shut down for investigation and disinfection.\nTwo patients in Thailand and another in Japan have been diagnosed with the virus.\nA 74-year-old tourist was intercepted at a Thai airport on Jan. 13 with symptoms of lung infection, the country’s public health ministry said Friday. She is being treated in the same hospital, east of Bangkok, as a Chinese woman who was diagnosed with the virus after entering the country last week.\nThe Chinese woman is getting better and will soon be released, said Sukhum Kanchanapimai, Thailand’s permanent secretary for public health.\nJapan’s health ministry said Thursday the virus had been confirmed in a man who had been hospitalized in Japan with pneumonia symptoms after traveling to Wuhan earlier this month. His condition has improved. Kyodo News agency reported the man is Chinese.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: WHO is doing its job; stop attacking its chief for praising China | Opinion. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has been at the forefront in fighting this health crisis under the leadership of its Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Since December 31, 2019, when WHO was first informed about pneumonia cases in Wuhan emanating from \"unknown causes\", the WHO has been actively monitoring the situation and holding consultations at different levels.\nThese include declaring the outbreak an international health emergency, mobilising the international scientific community to come together to fight coronavirus, and issuing safety precautions and guidelines for general public, businesses, governments, hospitals and other stakeholders, among other measures.\nAs WHO chief, Dr Ghebreyesus flew in to China to meet President Xi Jinping, and a WHO team comprising of international health experts is already operating in China. Dr Ghebreyesus has also been interacting with world leaders, spearheading calls for research collaborations and raising funds to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.\nBut these efforts by the WHO in the face of a global health emergency, about which very little is known, seem to be of little consideration for a section of society that has unleashed a brutal attack against Dr Ghebreyesus on social media.\nThe attack is not only personal in nature, but also seeks to tarnish his professional image by questioning his credentials and commitment.\n'CHINA'S LAP DOG'\nDr Ghebreyesus has been accused of conspiring with China in its \"propaganda\" to hush-up coronavirus cases. Many have gone on to call him \"China's lap dog\", say he is \"irresponsible and coward\", and accuse him of \"jeopardising the world for his private profit\", among other charges.\nThe WHO chief's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his tweets praising the country's leadership for its \"determination to end the new coronavirus outbreak\" too have not gone down well with many social media users.\nThe petition blames Dr Ghebreyesus for the rising coronavirus cases and resultant deaths, and says this is partly because of his underestimation of the outbreak.\n\"We strongly think he is not fit for his role as WHO Director General. We call for the immediate resignation of Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. A lot of us are really disappointed. We believe WHO is supposed to be politically neutral,\" the petition reads. Its comment section, where people mention why they are signing the petition, is filled with derogatory remarks that are unmentionable.\nIn short, Dr Ghebreyesus is being hounded online on two counts:\nMISPLACED ANGER\nPeople's concerns and anxiety about the coronavirus outbreak are understandable but that cannot be an excuse to malign the WHO or its chief. In times of an epidemic of this magnitude, people, irrespective of national boundaries and political leanings, need to stand united and support individuals and organisations that are working on ground to tackle the crisis.\nHurling personal attacks on individuals leading such efforts doesn't help improve the situation, but rather often proves to be counterproductive. It infuses negativity in public discourse, which in turn tends to cast aspersions on genuine efforts--a breeding ground for suspicion and misinformation.\nSecondly, one may have a hundred differences with China and what its political system and leadership stands for. But is this really the time to attack and malign the nation?\nBefore attacking Dr Ghebreyesus for meeting President Xi Jinping and praising his government's efforts against coronavirus, one must realise that besides leading an international health organisation in the midst of an epidemic, Dr Ghebreyesus also has to negotiate various diplomatic hurdles in forging an international coalition against the epidemic. With regards to coronavirus, this global effort is simply impossible if China is not on board.\nFaced with such a sensitive situation, the WHO chief cannot afford to upset the Chinese leadership, even if there are some shortcomings on ground. A confrontational approach against President Xi Jinping is likely to snowball and prove futile when it comes to controlling the situation.\nThose who are calling Dr Ghebreyesus names and demanding his resignation must answer if they think China would have allowed a WHO team comprising international health experts to visit coronavirus-hit regions and investigate the situation had the health body's chief confronted President Xi and talked bitter about him.\nThe reality today is that thousands of people are suffering in China. Many have died and many more are likely to die in the coming days. Priority for the global community right now should be to control the situation, not to embroil itself in mudslinging and waste its energy by pointing fingers in a show of one-upmanship. Investigations into who and what went wrong (if at all) can wait. Saving lives can't.\nDr Ghebreyesus's success in convincing China to allow a team of international health experts to visit coronavirus-affected regions is nothing short of a major diplomatic success. If at all China deliberately hid facts or underreported the situation, as is alleged, it will be known to the world in due course when these international experts document their observations.\nWhy do we have to jump into conclusions without any evidence and tarnish the image of hardworking health workers who have been slogging day in out treating patients? Those leading the vitriol online attack against the WHO and its chief must answer if slander, malice and a hatred-filled anti-China campaign is how these tireless medicos deserve to be treated with for their services.\nThe other reason why the WHO and Dr Ghebreyesus are being attacked stems from the argument that Dr Ghebreyesus didn't declare coronavirus outbreak an international health emergency at an earlier date.\nThose forwarding this argument must understand that decisions to declare an international emergency cannot be based on one person's whims and fancies. Far from being a one-person show, it involves rigorous assessments and deliberations between various stakeholders, all of which takes time. Even before declaring it an international health emergency, the WHO had been rigorously following up on research and treatment of coronavirus patients in China.\nHowever, none of this means China, the WHO or Dr Ghebreyesus are above questioning. One must question them by all means, but personal attacks and a campaign aimed at tarnishing individuals and maligning an entire country is definitely not the way to do so.\n"}, {"content": "PSI20 e bolsas europeias sofrem com receios de contágio do vírus chinês.

JAKARTA — Indonesia's health minister defended the country's screening process for coronavirus on Thursday (Feb 28) and said the absence of confirmed cases in the world's fourth-most populous nation was a \"blessing from the Almighty\". \n The sprawling Southeast Asian country of more than 260 million people has not recorded any cases though some of its citizens overseas have contracted the virus, including eight crew on the Diamond Princess cruise liner off Japan's Yokohama. \n Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto said 134 test samples taken from people suspected of having the coronavirus had turned out negative. \n \"If until this second all came out negative, then it's a blessing from the Almighty,\" he told reporters. \n Mr Putranto said tests on two patients who died this week after suffering symptoms associated with contracting the virus had been negative. \n On Feb 23, a Singaporean man died after reportedly suffering fever and shortness of breath in the city of Batam, but the head of the local health agency said this was due to another unspecified disease. \n The death of a 37-year-old man in Semarang in Central Java who was suffering pneumonia after returning from overseas was not caused by the coronavirus, but by H1N1 flu, he said. \n Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in the United States, said in a study this month that Indonesia should strengthen outbreak surveillance and control — especially as it had direct flights from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. \n The Harvard team said Indonesia's lack of confirmed cases \"may suggest the potential for undetected cases\" as air travel may contribute to cases being exported from China. \n WHO IS \"QUITE CONFIDENT\" \n Indonesia has barred entry to visitors who have been in China for 14 days and stopped all flights to and from there. \n Indonesia has tested relatively few people in comparison to some neighbours and its population, but Mr Putranto said tests were conducted when \"doctors determine they have symptoms that point to that direction.\" \n \"Imagine if everybody who had a cough or flu was checked, then millions would be checked,\" he said. \n Mr Navaratnasamy Paranietharan, the World Health Organization's Indonesia representative, has said the WHO was \"quite confident that Indonesia is ready to be able to respond to this situation.\" \n Separately, Indonesia will send a Garuda Indonesia plane in the next few days to Japan to pick up 68 of its citizens working aboard the coronavirus-affected Diamond Princess, officials said. \n The crew could be quarantined for up to 28 days on Sebaru island in the Java Sea north off Jakarta, where 188 crew members from another cruise ship are also being held in quarantine. \n The coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people globally and killed nearly 2,800, the majority in China.

We can't even call an Uber. So we're basically stuck in the same area and can't really do the fun things that we used to do, like hang out with friends or play football.\"\nThere has been no official announcement so far as to when the lockdown will be lifted, but according to Chisenga, police are suggesting that schools could reopen at the end of the month.\nLove of China\nThe 25-year-old is one of 200 Zambian students currently stranded in Wuhan.\nZambia has resisted calls to repatriate the students, out of fears the virus could spread further.\n\"It's really shocking for me that they decided that we should stay put and rely on the help that we're getting from the Chinese government,\" Chisenga commented.\nIll-equipped, health systems in many African countries are scrambling to prepare for a potential outbreak of the highly infectious disease.\n\"After being here for so long, I'm starting to feel like we should stay, we’re able to beat this from here,\" continues Chisenga, who already sees an end to the virus.\nOnce a cure is found, he hopes to pursue a Masters degree at Wuhan University, refusing to give in to prejudice against Chinese people.\n\"China is like a second home to me and Chinese people are very friendly.

O profissional contacta a linha de apoio médico para validação do caso como suspeito, haverá recolha de material para análise e a pessoa será encaminhada para o hospital de referência. Perante um caso positivo, se tiver acontecido contacto próximo com outro dos repatriados sem uso de máscara será necessário que recomecem o ciclo de quarentena.\nQuestionada novamente sobre a questão do isolamento e medidas a aplicar a outros cidadãos que venham da China Marta Temido lembrou que a legislação permite, em situações excepcionais que não se verificam, ditar a separação de pessoas de forma a assegurar a saúde dos próprios e de terceiros.\n“São medidas de excepção sempre dependentes de alguma ponderação, critérios de proporcionalidade e da legislação. Essa eventualidade não se coloca, mas sabemos que existem mecanismos de que dispomos e usaremos se necessário para garantir que os próprios ficam em situações de segurança, assim como a comunidade geral”, explicou a ministra. \nGraça Freitas voltou a reforçar que este grupo de cidadãos é especial por ter estado pelo menos 30 dias no epicentro de uma nova doença e que por isso foi tratado com medidas especiais. “Estes cidadãos não são iguais aos outros que possam vir da China. Foi por isso que Ministério da Saúde decidiu trata-los de forma especial. Outros que cheguem em risco semelhante terão tratamento semelhante. Para risco diferente, tratamento diferente”, salientou a directora-geral da Saúde.\nPortugal tem neste momento três hospitais de referência para casos suspeitos de infecção pelo novo coronavírus e duas ambulâncias especializadas para a deslocação destes casos. A demora na deslocação de um caso suspeito em Felgueiras para o Hospital de São João levou o Sindicato dos Técnicos de Emergência Pré-Hospitalar a tecer várias criticas sobre o material disponibilizado nas ambulâncias, meios disponíveis noutros pontos do país e informação disponível.\nGraça Freitas explicou que nesta primeira fase, cujo nível é de contenção da doença, é preciso ter uma “linha muito restrita de serviço de primeira linha, com um laboratório muito bem preparado e número profissionais com muita capacidade”. Nesta altura disse estarem a trabalhar com o Instituto Nacional de Saúde Dr. Ricardo Jorge (Insa) e com as administrações Regionais de Saúde já a pensar numa segunda linha de resposta com mais laboratórios, rede de transporte e outros hospitais envolvidos.\nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\nQuestionada sobre qual o protocolo neste momento caso apareça um caso suspeito por exemplo nos Açores ou na Madeira, a responsável adiantou que o doente ficará à partida numa unidade hospitalar da região autónoma e caso não exista capacidade laboratorial na zona, será a amostra biológica a ser enviada para Lisboa para realização dos testes no laboratório de referência. O presidente do Insa Fernando Almeida salientou que o instituto trabalha em rede com outros 20 laboratórios nacionais, incluindo nas ilhas, e que todos têm a tecnologia necessária para realizar os testes.\nMarta Temido acrescentou que está em curso uma avaliação ao que se passou com os dois casos suspeitos que Portugal já registou, um em Lisboa e outro no Porto. “Já temos a recolha de toda a linha do tempo e iremos fazer uma análise interna detalhada para ver o que correu menos bem e avaliar medidas a tomar.”\nA ministra acrescentou que já esta segunda-feira falou com o presidente do INEM sobre a necessidade de reformular a informação e o material disponível junto de todos os parceiros que trabalham com aquela entidade. E que esta terça-feira haverá uma reunião do Conselho Nacional de Saúde Pública para reflectirem sobre a capacidade de resposta de cada entidade.\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 2-Cambodia to allow cruise ship shunned over virus fears to dock. HANOI/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Cambodia has agreed to let a cruise ship that has been turned away by five countries over fears that someone aboard may have the coronavirus dock and disembark its passengers, the Holland America Line said on Wednesday.\nFor nearly two weeks, the MS Westerdam, a ship of healthy passengers, had been sailing throughout Asia after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines over fears that someone on the cruise could have the new flu-like virus that has killed more than 1,100 people, almost all of them in China.\n“We will immediately begin making our way to Sihanoukville in Cambodia,” Westerdam captain Vincent Smit told passengers, according to a recording of the announcement reviewed by Reuters.\n“There will be a brief health inspection on board by the Cambodian authorities which will take place at anchor just before we arrive alongside,” said Smit.\nThe ship is expected to arrive in Cambodia around 7 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Thursday, he said.\nThe latest country to shun the ship, which has 1,455 passengers and 802 crew on board, had been Thailand, where the health minister refused to grant the Westerdam permission to dock.\n“The staff has tried to bolster spirits but you can only play so many games of trivia,” Angela Jones, a business consultant from the U.S. state of Georgia, told Reuters in a video recording sent before the news that Cambodia would take the ship. “I’ve asked others who say they are napping a lot.”\nLike many on board, Jones had embarked in Hong Kong for a much-anticipated cruise through the region in early February. It was scheduled to be a two-week cruise, but with that period running out this week, there had been worries about fuel and food supplies. Many on board are elderly and there was also concerns they could be running out of medicines.\nTo kill time and break up the monotony of endless ocean scrolling past cabin windows, the ship’s crew have organised dozens of activities to keep people occupied, tourists on board the vessel told Reuters.\nPeople could be seen playing chess and doing puzzles on Wednesday, in some of the first pictures published by media of life aboard the ship.\nOther activities on offer included colouring-in for adults; teeth whitening; poker tournaments; whisky tasting; even a lecture on modern China which delved into the economics of collective farming, according to passengers on board and a copy of the ship’s activity programme seen by Reuters.\nPassengers on board the ship have been subjected to regular health checks, according to Holland America, the ship operator and a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp (CCL.N). There have been no reported cases of the coronavirus on board.\nStoking fears of authorities in countries on the ship’s route has been the ongoing quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp. A total of 175 out of the 3,700 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the coronavirus.\nLate on Wednesday, the Westerdam changed its course away from Bangkok and began heading towards Cambodia, according to data published by the Marine Traffic ship tracking website.\nEarlier, the Thai Navy “Bhumibol Adulyadej” warship could be seen escorting the Westerdam in waters just off the Thai coast, according to passengers and Marine Traffic.\nDespite the uncertainty, crew members had staged a farewell ceremony for passengers on Wednesday morning, singing to the tune of the 1979 hit “We Are Family” by Sister Sledge.\nElsewhere on board, the patience of some passengers has been tested by the prolonged uncertainty, Jones said, as some people pushed and shoved for access to one of the ship’s only available computers and printers, to re-book flights home.\n“Hard to imagine these senior cruisers coming to blows but guess that happened,” said Jones. “It’s funny and sad at the same time”.\n"}, {"content": "US, China trade barbs over 'Chinese Virus'. United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday defended calling the coronavirus spreading rapidly across the world the \"Chinese Virus\" and said that he is pushing back against the false narrative of China that the US military did this.\n\n\"Well, China was putting out information which was false that our military did this to them. That was false. And rather than having an argument, I said I had to call it where it came from. It did come from China,\" the president told reporters at a White House news conference.\n\"So I think it's a very accurate term. I didn't appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them. Our military did not give it to anybody,\" Trump said.\nAn hour later, he started his meeting with CEOs of the hotel and tourism industry by using the term \"China Virus\".\nTrump refuted the notion that his using of the phrase created a stigma against the Chinese.\n\"I don't think so. I think saying that our military did to them creates a stigma,\" he asserted.\nDuring the news conference, Trump said he took the right decision by imposing a travel ban on China.\nHe replied in the negative when asked about disruption in the supply chain given that many precursors for pharmaceuticals come from China.\n\"No, I don't see that at all and I think China has every incentive to make sure that things work well. China wants to make sure that things work very well,\" Trump said.\nThe US President said he did not expect China not honouring its trade deal commitment of buying things from the US as a result of the coronavirus.\n\"Well they need our product very badly... We have a good relationship with China. We have a signed agreement. They're going to be buying and they have been buying a lot of product,\" he said.\nRight now, he said, China has been sending the US everything it needs. \"But we are looking at some alternatives,\" he added.\nThe US and China have sparred over the origin of the virus for days, with a Chinese official promoting conspiracy theories claiming it was brought to China by the US army and Beijing accusing American officials of stigmatizing an entire nation.\nIn his original tweet on Monday, Trump described US airlines and other industries being \"particularly affected by the Chinese Virus\".\nOn Tuesday, he tweeted that some US states were \"being hit hard by the Chinese Virus\".\nTrump's allies had previously referred to the pandemic as the \"Chinese coronavirus\", but Beijing said it was \"strongly indignant\" over the phrase, which it called \"a kind of stigmatization\".\nThe US should \"immediately stop its unjustified accusations against China,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing.\nA commentary by the official Xinhua news agency said using \"racist and xenophobic names to cast blame for the outbreak on other countries can only reveal politicians' irresponsibility and incompetence which will intensify virus fears.\"\nThe war of words reignited diplomatic tensions between the two countries, which have tussled over trade and other disputes since Trump took office.\nTrump's comments were also criticized inside the US, with warnings it could incite a backlash against the Asian-American community.\n\"Our Asian-American communities -- people YOU serve -- are already suffering. They don't need you fuelling more bigotry,\" tweeted New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose state is one of the hardest-hit by the virus in the country.\nThe World Health Organization said more cases and deaths had been reported in the rest of the world than in China.\nThe new coronavirus was first detected late last year, with China's own health officials initially saying its source was a live animal market in the central city of Wuhan, whose government had initially tried to cover up the outbreak.\nBut China has sought to distance itself from the virus, saying the origin is still unknown, while seeking global goodwill by offering aid to countries facing serious outbreaks.\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a phone call he initiated with top Chinese official Yang Jiechi, voiced anger that Beijing has used official channels \"to shift blame for COVID-19 to the US\", the State Department said.\nPompeo \"stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumours, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat\", the department added.\nThe State Department on Friday summoned Chinese ambassador Cui Tiankai to denounce Beijing's promotion of a conspiracy theory that had gained wide attention on social media.\nForeign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested on Twitter last week that \"patient zero\" in the global pandemic may have come from the US.\n\"It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation,\" tweeted Zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media.\nPompeo himself has sought to link China to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to the \"Wuhan virus\" despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatizing.\nYang issued a \"stern warning to the US that any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail\", Xinhua said in its summary of the call with Pompeo.\nThe key Chinese foreign policy leader \"noted that some US politicians have frequently slandered China and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatized the country, which has enraged the Chinese people\", Xinhua said.\nYang called on the US side to \"correct its wrongful behaviour\".\nTrump is under fire over his handling of the pandemic, and his backers have sought to cast the coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners.\nWhile COVID-19 has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries.\n"}, {"content": "why are malaria pills being used against coronavirus?. Older malaria drugs are being studied, and in some cases used, to treat or try to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, even though there is no firm evidence to show they are effective.  \n Studies are underway in a number of countries, including China, France and the United States, to see whether the pills - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - may have a role to play in the rapidly spreading pandemic.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has touted the malaria drugs as \"a game changer.\" But the Food and Drug Administration and other health experts said trials must first ensure the medicines are effective and safe for use in this patient population.  \n  \n WHY ARE MALARIA DRUGS UNDER CONSIDERATION? There are currently no vaccines or U.S.-approved treatments for the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that has killed more than 18,000 worldwide, so even the most severely ill patients largely receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.  \n On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotal use of hydroxychloroquine at different doses.  \n Chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found on the bark of the cinchona plant. It has been used for hundreds of years in South America to treat fever.  \n Chloroquine was first synthesized in the 1930s. A version called hydroxychloroquine, in use since the 1950s, is considered to be less toxic, according to studies. Both drugs can cause serious side effects, including vision loss, heart problems or even death, if used incorrectly.  \n The drugs are used to combat malaria, which is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites, because they interrupt its ability to digest a host's blood cells.  \n Scientists have detailed biochemical proprieties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections. These include direct antiviral effects, such as blocking steps needed by certain viruses to replicate, and its ability to suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.  \n In addition to malaria, hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  \n  \n WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY?  \n Data has begun to emerge from some coronavirus trials, but most information so far is preliminary.  \n A French team last week said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo. But the trial is small and results on patient outcomes are still awaited.  \n Chinese researchers last month reported trial results showing that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group.  \n It has been added as a recommended treatment for the illness in China, where the virus first emerged in December.  \n This week, the Journal of Zhejiang University reported disappointing results from a 30-patient Shanghai study of hydroxychloroquine. It showed the drug worked no better than standard care for patients with COVID-19.  \n The University of Minnesota has launched a 1,500-person trial to see whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 in people exposed to the virus - including healthcare workers and family members of infected people.  \n Other trials of the malaria drugs are ongoing or set to start in the United Kingdom, Norway and Thailand.  \n New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak with more than 25,000 cases, on Sunday said it had acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of the malaria drugs to use in a clinical trial.  \n  \n IS THERE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND?  \n In the United States, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have already spiked and are in short supply, according to pharmacists.  \n Several makers of the generic medicines said they are increasing production of chloroquine pills. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd <TEVA.TA>, Mylan NV <MYL.O> and Bayer AG <BAYGn.DE> have donated large quantities of the drugs to health authorities.  \n  \n PRESCRIPTION ONLY!  \n Health officials caution that no one should be taking these drugs to treat or prevent coronavirus infection without medical supervision and a prescription.  \n In Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after taking a nonmedical form of chloroquine used to fight parasites in aquariums. \"Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,” said Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the poison and drug information center at Arizona-based Banner Health.

We can push this coronavirus back,\" he said.\n\"Your actions now will determine the course of the COVID-19 outbreak in your country. There's no choice but to act now,\" he said.\nWHO has been advising countries to take actions on the \"first case, first cluster, first evidence of community transmission.\"\nMeanwhile, Ghebreyesus also deplored stigmatizing during the outbreak, which he said is \"more dangerous than coronavirus itself.\"\n\"It is painful to witness the level of stigma we are seeing.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investment-advisors are increasingly worried that U.S. authorities are not be doing enough to prevent a widespread outbreak of coronavirus in the country, potentially adding further downside to already-battered markets.\nTheir criticisms include the number of people so far tested by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which some say is too small, the possible difficulties of imposing lockdowns on U.S. cities and concerns that the White House could bungle containment efforts.\nThe worries have magnified the uncertainty that has accompanied the coronavirus outbreak over the last several weeks, as investors scramble to adjust their portfolios to price in the virus’ potential for damage to the global economy and assess its further impact on asset prices.\nThe CDC states on its website that “as of Feb. 24, CDC teams are working with the Department of Homeland Security at 11 airports where all flights from China are being directed to screen travelers returning to the United States, and to refer them to U.S. health departments for oversight of self-monitoring.”\nU.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar said as of Thursday morning the CDC had tested 3,625 specimens for the fast-moving virus.\nFor some investors and analysts, those assurances ring hollow.\n“Much of what we’ve seen about this virus has shaken confidence in governments,” said James Bianco, head of Chicago-based advisory firm Bianco Research.\nHis list includes doubts over China’s accuracy in counting cases, criticism over Japan’s handling of a cruise ship quarantine at one of its ports, and the comparatively small number of people that U.S. authorities have so far tested.\nWorries over the growing number of cases outside China sent the S&P 500 into intraday correction territory on Thursday morning. Stocks took an earlier hit on Wednesday after health officials in Nassau County, New York, said they were monitoring 83 people who visited China and may have come in contact with the coronavirus. Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state has had no confirmed cases so far. [L2N2AQ192]\nOn Wednesday evening, U.S. President Donald Trump told Americans that the risk from coronavirus remained “very low,” and appointed Vice President Mike Pence to run the U.S. response to the looming global health crisis.\nBianco said he fears many investors are still complacent about how quickly the number of cases could multiply in the United States, as it has in countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea.\nHe is advising his clients to tread lightly until the full extent of the outbreak is known.\n“I would rather risk a lost opportunity by being out of the market or underweight and finding out that this is not a big deal, than being fully invested and worrying that this will get worse,” Bianco said.\nOthers are concerned over the consequences if the United States were forced to implement a lockdown similar to the one imposed by Chinese authorities on Hubei Province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.\nWuhan, Hubei’s capital, imposed strict controls on movement of residents, then eased them, then later announced that the relaxation had been revoked. Such measures could be more difficult to enforce in the United States.\n“Those of us sitting here in Hong Kong looking at financial markets think there is a tremendous amount of risk in the system,” said Simon Powell, equity strategist at Jefferies in Hong Kong.\nPowell is particularly worried that there could be spread of the virus from people from countries outside China which were not subject to travel restrictions coming into the United States. He is particularly concerned about the outbreak in Iran.\nIran said on Thursday that its coronavirus death toll had risen to 26, by far the highest number outside China. The death rate among confirmed cases of the virus has been running at around 10% in Iran compared to around 3% elsewhere.\nPowell also thinks that a Trump government is unlikely to choose reduced economic activity , writing in a recent research note that “our base case hypothesis is that a Trump government is unlikely to choose reduced economic activity, and supply chain disruption, so spread of the virus, if it were to emerge in the US, would be more likely.”\nOthers have pointed to what they believe are shortcomings in the CDC’s approach.\n“The initial response from the U.S. has been targeted to mount a response to confirmed high-risk or infected cases, not directed to a more generalized public health containment,” said Wouter Jongbloed, head of policy and risk analysis at New York-based Exante Data.\nWith coronavirus having spread well outside China, CDC testing was “likely insufficiently effective in preventing a potential outbreak in the U.S.,” Jongbloed said.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus outbreak stops supply of Chinese products, Mumbai traders wary of future.

It comes from China,” Mr Trump said. \n “Not think; I know,” he said when asked again whether it was definitive that the virus originated from China. \n Last Thursday, Beijing’s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, wrote on Twitter that the virus may have originated from the US Army, which took part in Military World Games in Wuhan last October. In response, the US summoned China’s Washington ambassador Cui Tiankai this week to complain about the tweet. \n In posts on the social media platform, which is banned in China, Zhao also shared articles from the Canadian conspiracy site Global Research that suggested Covid-19 had originated in the US. \n At Wednesday’s media conference, Mr Trump demurred when asked about a CBS reporter’s Twitter post on Tuesday that a White House official had referred to the virus as “Kung Flu” during a private conversation. “No, not at all,” he said when asked if the term put Asian-Americans at risk. “They probably would agree with it 100 per cent, it comes from China.” \n Mr Trump also said he had no plans to ease tariffs on China, amid calls for him to do so by American industry groups. “China is paying us billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, and there's no reason to do that. They haven't even spoken to me about that,” the president said. \n The press conference – the third consecutive daily briefing fronted by Mr Trump — saw a continuation of his dramatic shift of tone regarding the virus, after weeks of downplaying its severity. “We're going to defeat the invisible enemy, I think we're going to do it even faster than we thought,” Mr Trump said. “And it will be a complete victory. It'll be a total victory.” \n The president’s comments came as already-strained ties between the two superpowers further soured this week, with both sides trading barbs — and conspiracy theories — over who was ultimately responsible for the spread of the coronavirus. \n China has reacted with fury at Trump’s and his Republican allies’ insistence on calling the ailment the “Chinese coronavirus” or the “Wuhan virus”. \n Those names ignore the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) repeated calls for all countries to use the officially assigned terminology — Covid-19 for the disease, and SARS-CoV-2 for the virus that causes the illness. \n While epidemics’ names in the past had been based on where most of the infections occurred, the WHO in 2015 issued new guidelines to avoid contagions being identified by geography; the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome was one such example. \n The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus in a statement on Tuesday said referring to Covid-19 as the “Chinese virus” was akin to “telling people who to blame, they are telling people who to fear and who to hate”. \n “Unfortunately, we have already seen how this bigotry has impacted Asian-Americans across the country who are facing increased prejudice and violence,” the group said, adding that many from the community had been assaulted to the point of requiring medical care in hospitals. \n “This is the consequence of spreading xenophobia, something that cannot continue to be amplified by the Trump administration and Republican members. Not now, not ever.” \n China, too, has fanned diplomatic flames. In recent weeks, with the outbreak easing across the mainland, senior diplomatic officials have parroted the theory that the virus did not originate in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, as has been widely presumed by scientists. \n Beijing also provoked anger in Washington on Tuesday when it moved to expel at least 13 American journalists from China by revoking their visas in retaliation for Washington’s move last month to curb the number of journalist visas it issued to staff from five Chinese state-owned media outlets. \n The Chinese action affects journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. \n Asked for reaction to the journalists’ impending expulsion, Mr Trump — who frequently disparages “fake news” outlets he does not like — said: “I am not happy to see it. I have my own disputes with all three of those media groups. I think you know that very well, but I don't like seeing that at all.” SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST \n "}, {"content": "Coronavirus may have infected 500,000 in Wuhan by peak in coming weeks. MELBOURNE (BLOOMBERG) - The new coronavirus might have infected at least 500,000 people in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of the global outbreak, by the time it peaks in coming weeks. \n The typically bustling megacity, where the so-called 2019-nCoV virus emerged late last year, has been in effective lockdown since Jan 23, restricting the movement of 11 million people. Recent trends in reported cases in Wuhan broadly support the preliminary mathematical modelling the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is using to predict the epidemic's transmission dynamics. \n \"Assuming current trends continue, we're still projecting a mid-to-late-February peak\" of virus cases in Wuhan, Adam Kucharski, an associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology, said by email Sunday (Feb 9). \"There's a lot of uncertainty, so I'm cautious about picking out a single value for the peak, but it's possible based on current data we might see a peak prevalence over 5 per cent.\" \n That would potentially mean at least 1 in 20 people would have been infected in the city by the time the epidemic peaks, Kucharski said, adding that this may change if transmission patterns slow in coming days. The prediction doesn't indicate a coming surge in cases in Wuhan, but that the current cumulative total doesn't reflect all infections, especially mild ones, that have occurred. \n Health authorities in China and around the world are anxiously waiting to know whether the world's largest known quarantine effort has been effective in containing the pneumonia-causing virus in Wuhan and across other cities in Hubei province, a landlocked region of 60 million people. \n Kucharski, whose research focuses on the dynamics of infectious diseases, and colleagues have based their modelling on a range of assumptions about the 2019-nCoV virus. These include an incubation period of 5.2 days, a delay from the onset of symptoms to confirmation of infection of 6.1 days, and about 10 million people being at risk of infection in Wuhan. \n Based on that, a prevalence of 5 per cent equates to about 500,000 cumulative infections. That's many times more than the 16,902 cases provincial health authorities had counted in Wuhan as of midnight Sunday. \n Researchers will gauge the proportion of people in the population who have been infected with 2019-nCoV after a test becomes available that enables them to conduct a so-called serosurvey to identify those whose blood contains antibodies produced in response to exposure to the virus. \n Currently, the true number of people in Wuhan exposed to the virus \"may be vastly underestimated,\" Manuel Battegay and colleagues at the University of Basel in Switzerland said in a study published Friday. \"With a focus on thousands of serious cases, mild or asymptomatic courses that possibly account for the bulk of the 2019-nCoV infections might remain largely unrecognised, in particular during the influenza season.\" \n Authorities in China have counted more than 37,000 cases - of which more than 800 have been fatal - over the past two months. That has surpassed the 774 fatalities from the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, over eight months, according to the World Health Organisation. \n In the first 17,000 or so cases, about 82 per cent are mild, 15 per cent severe and 3 per cent critical, the WHO said Friday. Of 138 patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in the first four weeks of January, 26 per cent were placed in intensive care and 4.3 per cent died, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association published Friday found. \n While the fast-moving, infectious coronavirus has caused thousands of people to fall gravely ill and overwhelm hospitals, once researchers understand the full spectrum of illness associated with the virus, the overall case-fatality risk is likely to be much less than 1 per cent, said Ian Lipkin, director of the Centre for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York. \n People with mild or no apparent symptoms aren't currently being counted among cases, he told reporters Sunday. A slowdown in the increase in reported cases over the past few days is \"meaningful,\" according to Lipkin, who recently returned to the U.S. from China, where he was advising on the outbreak. He spoke with journalists during a 14-day home quarantine. \n If measures taken so far to contain the outbreak are effective, some \"dramatic reductions\" in infections should be observed in the third or fourth weeks of February, he said. Warmer, early-spring weather might also impede transmission, he said. \n Some studies indicate an infected person may not display symptoms for 14 days or more, with testing and confirmation of cases adding to delays. This will prolong the time it will take to identify whether China's unprecedented disease-control measures have worked. \n \"The next two weeks are really critical to understand what's been happening,\" said Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong, in an interview in Melbourne on Thursday. \"And, is this going to spread into other locations, or have we avoided what could be a global pandemic because of the control measures that have been implemented to date?\" The number of cases reported in Wuhan and across Hubei province has been tracking downward over the past several days. \n \"There has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from Hubei, and we're in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn't advanced,\" Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters in Geneva Saturday. \"That's good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place.\" There has been a \"low, but steady incidence\" of infections in places outside Hubei, Ryan said. It's unclear which of those provinces may control the disease or where it might escalate, he said. \n \"We hope that the same stabilisation that appears to be occurring in Wuhan also occurs outside,\" Ryan said. \"But, again it's very, very, very early to make any predictions about numbers.\" \"This is still a very intense disease outbreak in Wuhan and Hubei, and there are still great risks in practically all of the other provinces, so we will wait and see,\" he said. \n "}, {"content": "Ministra da Agricultura lamenta má interpretação das suas declarações sobre coronavírus.

Fears of a U.S.-Iran war gave way to the coronavirus pandemic which JPMorgan reckons will have pushed the world economy into a 12% contraction over January to March. The quarter saw the most brutal global equity collapse since the Great Depression, exacerbated by a 60% oil price slump.  \n April may not bring much relief, with coronavirus still spreading rapidly and keeping large parts of the global economy shuttered. Banks have rushed to slash Q2 forecasts too, so expect more turbulence on financial markets.  \n The cavalry has arrived though. G20 governments have promised a $5 trillion revival effort, major central banks have slashed rates and restarted asset purchases. Markets have bounced big and may actually end Q1 on a high.

Coronavirus may have ended that boom.  \n With infections surging, cities in lockdown, businesses downing shutters and most travel on ice, staff layoffs are likely to mushroom. That showed up in the number of Americans filing unemployment benefit claims which hit a record of more than 3 million. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 1 million, though some estimates were as high as 4 million.  \n Now the wait is on for Friday's non-farm payrolls figures that will offer a snapshot of the jobs picture over March. The government's unprecedented $2 trillion fiscal expansion package includes a $500 billion fund to help hard-hit industries and a comparable amount to fund direct payments of up to $3,000 apiece to U.S. families.  \n Economists expect the payroll data to show a loss of 293,000 jobs - the largest monthly drop since July 2009. A significant overshoot of that and the $2 trillion stimulus approved by Congress could suddenly start to look inadequate.  \n  \n (Graphic: Pandemic payrolls, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3945/3901/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 3/CHINA'S PYRRHIC VICTORY  \n The world's factory is re-opening, but the market is closed and the shoppers are gone.  \n China's social isolation policies appear to have contained the coronavirus at home, allowing work and travel to resume. But major economic damage may be yet to come. With infections climbing exponentially in the United States, Europe and the other markets China exports to, and with supply chains in disarray, China is getting neither the imported components it needs nor demand for its products.  \n Already Chinese factories' Jan-Feb profits have hit their lowest in a decade and upcoming manufacturing surveys will very likely reveal more pain. And just like everywhere else, job losses are mounting up, regardless of how many cheap loans are being offered to businesses.

The ECB's aggressive action gives them some breathing space but, as of now, politicians are wrangling over setting up a credit line worth some 2% of annual output from the euro area bailout fund.  \n Many European governments urge the issuance of a joint debt instrument to face a crisis which Goldman Sachs economists estimate may shrink the euro economy by 9% this year. But Germany and some others oppose that. At stake, says France's Emmanuel Macron, is the survival of the European project.

Many countries on the continent lack the financial firepower or foreign currency reserves needed to combat the coronavirus and prop up their economies, with healthcare systems already under strain.  \n The World Bank and International Monetary Fund on Wednesday urged official bilateral creditors to provide immediate debt relief to the world's poorest countries as they grapple with the human and economic consequences of the pandemic.  \n Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies pledged on Thursday to inject over $5 trillion into the global economy to limit job and income losses from the coronavirus and \"do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic\", expressing concern about Africa in particular.

About 60,000 tests have been run by public and private labs in a country of 330 million, federal officials said Tuesday.\nAs a result, US officials don't fully grasp how many Americans have been infected and where they are concentrated - crucial to containment efforts. While more than 7,000 US cases had been identified as of Wednesday, as many as 96 million people could be infected in coming months, and 480,000 could die, according to a projection prepared for the American Hospital Association by Dr James Lawler, an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Centre.\nThe delayed and chaotic testing in the United States will cost lives, potentially including those of doctors and nurses, many medical experts predict. Already more than 100 people have died overall, and fears of rampant spread have led to extraordinary restrictions on social interaction, upending the US economy, schools, hospitals and everyday life.\n\"It makes me feel like I'm living in a farce,\" said Dr Ritu Thamman, a cardiologist and clinical assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Even hospital staff who may have been exposed can't get a test, she said. \"We are a rich country but we don't have these kinds of things?\"\nThe administration of President Donald Trump was tripped up by government rules and conventions, former officials and public health experts say. Instead of drafting the private sector early on to develop tests, as South Korea did, US health officials relied, as is customary, on test kits prepared by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, some of which proved faulty.\nThen, sticking to its time-consuming vetting procedures, the US Food and Drug Administration didn't approve tests other than the CDC's until February 29, more than five weeks after discussions with outside labs had begun.\nMeanwhile, in the absence of enough kits, the CDC insisted for weeks on narrow criteria for testing, recommending it only when a person had recently been to China or other hot spots or had contact with someone known to be infected. As a result, the federal government failed to screen an untold number of Americans and missed opportunities to contain the spread, clinicians and public health experts say.\nSouth Korea took a risk, releasing briskly vetted tests, then circling back later to spot check their effectiveness. By contrast, the United States' FDA said it wanted to ensure, upfront, that the tests were accurate before they went out to millions of Americans.\n\"There are always opportunities to learn from situations like this one,\" FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, who has been on the job only three months, told Reuters. \"But one thing I will stand firm on: We cannot compromise on the quality of the tests because what would be worse than no tests at all is wildly inaccurate test results.\"\nIn a statement, CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said, \"This process has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked.\" But he said \"more and more state labs have come online, increasing our public health system's ability to detect and respond to cases.\"\nBombarded by criticism amid a re-election campaign, Trump vowed on Friday to ramp up production of test kits in partnership with private companies and to make the diagnostic tests more widely available at hospitals and in-store parking lots. This week, the FDA said more than 35 universities, hospitals and lab companies had begun running their own tests, under the agency's revised policy.\nBut it may be weeks before enough tests are on hand to fill the need.\n\"The idea of anybody getting (tested) easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that,\" Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told a House committee last week. \"That is a failing. Let's admit it.\"\nIt's a problem many Americans, accustomed to hearing they have the most advanced medical care in the world, find hard to fathom.\n\"I don't know how we messed this up so badly,\" said Ruth Blodgett, 65, whose husband of the same age couldn't get a coronavirus test on Saturday in an urgent care clinic outside Rochester, New York, even though he was coughing and the doctor ordered one for him. \"We got caught flat-footed. For America, that's unacceptable.\"\n'HURRY UP AND DEVELOP THE KITS'\nAt the pivotal January 27 meeting at the Seoul train station, South Korean government leaders told companies they were cleared for take-off.\n\"They were told that the 'emergency use authorization' would be coming, so hurry up and develop the kits,\" said Lee Hyukmin, head of the coronavirus task force at the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine, who was at the meeting.\nOne of the companies was Kogene Biotech Co Ltd, whose test kit was the only one to work initially. The government announced its approval on February 4.\n\"The government acted quickly,\" said Myoah Baek, an executive director at Kogene. The Korean CDC \"disclosed information on test methods so test kit makers were able to speed up development.\"\nLee Hyukmin of the Korean laboratory society said the government was swift - but not reckless.\nSouth Korea's rapid response to the new coronavirus resulted from scars of the past.\nIn the aftermath of the 2015 outbreak of MERS, short for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, critics slammed then-President Park Geun-hye and her administration for a slow response and a lack of transparency. Public confidence waned in Park, who was impeached in 2017 following an unrelated corruption scandal.\nThe country had 186 MERS cases, more than anywhere outside the Middle East, including 38 deaths.\n\"We can't ever forget the incident. It is engraved in our mind,\" the Korean CDC's Lee Sang-won said. \"We were hurt so much, and we felt remorseful.\"\n'A REAL FOUL UP'\nOn January 31, only days after the Seoul train station meeting, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared the novel coronavirus a public health emergency, citing a similar pronouncement from the World Health Organization.\nHHS oversees the separate operations of the FDA and CDC, key agencies involved in responding to the pandemic. The CDC was responsible for developing the initial test kits for the virus. Then, under longstanding protocols, the FDA needed to approve the test before it could be sent to state and local labs around the country. Private labs and large hospitals could develop their own tests or work off the CDC version.\nOn February 3, amid the preparations to address the emergency, the FDA hosted an all-day conference at its headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, which had been scheduled well before the outbreak. Regulators, researchers and industry representatives gathered to discuss the general process for putting diagnostic tests cleared under emergencies on the path to permanent approval by the FDA.\nThough coronavirus was now the hottest topic in global medicine, a broadcast of the meeting conveyed little sense of urgency about the epidemic sweeping the globe. It was mentioned in passing but regulators mostly stuck to their Powerpoint presentations.\nIn his remarks, Dr Timothy Stenzel, who oversees the FDA's review of diagnostic tests, spoke broadly about the agency's mission to protect public health: \"It's our goal to be first in the world wherever possible to authorize new tests.\"\nCarolyn Hiller, a program director at the Medical Device Innovation Consortium, which hosted the event alongside FDA, said there were discussions with the agency about postponing the meeting because of the coronavirus outbreak, but both sides opted to go ahead.\n\"The whole coronavirus thing blew up in real time while this was happening,\" she said.\nStenzel did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the FDA acknowledged that the coronavirus was not a \"specific topic on the agenda.\" But it said the agency already was talking to test developers and \"the conference was timely and addressed issues important\" to firms and institutions looking to produce a test.\nThe following day, February 4, the FDA greenlighted a CDC test kit for the virus.\nWeeks of chaos would follow.\nBy February 8, some states and other public labs were complaining that the CDC's test wasn't working because of a flawed component that gave inconclusive results. Three days later, the CDC told the labs that it was manufacturing a new component.\nAs of mid-February, the federal government remained stuck in first gear. The CDC was the primary supplier of tests across much of the country, and other labs couldn't immediately deploy their own without the FDA's blessing.\nHHS said it has assigned a team of outside scientists to examine what went wrong with the CDC's initial batch of tests, such as whether there was a manufacturing defect, flawed design or contamination in the agency's lab. The precise problem has not been identified.\nThe CDC didn't send out new test kits until late February. Meanwhile, public health experts say, a crucial window was closing on containing the virus, which by then was known to have infected more than 60 people.\nThe US emergency declaration issued in late January created additional hurdles that hindered a wider expansion in testing, according to former federal officials and lab professionals.\nThe declaration eased the way for drugmakers to pursue vaccines and antiviral treatments for Covid-19. But public health experts said that the same declaration made it harder to expand diagnostic testing outside the CDC.\nThat's because the declaration required diagnostic tests developed by individual labs, such as those at hospitals or universities, to undergo greater scrutiny than in non-emergencies - presumably because the stakes are higher.\n\"Paradoxically, it increased regulations on diagnostics while it created an easier pathway for vaccines and antivirals,\" said Dr Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Centre for Health Security. \"There was a real foul-up with diagnostic tests that has exposed a flaw in the United States' pandemic response plan.\"\nDr William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said the CDC and FDA stuck to their conventional playbook for too long.\n\"Traditional public health thinking is, 'Don't create widespread panic and don't go over the top. Keep the testing narrow in a precision rifle approach rather than a mass, shotgun approach,'\" Schaffner said. \"That failed in this instance. This virus acted differently and it overwhelmed the US system. South Korea had a much better sense of what was happening.\"\nIn a statement Tuesday, the CDC said: \"After finding out that some labs could not fully verify the test, CDC began working on a solution and identifying the source of the problem . CDC, in conjunction with FDA, determined how to move forward and shared this information immediately with public health labs.\"\nThe CDC statement also suggested that the agency was not exclusively responsible for testing delays.\nThe CDC was \"not an impediment\" to getting large-scale commercial testing started, according to the statement. That was the role of the FDA, and as the initial US cases were being detected in late January and early February, CDC director Dr Robert Redfield highlighted the need for that agency to act, according to the CDC statement.\nAlberto Gutierrez, who led the FDA's office overseeing diagnostic testing from 2009 to 2017, said the agency proceeded with caution because it saw itself as the last line of defense against opportunistic companies looking to cash in on threats to public health. \"There is money to be made in an emergency, and a lot of people try to take advantage of that,\" Gutierrez said. \"The problem the FDA faces is, do you let it become the Wild West?\"\n\"The FDA had good intentions,\" he said.\nRAMPING UP\nIn mid-February, cases spiked at a secretive church in the southeastern city of Daegu. On February 26, Daegu city officials said they would test every single member of the church, including those without symptoms.\nAs of March 10, Daegu said that it had tested almost all of the 10,000 members of the church in that area, and about 40% came back positive. The city, which now accounts for about three-quarters of total infections in South Korea, has seen new cases sharply drop. On Wednesday, officials announced 46 new cases compared to a peak of 741 cases on February 29.\nThe country went from two approved test makers on February 18 to five as of last week, according to the Korean CDC.\n\"To my surprise, test kit makers were able to boost production quickly,\" Korean CDC's Lee Sang-won said.\nPLEADING WITH WASHINGTON\nBy February 24, state and local labs in the United States were pleading with the FDA to relax its rules so the nation no longer had to rely so heavily on the CDC for testing. They asked Hahn, the FDA commissioner, for \"enforcement discretion\" so they could use their own lab-developed tests.\n\"We are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of CDC for the vast majority of our member laboratories,\" Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, and Grace Kubin, lab services director at the Texas Department of State Health Services, wrote to Hahn on February 24 in a letter reviewed by Reuters.\nIn an interview, Becker, whose group represents more than 100 state and local health laboratories, called the letter a \"Hail Mary\" pass, an act of desperation.\n\"The entire lab community was really coming unglued. We knew we could develop tests and were very capable of doing that, but we felt hamstrung\" Becker told Reuters.\nThat same day, the Trump administration confirmed the first death in the United States from the coronavirus, a man in his 50s in Washington state.\nOn March 2, Stenzel at the FDA's diagnostic testing office hosted a webinar for lab test developers, highlighting additional challenges, including a shortage of viral samples needed for validation of test results. Some labs also have reported shortages of other key supplies and ingredients, as well as the need for more trained personnel.\nAs US regulators rewrote their policies, South Korean municipalities were opening roadside testing facilities across the country, collecting samples in minutes while people sat in their cars.\nAt a closed-door meeting last week in Congress, US Representative Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California and an emergency-room physician who treated patients during the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, pressed the FDA commissioner and other members of the Trump administration on why South Korea was lapping the United States in its response.\n\"Why don't we have drive-through testing like South Korea?\" Ruiz asked leaders of the president's coronavirus task force.\nRuiz told Reuters the officials said they were working on it. On their own, some hospitals and communities have begun offering drive-through testing in Colorado, New York, Texas and elsewhere.\nIn recent days, as the public criticism grew louder, Trump appointed a testing czar to improve coordination across agencies. The FDA launched a 24-hour hotline for laboratories needing help to accelerate testing, approved two company applications for higher-volume testing and granted states the flexibility to authorize new tests so labs can bypass the FDA.\nDespite the new moves, Ruiz said he fears America is still weeks away from approaching what South Korea has accomplished. \"I think months have been lost here,\" Ruiz said. \"Maybe we should look into purchasing South Korea's tests.\"\nThat may happen. Both Kogene and SolGent Co, two of the Covid-19 test-makers approved in South Korea, said their companies have an eye on the US market.\n\"The FDA asked us to proceed with applications quickly,\" Kogene executive Myoah Baek said.\n(Chad Terhune reported from Los Angeles; Dan Levine and Jane Lee reported from San Francisco and Hyunjoo Jin from South Korea.

China's leadership on Wednesday touted \"positive results\" from efforts to contain the new coronavirus epidemic but warned it still faced a \"large-scale war\" against the outbreak as the death toll climbed past 1 100.\nPresident Xi Jinping chaired a meeting of the ruling Politburo Standing Committee after figures showed that the number of new cases dropped for the second straight day, fuelling hopes the epidemic could peak later this month.\nXi said there were \"positive results\" but warned that the country \"must not relax\" its epidemic control efforts, according to state media, as authorities have kept tens of millions of people under lockdown.\nChina still faces a \"large-scale war\" and a \"big test\", said state broadcaster CCTV in a readout of the gathering.\nAuthorities said Wednesday another 97 people had died in China, raising the national toll to 1,113, while more than 44 600 people had been infected by the newly named COVID-19 virus.\nThe number of people infected on a cruise ship off Japan, meanwhile, rose to 174 -- the biggest cluster outside the Chinese mainland.\nThe World Health Organisation has called the epidemic a \"very grave threat\".\nMost of the deaths and majority of cases have been in central Hubei province, whose capital, Wuhan, is the epicentre of the outbreak. Some 56 million have been placed under virtual quarantine in the province.\nThe epidemic has threatened to harm the world's second-largest economy, with ANZ bank warning that China's first-quarter GDP growth would slow to 3.2-4.0 percent, down from a previous projection of 5.0 percent.\nIt is also disrupting sporting and cultural events in China, with motorsport governing body FIA announcing the suspension of the Formula One Grand Prix in Shanghai that had been scheduled for April 19 due to the \"continued spread\" of the coronavirus.\nBut in a positive development, the number of new cases has fallen in Hubei for two straight days with some 1,600 reported, according to figures from the National Health Commission.\nOutside the province, the number of new patients has declined every day for the past week.\n\"In general, the number of new cases is now slowly decreasing,\" Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at China's National Health Commission, said in a video conference with medical staff in Wuhan on Tuesday.\n'Very grave threat'\n\"When does the turning point occur? I can't say. But I think it's at its peak in mid- to late-February,\" he said.\nAustralia's chief medical officer was more circumspect, however.\n\"I think we've just got to watch the data very closely over the coming weeks before we make any predictions,\" Brendan Murphy told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\nIn Geneva, the WHO is hosting a two-day international conference on combatting the virus during which it decided to name it COVID-19 - in keeping with guidelines aimed at avoiding linking disease to an animal or a geographic location.\nWarning it posed a \"very grave threat\" to the world, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there was a \"window of opportunity to hit hard and stand in unison to fight this virus in every corner\".\nIn addition to locking down Hubei, authorities have restricted movements in several other cities far from the epicentre in its unprecedented effort to contain the virus.\nAuthorities have found a cluster in the northern port city of Tianjin, where 39 people were infected in one department store, according to the official Xinhua news agency. The first case was a salesperson who was diagnosed on January 31.\nCruise ship infections rise\nSeveral countries have banned arrivals from China, while major airlines have halted flights to and from the country, as hundreds of people have now been infected in some two-dozen countries.\nThe biggest cluster of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan's coast.\nAn additional 39 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for COVID-19, raising the total number of cases to 174, while thousands of passengers and crew face a second week in quarantine.\nThe case of a British man who passed on the virus to at least 11 other people - without having been in China - has raised fears of a new phase of contagion abroad.\nThe 53-year-old man caught the virus while attending a conference in Singapore and then passed it on to several compatriots while on holiday in the French Alps, before finally being diagnosed back in Britain.\nGiven China's economic heft and position at the nexus of global supply chains, the virus is affecting companies far and wide and across multiple sectors across the world.\nInternational conferences are also being affected, with this week's Singapore Air Show - Asia's biggest - badly hit by exhibitors withdrawing and low attendance.\nUS chip giant Intel, Facebook, Chinese phone maker Vivo, and Cisco, meanwhile, have all withdrawn from the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona over coronavirus fears.\n"}, {"content": "Covid-19. Coreia do Sul, um modelo de combate de sucesso mas falível. O surto de Covid-19 parecia estar controlado na Coreia do Sul, mas esta semana um aumento contínuo do número de casos positivos voltou a fazer disparar os alarmes. Esta quinta-feira registaram-se 152 novos casos, ontem mais 93 e na véspera mais 84.\n“À luz do recente aumento rápido do número de casos de Covid-19 na Europa, nos Estados Unidos e na região do Médio Oriente, bem como do aumento do número de casos importados encontrados tanto em quarentenas nos aeroportos como em comunidades, o Centro de Controlo e Prevenção de Doenças da Coreia (KCDC) anunciou que o Procedimento Especial de Entrada [no país] foi alargado a todos os viajantes”, decretou esta quinta-feira a KCDC, num comunicado publicado no seu sítio na Internet.\nDesde a meia-noite desta quinta-feira quem tenta entrar na Coreia do Sul tem de responder a um questionário, medir a febre, fornecer um endereço no país e informações de contacto. Nos 14 dias seguintes, terá de reportar diariamente os seus sintomas através de uma aplicação de autodiagnóstico no telemóvel.\nAs novas medidas visaram já o voo charter com 80 sul-coreanos a bordo, que aterrou esta quinta-feira à tarde no Aeroporto Internacional de Incheon, em Seul, vindo do Irão — o terceiro país mais afetado em termos globais. Os passageiros foram transportados para uma unidade de isolamento, em Seongnam, a sul da capital sul-coreana, “onde passarão dois dias em testes ao coronavírus. Se derem negativo, será pedido a essas pessoas que se isolem voluntariamente nas suas casas”, noticiou o jornal “The Korea Herald”.\nDesde o início desta crise, a Coreia do Sul — que chegou a ter o pior surto fora da China — tem vindo a aplicar um modelo de combate assente na transparência e na cooperação dos cidadãos, em contexto de uma aparente normalidade. Seul optou por realizar testes em massa à população, abdicando de medidas de bloqueio como o encerramento de fronteiras ou o isolamento domiciliário, como têm sido adotadas na maioria dos países.\nHoje a Coreia do Sul tem uma das mais baixas taxas de mortalidade por Covid-19: apenas 1,06%.\n“Fizemos o nosso melhor para armazenarmos recursos e trabalhamos com esforço para fazer testes em massa a pessoas e realizar quarentenas”, diz o epidemiologista Hwang Seung-sik, professor na Universidade Nacional de Seul, citado pela televisão árabe Al-Jazeera. “Mas o coronavírus anda por aí há três meses e não é muito claro quais os preparativos que fizeram os Estados Unidos e os países europeus.”\nTal como na Coreia do Sul, atualmente a maior preocupação na China prende-se com o regresso a casa de chineses que vivem no estrangeiro. Esta quinta-feira, Pequim anunciou, pela primeira vez desde dezembro, zero casos de contágio interno. Em compensação, foram detetados 34 casos importados do estrangeiro.\nNo presente contexto, os chineses que vivem no exterior sentem-se mais protegidos pelas medidas de vigilância e controlo impostas pelo seu Governo do que pela resposta dos sobrecarregados serviços de saúde ocidentais.\n"}, {"content": "Trump declares national emergency to combat coronavirus.

Somos a porta de entrada para as nações do Pacífico e isso também foi considerado na nossa decisão”, sublinhou Ardern sobre a medida, adotada também por outros países, como a Austrália e os EUA.\nApesar da proibição, o diário “The New Zeland Herald” noticiou que os voos procedentes da China continuam a aterrar, embora as autoridades fronteiriças neozelandesas apenas permitam o desembarque de cidadãos do país. Depois do desembarque, estas pessoas são sujeitas a exames médicos.\nNotícia atualizada às 8h35\n"}, {"content": "Novo vírus da pneumonia que está a afectar a China já chegou aos EUA. O novo coronavírus responsável por um surto de pneumonia na China chegou aos Estados Unidos, confirmaram esta terça-feira os Centros de Controlo e Prevenção de Doenças (CDC, na sigla em inglês). O doente tinha regressado há poucos dias de Wuhan, o epicentro do surto, e com este caso são já cinco os países que registam doentes infectados além da China – Japão, Tailândia, Coreia do Sul, Taiwan e agora os Estados Unidos.\nAs autoridades de saúde norte-americanas identificaram um homem, com cerca de 30 anos e residente no estado de Washington, infectado pelo coronavírus, após ter regressado de uma viagem até Wuhan. “O doente procurou assistência numa instituição médica no estado de Washington, onde foi tratado. Dado o registo de viagem e sintomas, os profissionais de saúde suspeitaram do novo coronavírus. Uma amostra clínica foi recolhida e enviada para os CDC, onde testes laboratoriais confirmaram, esta segunda-feira, o diagnóstico”, informa a instituição em comunicado. \nO homem entrou no país a 15 de Janeiro, antes de as autoridades norte-americanas terem instalado pontos de rastreio nos aeroportos de Nova Iorque, São Francisco e Los Angeles. À chegada a solo norte-americano, os passageiros de voos provenientes desta região chinesa são agora avaliados pelas equipas de saúde, numa tentativa de detectar atempadamente possíveis casos de infecção do coronavírus. Estas medidas de segurança nos aeroportos foram imitadas por vários outros países. \nNo total, foram registados 216 casos de infecção com o coronavírus, sendo que 51 pessoas encontram-se em estado grave e 12 em estado crítico. O número de mortes subiu esta terça-feira, depois de se confirmar a morte de mais três pessoas infectadas. São já seis pessoas que morreram na sequência deste surto.\nO Presidente chinês, Xi Jinping, afirmou na segunda-feira que a prioridade das autoridades chinesas é conter o surto e salvar vidas, numa altura em que milhões de chineses viajam pelo país para as festividades do Ano Novo chinês, que começam esta semana. “A vida e saúde das pessoas devem ser a grande prioridade e a disseminação do surto tem de ser controlada”, afirmou Xi Jinping em declarações​ à televisão estatal. \nDe acordo com os números apresentados pela comissão nacional de saúde e citados pela BBC, mais de 300 pessoas estão infectadas com o novo vírus um pouco por toda a China, mas estudos científicos apontam para que o vírus tenha atingido 20 cidades só nos primeiros 17 dias do ano. A equipa de Neil Ferguson, do Centro de Análise Global de Doenças Infecciosas do Imperial College de Londres, acredita que o número de pessoas infectadas supere em muito o valor reconhecido pelas autoridades locais. Estes investigadores britânicos estimam que mais de 1700 pessoas tenham sido infectadas por este vírus. \nA Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) está a considerar uma declaração de emergência de saúde pública internacional – como aconteceu com a gripe suína e com o vírus do ébola –, mas a decisão só vai ser tomada nesta quarta-feira. A maior parte dos casos parece estar relacionada com um mercado de marisco da cidade de Wuhan, mas as autoridades chinesas já admitiram que alguns dos infectados pelo coronavírus “não tinham um historial de contacto” com este local de comércio que se acredita estar no centro do surto”. O caso identificado nos Estados Unidos, por exemplo, é um dos que aparenta não ter ligação com o mercado: a CNN diz que o homem garantiu não ter visitado este ponto da cidade. \nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\nSoube-se, esta segunda-feira, que a doença é transmissível entre humanos, o que aumenta o potencial de transmissão. Noutro comunicado, a comissão de saúde de Wuhan, cidade onde se pensa que este surto possa ter começado, informou que 15 funcionários das equipas médicas que mais contacto tiveram com estes doentes estão infectados com o mesmo coronavírus. Um deles está em condição crítica, informa a BBC.\nEm Taiwan, foi também confirmado esta terça-feira o primeiro caso de uma infecção do género. Trata-se de uma mulher de 50 anos que tinha regressado de Wuhan esta segunda-feira. O Centro de Controlo de Doenças de Taiwan relatou à agência Reuters que a mulher foi encaminhada directamente do aeroporto para o hospital com sinais de febre e tosse.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavírus.

Percebeu-se que todas as pessoas trabalhavam ou visitavam com frequência o mercado de marisco e carnes de Huanan, nessa mesma cidade. Ainda se desconhece a origem exata da infeção, mas terão sido animais infetados, que são comercializados vivos, a transmiti-la aos seres humanos.\nOs sintomas destes coronavírus são mais intensos do que uma gripe e incluem febre, dor, mal-estar geral e dificuldades respiratórias, incluindo falta de ar.\nA OMS decidiu na quarta-feira prolongar até hoje a reunião do Comité de Emergência para decidir se declara emergência de saúde pública internacional o surto de um novo coronavírus na China.\n"}, {"content": "Origen, síntomas, letalidad... Lo que se sabe del nuevo virus de China. El nuevo coronavirus 2019-nCoV surgido en la ciudad china de Wuhan ha provocado una de las mayores crisis sanitarias de los últimos años. Lo que sigue son las certezas e interrogantes abiertos sobre el episodio.\n¿Cómo empezó el brote?\nLas autoridades chinas notificaron el pasado 31 de diciembre 27 casos de neumonía de origen desconocido, siete de ellos graves. Los afectados estaban aparentemente vinculados con un mercado de la ciudad de Wuhan, una gran metrópoli con 11 millones de habitantes. La causa de la dolencia fue identificada el 7 de enero como un nuevo coronavirus. China comunicó días más tarde que el patógeno podía transmitirse de persona a persona.\n¿Qué síntomas causa el virus?\nEl virus infecta las vías respiratorias y causa síntomas que van desde un cuadro leve (tos seca, fiebre...) a insuficiencia respiratoria aguda y neumonías potencialmente mortales.\n¿Cómo se contagia?\nNo han sido determinados con precisión los mecanismos, aunque la forma más aceptada es a través del contacto y a través pequeñas gotas de saliva que el portador del virus excreta al toser. El contagio se produce entre personas que están cerca, a una distancia de aproximadamente un metro como máximo.\n¿Hay casos asintomáticos?\nAún no se conoce con exactitud, aunque los expertos consideran que es probable, como ha ocurrido con otros virus similares.\n¿Existe tratamiento?\nNo existe tratamiento específico ni vacuna, aunque hay varios proyectos en marcha para conseguirla. La asistencia médica se centra en los síntomas y en dar soporte vital al enfermo. Antivirales como el oseltamivir, baloxavir, ribavirin y acyclovir no son efectivos frente al virus. China estudia el uso combinado de lopinavir and ritonavir.\n¿Cómo se diagnostica?\nChina hizo pública la la secuencia genética del virus el 10 de enero, tres días después de su identificación. Esto permitió crear un protocolo de diagnóstico específico con el que cuentan todos los países miembros. Sin los análisis, es prácticamente imposible distinguirlo de otro tipo de neumonía, o incluso de una gripe. Los grandes hospitales cuentan una tecnología, llamada PCR, que permite confirmar la infección por el virus en unas horas, aunque en España las confirmaciones oficiales dependen del Centro Nacional de Microbiología.\n¿Cuál es la evolución de la enfermedad?\nEl número de afectados no ha dejado de crecer desde el pasado 31 de diciembre y la tendencia sigue siendo al alza tanto en China como en otros países.\n¿Ha sido rápida la expansión del virus?\nLos expertos destacan que la gran velocidad de propagación del virus. Los casos registrados en China en menos de un mes —el 29 de enero se han superado los 6.000— superan a los 5.300 diagnosticados con el SARS.\n¿Qué es un coronavirus?\nSon una extensa familia virus que afectan al ser humano y varias especies de animales. Hasta ahora había seis conocidos que podían enfermar a una persona: cuatro que causan el resfriado común, el del SARS (surgido en 2002 también en China) y el del MERS (en 2012 en Arabia Saudí). Coronavirus que solo afectan a algunas especies pueden sufrir mutaciones que les permiten saltar a otras y volverse virulentos para el ser humano. El síndrome respiratorio agudo severo (SARS, en sus siglas en inglés) causó más de 800 muertes y el síndrome respiratorio de Oriente Medio (MERS) ha ocasionado 2.500 casos confirmados y 850 muertes. Las investigaciones realizadas hasta el momento apuntan que el origen de ambos está en los murciélagos y esta es la principal hipótesis también en el de Wuhan.\n¿Qué letalidad tiene el nuevo virus de Wuhan?\nLos expertos apuntan que la tasa de mortalidad del nuevo patógeno es baja, entre el 2% y el  3%, en comparación con virus similares, según los primeros datos disponibles. Al virus del SRAS se le atribuye una mortalidad de entre el 10% y el 18%, y el del MERS alcanza al 35% de los enfermos notificados, según la OMS.\n¿Podría el virus mutar y hacerse más virulento?\nAunque todo virus es susceptible de sufrir una mutación, desde que se localizó ha permanecido bastante estable, según señala la OMS, que advierte que es un escenario que no se puede descartar.\n¿Qué medidas se han adoptado?\nChina ha decidido someter a cuarentena a la ciudad de Wuhan, de la que no es posible salir ni entrar desde la pasada madrugada, y más de una docena de localidades cercanas. En ellas se ha generalizado el uso de mascarillas. En total, ha confinado a más de 46 millones de personas. Aeropuertos de la gran mayoría de los países asiáticos, así como Estados Unidos, Reino Unido y Rusia, entre otros, han establecido medidas de control para detectar viajeros con síntomas compatibles procedentes de las zonas afectadas. El aeropuerto de Wuhan permanece prácticamente cerrado. \n¿Que está haciendo la OMS?\nLa organización ha monitorizado la evolución del brote prácticamente desde el primer día, ya que ha situado los coronavirus entre las amenazas para causar una futura pandemia global. El comité de emergencia se ha reunido dos veces y, aunque muy dividido, no ha decidido por ahora declarar emergencia internacional, aunque en la última semana de enero ha cambiado de \"moderada\" a \"alta\" la calificación de amenaza global que supone el virus. \n¿Qué implica la declaración de emergencia internacional?\nLa declaración de una emergencia de salud pública de importancia internacional se adopta ante un brote una situación \"grave, repentina, inusual e inesperada\" con consecuencias sanitarias cuyo impacto se extiende más allá del país afectado. Con la declaración se inicia el proceso que haga posible una acción internacional inmediata y coordinada. La OMS ha adoptado esta decisión cinco veces: por la gripe A en 2009, contra la polio en 2014, contra el ébola en África Occidental en 2014, contra el zika en 2016 y el pasado mes de julio contra el ébola en la República Democrática del Congo.\n¿Hay riesgo para España?\nEl Ministerio de Sanidad considera que \"teniendo en cuenta los controles realizados por las autoridades chinas, el riesgo de introducción del virus en España en estos momentos se considera muy bajo\".  En todo caso, incluso si el virus llegara, \"el impacto para la salud pública\" también sería \"muy bajo\".\n¿Cómo se llamará el nuevo coronavirus?\nDe momento, tiene uno provisional 2019-nCoV (nuevo virus de 2019), pero la OMS decidirá uno definitivo. Normalmente, se bautizan con el nombre del lugar donde fueron descubiertos, así que probablemente será el virus de Wuhan.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavírus faz disparar vendas de livros \"A peste\" e \"Ensaio sobre a cegueira\" em Itália. A epidemia de Covid-19, causada por um novo coronavírus, fez disparar as vendas 'online' dos romances \"A peste\", de Albert Camus, e \"Ensaio sobre a cegueira\", de José Saramago, em Itália, o país europeu mais afetado.\nEm tempos de medo do novo coronavírus detetado em dezembro, na China, vários eventos e equipamentos culturais foram já cancelados, para evitar a propagação, mas, em contrapartida, a procura por livros, filmes, séries ou jogos que abordem o tema das pandemias, tem vindo a aumentar desde o início do ano.\n\nOs últimos indicadores dão conta de um aumento das vendas de livros como \"A Peste\" (1947), da autoria do escritor franco-argelino Albert Camus, Prémio Nobel da Literatura e cujo 60.º aniversário da morte se assinala este ano, que fala de uma epidemia de peste, nos anos 1940, que rapidamente toma conta de toda a cidade de Orão, na Argélia.\nSujeita a quarentena, esta cidade torna-se um território irrespirável e os seus habitantes são conduzidos até estados de sofrimento, de loucura, mas também de compaixão.\nNo mês passado, em Itália -- o país europeu mais afetado, com 3.089 casos de infeção confirmados -, mais de 50 mil pessoas ficaram de quarentena devido ao surto de Covid-19.\nNeste país, o livro de Camus subiu para o terceiro lugar do top de vendas do portal ibs, quando há um mês estava em 71.º lugar, noticia o jornal italiano \"La Repubblica\", adiantado que também a plataforma Amazon registou esta semana uma subida do livro no 'ranking' da categoria de clássicos, tendo triplicado as vendas.\nEm França, algo semelhante se verificou, com 8.889 cópias de \"A peste\" a serem vendidas nos dois primeiros meses do ano, quando em todo o ano passado o total de vendas situou-se nos 22.400, segundo o portal de estatísticas de vendas de livros da Edistat.\nTambém o \"Ensaio sobre a cegueira\" (1995), de José Saramago, escritor que ganhou o Nobel da Literatura três anos depois, se tornou um fenómeno literário em Itália, tendo chegado ao top-10 do ibs e ao 5.º lugar da Amazon, com um aumento de 180% nas vendas.\nA história fala de uma epidemia de cegueira branca, que começa com um homem a cegar inexplicavelmente, quando se encontra dentro do carro no meio do trânsito, e que se alastra como um rastilho de pólvora, até à cegueira coletiva.\nUma situação parecida com a procura destes livros está a acontecer com filmes como \"Contágio\" (2011), de Steven Soderbergh, em que uma mulher regressada de uma viagem de negócios a Hong Kong morre de uma suposta gripe, mas o vírus espalha-se e a epidemia mortal alastra-se, com os médicos a correr contra o tempo para tentar identificar o vírus e combatê-lo e acabar com o pânico da população.\n\"Contágio\" já está entre os dez filmes mais vistos no iTunes e entre os quinze mais descarregados, de acordo com o 'Google Trends'.\nO documentário da Netflix \"Pandemia\", que apresenta os heróis de uma batalha contra a gripe e o seu trabalho para impedir um surto em todo o mundo, que não é causado pelo coronavírus, mas mostra que o sistema mundial de saúde não está preparado para enfrentar uma crise global de saúde, também se tornou um assunto central no Twitter.\nE como o medo vende, já correm nas redes sociais várias previsões, uma delas relatada no romance \"The Eyes of Darkness\", do escritor norte-americano de ficção científica Dean Koontz.\nPublicado em 1981, com uma reimpressão em 1989, o livro tem um capítulo que fala de uma doença chamada Wuhan-400, que é na verdade uma arma biológica criada naquela cidade chinesa.\nA página que descreve as consequências do vírus tornou-se ela mesma viral, sobretudo no Twitter: \"Chamam-lhe Wuhan-400 porque foi criado num dos laboratórios de pesquisa de RDNA às portas da cidade de Wuhan, e foi a estirpe n.º400 de micro-organismos fabricados pelo homem criados nesse centro. Wuhan é a arma perfeita. Só afeta seres humanos. Mais nenhum ser vivo pode ser portador\".\nViral também se tornou uma imagem da banda desenhada \"Astérix em Itália\", publicado em 2017, onde um cocheiro chamado Coronavirus participa de uma corrida de carruagem, embora não tenha nada a ver com nenhuma doença, sendo apenas uma curiosidade de nome e país.\nNestes dias de busca por presságios catastróficos, também um aviso de Bill Gates, feito em fevereiro de 2017, foi posto a circular. Na altura, o cofundador da Microsoft disse que um agente patogénico que se espalha pelo ar e se move rapidamente \"poderia matar mais de 30 milhões pessoas em menos de um ano\", embora já anteriormente, em 2015, tivesse alertado, durante uma palestra, que o mundo não estava preparado \"para uma próxima epidemia\".\nMais catastrófica é a descrição que a escritora Sylvia Browne faz no seu livro de 2008 \"End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About the End of the World\", e que também se espalhou pelas redes sociais, segundo a qual uma doença respiratória rebentaria por todo o planeta no ano 2020, e não desapareceria até passarem dez anos.\nO surto de Covid-19, detetado em dezembro, na China, e que pode causar infeções respiratórias como pneumonia, provocou cerca de 3.300 mortos e infetou mais de 95 mil pessoas em 79 países, incluindo oito em Portugal.\nDas pessoas infetadas, mais de 50 mil recuperaram.\nAlém de 3.012 mortos na China, há registo de vítimas mortais no Irão, Itália, Coreia do Sul, Japão, França, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Austrália, Tailândia, Estados Unidos da América e Filipinas, San Marino, Iraque, Suíça e Espanha.\nUm português tripulante de um navio de cruzeiros está hospitalizado no Japão com confirmação de infeção.\nEm Portugal, a Direção-Geral da Saúde (DGS) confirmou oito casos de infeção, dos quais seis no Porto, um em Coimbra e um em Lisboa.\nA Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS) declarou o surto de Covid-19 como uma emergência de saúde pública internacional e aumentou o risco para \"muito elevado\"."}, {"content": "What we don’t yet know about the coronavirus. (Reuters) - It has been only three months since reports first emerged from China of an unknown virus causing unusual cases of pneumonia, and scientists and public health experts already know more about it and how it works than at the same point in earlier outbreaks.\nBut there’s still a lot they don’t know.\nAs the new coronavirus continues to spread around the world, here are some of the most important questions researchers and doctors – as well as policymakers and economists – are still trying to answer:\nHow contagious is the virus?\nThe virus spreads from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth via coughing or sneezing, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It can persist on most surfaces up to several days, so in addition to directly inhaling the virus, you can become infected by touching something that has been contaminated and then touching your own nose, mouth or eyes. There is some evidence that virus particles in the feces of an infected person can transmit the disease through contact, but that remains unconfirmed.\nHow many people are infected, and how many do not show any symptoms?\nSo far, more than 550,000 cases have been reported worldwide, of which more than 127,000 have recovered and more than 24,000 have died. Some researchers estimate that up to 80% of people who are infected show no or only mild symptoms and may not even know they are sick. That would put the number of people who might have been infected in the millions. But we need many more studies and much more testing to close in on a more accurate number.\nGraphic: Tracking the spread of the coronavirus, here\nAre younger people less likely to die from the virus?\nYounger people, while less vulnerable, can still develop COVID-19 - the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus -  severe enough to require hospitalization. Just how much safer they are is still unanswered. The WHO says older people with pre-existing conditions - such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease - appear to develop serious illness more often than others, while a U.S. health official said the mortality rate in males appears to be twice that of women in every age group. Health officials have cautioned that anyone with those underlying conditions, as well as those with weakened immune systems, are at increased risk.\nCan people be re-infected?\nThis is a key question – and we don’t yet know the answer. There are a handful of cases of possible “reinfection” in recovered patients. But most scientists believe those are more likely to have been relapses. A patient may feel better and test negative for the virus in their nose and throat, while the virus remains elsewhere in their body. Fully recovered patients have antibodies in their blood that should protect them from fresh infection, but we don’t know how long those antibodies will last. With some viruses, antibodies fade faster. Even if they do persist, SARS-CoV-2 might undergo small changes over time, as flu viruses do each year, rendering the antibodies ineffective.\nSeveral academic laboratories and medical companies are looking to produce blood tests to figure out who has been exposed to the virus and whether some people have developed immunity. Serological testing will also give a better picture of the full extent of the pandemic.\nDo we know when there will be treatments or a vaccine?\nNo. So far there are no vaccines or antiviral medicines specific to the new coronavirus. Treatment for now focuses on relieving symptoms such as breathing assistance. Companies around the world are racing to develop vaccines. A few have launched early safety testing in humans, but experts say it could take a year or more to develop and test a vaccine. Another complication: viruses can mutate quickly. Some scientists have already identified subtle changes since SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China, in December. But recent studies show the virus is relatively stable, which suggests vaccines should still be effective when they become available.\nDoes the virus spread more slowly in hot places?\nSome experts had hoped that the onset of summer will naturally slow the virus. But the European Centre for Disease Control said on Wednesday that it is unlikely to diminish its spread. The WHO has also said that the virus can be transmitted in all areas, including hot and humid climates.\nHow long will the pandemic last?\nWe don’t know. It will depend on a range of factors, from how long people continue to isolate and avoid group gatherings to when effective drugs or a vaccine become available. President Donald Trump said this week that he hopes to “reopen” the U.S. economy by Easter Sunday on April 12. But he has faced criticism that such a timetable is too rushed and could lead to more people dying. In Hubei province, the epicenter of China’s coronavirus outbreak, life has started to return to normal after two months of lockdown. It remains to be seen whether such a return to normal spurs another outbreak.\nDoes the amount of exposure to the virus determine how sick someone gets?\nViruses enter the body and infect cells, using them as factories to make many millions of copies of themselves, so the number of virus particles that first enter the body has little effect on the eventual amount of virus in the system. At the same time, more frequent exposure does increase the chance that the virus will enter the body in the first place.\nWhen will the economy return to normal?\nThe International Monetary Fund expects the pandemic will cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the 2008 financial crisis. The depth of a recession, how long it will last and the nature of the recovery are a matter of debate. Economists say it will largely depend on how long the lockdowns last – around a quarter of all humanity is currently in lockdown – and how far government support goes in helping individuals, businesses and markets survive the crisis.\nAre the trillions of dollars in emergency spending helping?\nCentral bank measures have sought to keep financial markets functioning, including areas that keep the real economy humming, such as the markets where companies go to raise short term cash to pay staff and where cities go to raise money for roads and schools. Steps taken by governments, such as the $2 trillion U.S. stimulus package, are expected to further help the economy by putting cash in the hands of individuals and providing additional funding to small businesses and companies. Such measures still need to work through the system, however, and it remains unclear whether they will be enough.\nIs it a good time to invest?\nSome investors and bank strategists are starting to look at whether people should buy back into the world’s stock markets, which have plunged some 25% from their highs in February. U.S. hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said this week he had turned increasingly positive on stocks and credit and was “redeploying our capital in companies we love at bargain prices that are built to withstand this crisis.” But with all the uncertainties, many more analysts and investors remain shy about calling the bottom of the market.\nGraphic: COVID-19 in the United States, here\n"}, {"content": "Weak economic data, coronavirus spook investors. \nThere seems to be little respite in sight for the markets - which have just seen their worst week in a decade - as the impact of coronavirus has started reflecting in economic data.\nFactory activity in China, the global engine of growth, has contracted at the fastest pace on record with China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) falling to a fresh low of 35.7 in February against 50 in January.\nFurther, China and South Korea continued to report more coronavirus cases over the weekend, while  the US, Australia, and Thailand reported their first cases of death.\n“It’s going to be a tough period,” said Shankar Sharma, founder and vice-chairman of First Global.\n“Coronavirus is a serious problem and can lop off quite a bit from global growth.”\nThe Sensex and Nifty crashed nearly 4 per cent on Friday - the biggest single-day fall since 2015 - to end at 38,297 and 11,202, respectively.\nBoth indices are down nearly 9 per cent from their all-time highs in mid-January.\nOn previous occasions, indices have rebounded sharply after a near-10 per cent drop.\nHowever, a sharp reversal seems difficult this time as the peak impact of the virus is yet to play out.\nThe India VIX surged 31 per cent on Friday, a sign that traders expect the markets - which are back to October levels - to remain highly volatile.\nFurther, most global indices have entered “correction zone”, posting a 10 per cent decline from recent highs.\nMany don’t rule out a “bear market” - a fall of 20 per cent from highs - if the World Health Organization’s (WHO) warning of a global pandemic comes true.\nThe US markets fell 4 per cent in intra-day trade on Friday, before paring losses to end 1.4 per cent lower.\nIn addition, the US 10-year Treasury hit a record low of 1.114 per cent, before settling at 1.163 per cent.\nMarket players say such low reading on the 10-year Treasury is a sign of extreme anxiety.\nForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) pulled out close to Rs 12,000 crore last week.\nDomestic investors pumped in an even higher amount, but it did little to stem the fall in share prices.\nSharma said overseas investors typically “chase momentum” and there isn’t much predictability to their flows.\nAs regards a recovery, market players have not ruled out a bounce-back on account of technical factors such as short-covering.\n“Historically, global events that have caused a meltdown in markets have proved lucrative investment opportunities.\n\"The key point to remember is that we do not know for how long the current crisis may play out.\n\"Therefore, while investing in such times, it is better to make staggered investments,” said S Naren, executive director and chief investment officer of ICICI Prudential AMC\n"}, {"content": "RPT-China's online censors tighten grip after brief coronavirus respite. (Repeats Feb 11 story with no changes in text)\nBEIJING, Feb 11 (Reuters) - China’s coronavirus outbreak has tested the limits of free speech on the country’s heavily censored online and social media, with a brief window of liberalization that opened during January subsequently slammed shut by authorities.\nWhile censorship in China has tightened under President Xi Jinping, questions of transparency around the current outbreak are especially sensitive after Beijing’s cover-up of the extent of the 2003 SARS epidemic fuelled suspicion and mistrust, and led to official calls for openness this time around.\nThe period from Jan 19 to Feb 1, when public concern about the coronavirus exploded just as China was gearing up for the Lunar New Year holiday, saw an uncharacteristic loosening. Online buzz about the outbreak flourished, with netizens largely unfettered in criticizing local authorities - but not central government leaders - over their handling of the crisis.\nThat liberalisation has come to end, with censors in the past week shutting down WeChat groups and scrubbing social media posts, according to Chinese reporters.

It’s highly likely their brief is to paint a rosier picture of the government’s relief efforts rather than engage in any muckraking or critical reporting.”\nThe cyberspace regulator, Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), did not respond to phone calls or to requests for comment sent by fax.\nChina’s censorship machine was tested last week when Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who had been reprimanded for issuing an early warning about coronavirus, died of the disease, triggering widespread outrage as well as mourning.\nOnline media outlets were permitted to report on Li’s death, but not the anger it had engendered, and early discussions on social media calling for the Wuhan government to apologise to him later disappeared.\nA notice sent to editors working for an online Chinese news outlet and seen by Reuters asked them not to “comment or speculate” on Li’s death, “do not hashtag and let the topic gradually die out from the hot search list, and guard against harmful information.”\nSarah Cook, the China media bulletin director at Freedom House, said that previous crises had also seen brief windows of openness, such as the deadly 2011 crash of a high-speed train and the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake, when domestic journalists and social media users felt emboldened.\n“At the same time, initially, officials might be a bit flat-footed and distracted dealing with an unexpected crisis so things slip through the cracks. Even censors within some social media companies may be sympathetic to some of the content and let it through,” she said.\nThe brief window of media freedom came after officials in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, admitted that it was much worse than anticipated and were heavily criticised for their move in January to reprimand eight people for “spreading rumours” on the emergence of the virus - one of whom was Li.\nLast week, however, CAC announced that it had punished some websites, mobile applications and social media accounts for publishing illicit content on the outbreak, saying it wanted to foster a “good online atmosphere” amid the country’s efforts to contain the epidemic.\nA notice circulated by CAC last week that was seen by Reuters asked audio and video platforms to step up control on “harmful information and rumour” related to Wuhan virus.\nIt also asked them to stick to official media such as Xinhua and People’s Daily, “not to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official livestreaming on the virus.”\nSome investigative articles published by local media outlets from Wuhan have also been deleted.\nChen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who was sending dispatches from Wuhan over Twitter - which is blocked in China - including images of corpses in the city’s hospitals, has been forcibly put under quarantine since Friday, according to his family and a friend managing his account in his absence.\nMany Chinese Internet users have turned to black humour or shared images, songs and other art forms in private WeChat groups to express their dismay. One phrase widely shared mocked how many Internet pages and content were now showing “server not found” or “404”.\n“404+404+404+404+404=2020,” said the shared post.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s local governments are ramping up surveillance efforts with new data collection campaigns to better trace residents’ moves in public areas, seeking to curb the coronavirus outbreak but heightening privacy concerns.\nAt least 15 provinces and cities with a combined population of over 358 million have announced such “big data” measures this month, adding to a host of monitoring tools already being used, such as facial recognition and phone data tracking.\nVisitors to office buildings, shopping malls, residential compounds and metro systems are now being asked to scan QR codes using their mobile phones and fill in forms asking for information such as their travel history and body temperature, according to residents and local media reports.\nSome regions are also instructing residents to use newly launched features by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd’s WeChat apps. Users fill in a questionnaire to obtain a obtain colour-based QR code which then acts as guidance at checkpoints as to whether the person should be quarantined or let through.\nThe outbreak, traced to the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan, has killed 2,715 so far and stricken about 78,000 in mainland China.\nAuthorities say the tools allows them to more accurately and quickly find infected people especially as millions of people  resume work after an extended holiday.\nBut the additional measures are fuelling debate over privacy and the extent and uses of the data repository China is building on its citizens. Western diplomats and activists have criticised China’s use of mass surveillance in the past.\n“Of course governments have the responsibility to protect public health and safety but these measures have to balance other rights as well, including privacy rights,” said Maya Wang, China senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n“Some of these criteria are very broad, and when you use this criteria and feed it into the app, how accurate are they?”\nSome government officials acknowledge privacy concerns and have offered reassurances.\nLiu Yuewen, who heads Yunnan province’s department of public security’s big data expert group, said individuals’ privacy would be protected, and the data would be destroyed when efforts to control the epidemic end.\n“No one will be able to see any data without the permission of the epidemic prevention and control headquarters,” he said, according to a report by the state-backed Beijing News.\nSome accounts have shed light on how the information is being used by authorities.\nOne video shared online showed residential committee officials telling residents in one apartment they needed to head to a Beijing hotel to be quarantined for 14 days.\n“Big data has shown you to be a close contact of an infected person,” said the officials in the video, which Reuters was unable to verify. An employee at the hotel named in the video told Reuters it was not currently open to the public.\nOther people who say they have been quarantined using big data have questioned its accuracy.\nA Hangzhou resident who only wanted to be identified by his surname Hu told Reuters police came to his house and said he was detected as being in contact with someone infected by the coronavirus.\nBut Hu said he had not met face-to-face with the infected person, who was a friend, and they last spoke in November through a messaging app. Hu is now in quarantine at his home.\n“My residential committee and the police station understand the situation but can not help me,” he said.\nIt was unclear whether all the data collected goes to a central depository or was analysed on a national level, as local authorities often used their own systems made by different companies.\nThe Binhai New Area in the coastal city of Tianjin, for instance, uses a platform made by Tianjin Teda Smart City Technology Co. Some of those used in the southern province of Guangxi are made by China-ASEAN Information Harbor, which describes itself on its website as a state-backed technology platform created to aid China’s “Belt and Road” initiative.\nAlipay created its coloured QR code feature with the Hangzhou government, while the health tracking feature in Tencent’s WeChat was launched in collaboration with a division of China’s National Development and Reform Council (NDRC).\nAlipay deferred questions to various government departments  who provide and operate the services, saying it does not have access to the related data.\nTencent said none of its efforts to fight the virus involved the real-time tracking of people or virus movements.\nThird-party developers, such as those who offer health code services via WeChat Mini Programs, are required to adhere to the platform’s data security requirements and anonymised user data was only accessible by the mini program’s developer, Tencent said.\nFor now, people say they are trying to get used to the new normal. He Wanlong, who lives in the Guangxi provincial capital of Nanning, estimates he is asked to submit his data on average six times a day now.\nHe told Reuters it was an unwarranted hassle given his city of about 7 million people had just 55 coronavirus cases.\n“I have better odds in winning a lottery than running into a confirmed case.”\n"}, {"content": "Novas estimativas de crescimento para 2020 divulgadas até 15 de abril.

WASHINGTON (AFP) - Thousands of people have died, the United States response has infuriated European allies, and China has gone on a propaganda offensive. The new coronavirus is shaping up to be a cataclysmic event with far-reaching consequences in global politics. \n The Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 130,000 people globally, strikes a world already in flux with the rise of nationalists such as US President Donald Trump who have scoffed at the rules of the \"globalist\" order. \n \"When the dust settles on the Covid-19 world, we won't be in the same place that we were just a week ago,\" said Mr Jon Alterman, a senior vice-president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \n \"We know that governments will shake as citizens judge them to have fumbled in their response. We know that economies will be disrupted and some economies are likely to collapse,\" he said. \n Mr Trump, who initially dismissed the risks of Covid-19, late on Wednesday (March 11) abruptly imposed a 30-day ban on most travel from mainland Europe and vowed to confront the \"foreign virus\". Leaders from the European Union voiced outrage at the move, which triggered chaos at airports, and said that they had not been consulted - which Mr Trump acknowledged. \n Ms Kelly Magsamen, the vice-president for national security and international policy at the left-leaning Centre for American Progress, said Mr Trump's move would only increase questions about Washington's historic leadership role. \n \"I think a lot of partners and allies are saying, can the US be relied upon to lead on major global challenges - whether it's a pandemic or whether it's climate change or nonproliferation?\" she said. \n \"It's going to have effects on other dimensions of our relationship.\" \n Covid-19 first emerged late last year in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan - likely at a market that sold exotic animals for their meat - and Beijing initially tried to suppress the news including by detaining the doctor who sounded the alarm. \n But China in the past week has sought to turn its Covid-19 response into a sort of soft power, with President Xi Jinping visiting Wuhan to trumpet success at containing the spread. \n China has sent medical equipment to Italy, the second-worst hit country, and Spain, highlighting its authoritarian model as decisive. \n It has also used the crisis as leverage against the United States, which has been seeking to combat Beijing's influence in all areas. \n An article in the state-run Global Times unsubtly hinted that China could stop exports of face masks and other medical gear if the Trump administration keeps pressing to restrict its tech giant Huawei. \n China as well as Russia has also promoted unfounded conspiracy theories to discredit the US. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested on Twitter that the US military may have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan. \n The Trump administration, which has offered US$100 million (S$141 million) in aid worldwide to help other countries deal with the pandemic, has in turn sought to associate China firmly with Covid-19. \n Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks of the illness as the \"Wuhan virus\" and Republican Senator Tom Cotton has vowed that the US will \"hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world.\" \n Mr Michael Green, who was the top Asia adviser to former president George W. Bush, doubted that China would ultimately find many buyers for its \"arguments about the failures of democracy\". \n But he added: \"That does not mean that the US will win this information battle.\" \n \"While the Japanese and others in Asia are not getting the shock treatment that the Europeans got overnight, there is a very strong sense of questioning American leadership right now,\" said Mr Green, now a senior vice-president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \n In one example, Mr Green pointed to the stalemate in talks over South Korea's contributions to US bases, with Mr Trump irritating the ally by insisting on much higher payments. \n One broader effect, Mr Green said, may be a shifting political narrative. \n Mr Xi, once seen as untouchable in China, has faced criticism as netizens cheer on doctors - much like Americans across party lines have hailed Dr Anthony Fauci, the 79-year-old veteran head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \n Mr Trump's 2016 upset win, Britain's vote to leave the European Union and other populist victories had been seen as proof \"that the technocrats failed\" following the Great Recession of the late 2000s and the Iraq war, Mr Green said. \n \"I think it's very possible that the macro result this time could be that the political populists failed and it's the technocrats who emerge as the heroes,\" Mr Green said. \n \"We'll see.

Russia has faced numerous rounds of Western sanctions following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. \n The world's 20 most industrialised countries are scrambling to defend their virus-wracked economies amid forecasts they will likely plunge into a recession. \n On Wednesday, the financial ratings agency Moody's estimated the G20's overall gross domestic product would contract by 0.5 percent this year, with the US economy shrinking by 2.0 percent and the eurozone by 2.2 percent. \n 'NOT ENOUGH' \n \"The G20 declaration on the Covid-19 pandemic is a document of global resolve,\" said Markus Engels, from the Global Solutions Initiative, a network of think tanks. \n \"The lesson the G20 leaders take away from their meeting should be that social and international solidarity must once again be acknowledged as the most important instrument for combating the crisis.\" \n But amid warnings that tens of millions of lives could be lost to the virus globally, international aid agency Oxfam said the G20 action was \"not enough\". \n \"The world's richest governments are still only warming up to the scale of the task,\" said Chema Vera, Oxfam's interim executive director. \n \"G20 leaders must set a truly ambitious plan... to save lives, including a massive injection of funds into public health around the globe.\" \n This week, Macron and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping pushed for an emergency G20 summit to limit the impact of the pandemic. \n The lack of immediate action stood in contrast to the 2008 financial crisis, when the group quickly swung into action to mobilise assistance for vulnerable countries. \n 'PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO' \n Talk of global coordination has yet to resonate under Trump's isolationist presidency. \n On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took aim at China, saying the top diplomats of the Group of Seven agreed with him that Beijing was waging a \"disinformation\" campaign about the pandemic. \n At the G7 talks, a day before the G20 summit, Pompeo alleged Beijing was engaged in a social media campaign that included conspiracy theories centering on the US being behind the virus, which was first detected in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan.  \n The G7 failed to agree on a joint declaration amid Pompeo's insistence on labelling the coronavirus as the \"Wuhan virus\", US media reported. \n \"The US has provided a perfect example of what not to do as the country pushes its 'US-first' ideology to the extreme,\" said Engels. \n Crude oil prices  hammered by the coronavirus outbreak's impact on demand as well as by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia — were also expected to be at the centre of the discussions. \n Riyadh faces pressure from Washington to row back on its decision to hike production and offer the biggest price cuts in two decades, in retaliation for Russia's refusal to tighten supply as the virus sapped demand. \n On Wednesday, Pompeo urged Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to \"rise to the occasion\" and \"reassure global energy and financial markets\". \n However, the Kremlin said \"the oil topic\" was off the table.

Hence, there is a delay in transportation of the mortal remains of Rita Rajinder Mehra to India by the agency hired by Puneet Mehra, Kumar said in his reply.\nThe consular also said that as per the existing regulations in China, funeral homes in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou only are authorised to carry out embalming and anti-sepsis procedures of mortal remains of a foreigner for air transportation.\nAs of now, the Chinese government has placed complete restrictions on the funeral homes from accepting a body from any place out of these three cities. It means these funeral homes can only deal with the body that pertains to the respective city, he mentioned.\nAnother major obstacle in transporting the mortal remains from the morgue of Zhengzhou to Beijing is severe restrictions on inter-provincial movements, he informed Mehra.\n\"While it is going to be our earnest endeavour with the Chinese authorities to seek their indulgence in allowing the concession in the imposed regulations to allow the mortal remains to be transported to India, yet we cannot predict at this stage whether our pursuance would melt the Chinese authorities,\" Kumar said.\n\"However, we will try our hardest and hope as well as pray that we succeed.

Hong Kong/Canada/New York (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - Private organizations and government agencies are scrambling to implement business continuity planning (BCP) measures for the 2019 novel coronavirus, an infectious disease that came into broader public knowledge mere weeks ago.\nTo date, more than 17,000 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus have been documented worldwide, with the majority of the cases clustered in Hubei province, China. To try to curb infection rates, the Chinese government has implemented social distancing policies which have substantially slowed business activity in the region. Other countries are increasingly implementing ad hoc measures, including travel restrictions and quarantine measures, to prevent an outbreak from occurring in their respective jurisdictions.\nDevelopments are unfolding at an accelerated pace and organizations have much ground to cover in BCPs. The maintenance of operational agility, succession planning and employee morale are just some of the main considerations at play.\nIn mainland China, the Chinese government has extended the Chinese New Year holiday through February 2, to encourage social distancing to mitigate the spread of the virus. Provincial and national regulators have issued guidance for employers regarding employee rights and entitlements to remuneration during this time. Uncertainty regarding the interpretation of these regulatory notices has caused confusion over whether some business continuity practices, such as requesting employees to use vacation days during the extended holiday, are legal.\nEnterprise Singapore, a government agency, has issued a guide{here} on business continuity planning for the novel coronavirus. The guide recommends that businesses appoint a designated manager to oversee coronavirus-related business continuity measures. The importance of succession planning for key personnel in addition to senior managers, including communications, human resources and operations staff is heavily emphasized. Businesses are also advised to establish alternate teams for critical operational functions and to keep these teams physically segregated at all times.\nIn practice, segregating teams may require businesses to place extensive restrictions on employees, even outside working hours. For example, the South China Morning Post, an English language newspaper in Hong Kong, established separate workspaces for alternate teams in different districts of the city during a regional outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Alternate teams were sent to work in different locations and were prohibited from having any physical contact with members of the other team during and after work hours for a period of three months.\nMany companies in Hong Kong have activated extensive BCPs for the novel coronavirus in comparison to jurisdictions with similar numbers of confirmed cases, partially due to containment measures from the local government, lessons learned during the SARs outbreak and the region’s close proximity to mainland China. Measures that have been implemented include remote working arrangements for a large percentage of the workforce. Some companies have provided personal protection supplies such as surgical masks and hand disinfectant for employees who have to come to the office to perform their job duties. Policies suspending business travel to cluster areas for the coronavirus have been implemented by numerous businesses. Some organizations have even sought to prohibit employee personal travel to cluster areas.\nIn comparison, there have been fewer reports of companies in South Korea, Japan or Thailand implementing business continuity measures such as asking employees to work from home or limiting employee travel.\nIn Canada, some businesses have begun to execute pandemic preparedness measures such as training staff on what to do if they encounter someone who is ill, or if a customer-facing employee should fall ill at work. Local disaster management experts have expressed concern that some organizations, especially smaller firms, may lack the adequate resources or expertise to put measures in place that can effectively deal with employee health and operational risks posed by the novel coronavirus.\nInternationally, businesses are struggling with disruptions to their supply chains in China{here}, where manufacturing and logistics activity has slowed to a crawl across the country. Technology companies are expected to be most affected; however, many other commodities, goods and services will also be significantly affected. Companies such as H&M, Japan Airlines, Baidu Inc, McDonald's and Tesla have all recently warned that the outbreak in China will have an impact on their businesses.\nBCP for the novel coronavirus is proving to be difficult, requiring businesses to consider operational and financial risks alongside health risks to one of their most valuable assets: talent. Safeguarding the wellbeing of employees plays an important role in keeping a company operational during this uncertain time. While practices implemented by companies have delved into infection control measures such as personal hygiene and social distancing, challenges in maintaining employee morale have not been discussed with the same fervor.\nSome important issues to consider in BCPs include how to handle fear and xenophobia that have arisen due to concerns over the novel coronavirus. BCP designated personnel need to consider how to manage anxiety in the workplace, even over scenarios that would be benign during normal times, such as an employee who shows up to work with a minor cough.\nBusinesses that choose to implement work from home arrangements for large swathes of the workforce will need to consider how to help employees who are not accustomed to working remotely stay motivated during this time, alongside infrastructure concerns such as bandwidth and capacity issues for remote access of work servers, conferencing lines and other necessities.\nMoreover, managers must consider how to balance their legal responsibility to treat all employees fairly against any measures the company may have to take to mitigate the risk of widespread infection at their firms. Consideration for the mental wellbeing of employees needs to be factored in alongside practices to safeguard their physical health against illness.\nPlanning for an extended and uncertain period time in which businesses may have to run on contingency measures is another significant consideration for businesses. The novel coronavirus remains somewhat of a mystery. Health agencies are in the midst of containment efforts; however, it is uncertain how long these initiatives may take to bring regional outbreaks under control, or if these initiatives will be successful at all in preventing more widespread infection. As a result, businesses must examine how they will function under different scenarios and at varying percentages of operational capacity. Critical tasks will have to be identified and many organizations will have to make tough decisions weighing risk against productivity just in order to stay afloat.\n*To read more by the Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence team click here: bit.ly/TR-RegIntel\n(By Helen Chan, Regulatory Intelligence)\n"}, {"content": "Breakingviews - China’s viral immune system open to economic pox. HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s political system has weak immunity to viruses. A bungled swine flu cover-up doubled pork prices last year. Now a mysterious outbreak of pneumonia is panicking citizens just days before the start of what’s usually a $150 billion spending boom: the lunar new year holiday. President Xi Jinping’s corruption purge may have made officials less venal, but not, apparently, more credible.\nConcealing epidemics, environmental crises, and product scandals was once reflexive behaviour for local governments. Burying bad news can head off career-ending popular protests. Now officials must manage the flow of facts and rumour about a virus that emerged in Wuhan, a large city in central China.\nWhen it comes to infectious disease, local censorship slows medical response and facilitates transmission. That’s what happened with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, a coronavirus similar to that found in Wuhan. SARS killed nearly 800 people, docked a percentage point from China’s economic growth, and erased up to $18 billion in travel, tourism and retail sales in Asia, according to one academic estimate.\nBeijing scored transparency points with its handling of the H7N9 avian flu in 2013, but then fumbled its response to African swine flu, which some officials initially tried to cover up. Around half of China’s herd had to be culled.\nDistrust is a tax that distorts consumption. After the Sichuan earthquake in 2008, some residents of the provincial capital disregarded official reassurances, hoarding bottled water and camping outside for months on end, refusing to believe their buildings were safe. The 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan caused a bizarre rush on iodized salt in China.\nThe coronavirus has already killed four and infected hundreds. It has spread overseas. With an estimated 400 million Chinese planning to travel for the holiday, the question is how many will still go and spend.\nXi’s massive purge of corrupt officials made him popular, but it was packaged with tighter control of media, and suppression of negative economic commentary. This encourages officials to report only good news, so some will naturally try to control disease outbreaks before they become public. When that backfires, the result is personal tragedy and economic waste.\n"}, {"content": "Programa de rádio faz esclarecimento sobre sátira relativa ao coronavírus que revoltou comunidade chinesa.

SINGAPORE: Like many others on the frontline during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003, the resources of a family clinic in Choa Chu Kang had been stretched thin. \n Personal protective equipment - N95 respirators, sterile gloves and full-body gowns - was scarce at a time when the world had never seen a virus like it, and people everywhere were desperately scrambling to stockpile emergency supplies for themselves. \n Dr Tan Tze Lee, a general practitioner at the Edinburgh Clinic, recalled the difficulties that frontline healthcare workers faced when procuring equipment to protect themselves from the killer virus. \n By the time SARS was contained in May 2003, it had infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers. \n While Dr Tan’s clinic thankfully encountered no cases, it remained on high alert for SARS patients in the four months of the epidemic in Singapore, throughout which the medical staff had to don full protective gear. But everyone was not ready for the crisis, said Dr Tan, who is also president of the College of Family Physicians Singapore. \n Many continued to work but were extremely concerned that they might bring the virus home and put their loved ones at risk, he added. \n “The healthcare practitioners in Singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. Since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event.” \n “Here we are today, ready to fight the 2019-nCoV,” he said. \n The current outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus - or 2019-nCoV, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) temporary name for the virus - was first confirmed in Singapore on Jan 23. To date, all cases were imported, including a Singaporean who was in Wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the Republic. \n The WHO has yet to declare the virus - which has spread to several countries - as a pandemic. Nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on Friday (Jan 31). \n The first cases were reported in Wuhan in China’s Hubei province and believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live animals. \n At the heart of Singapore's response plan is the Disease Outbreak Response System (DORS), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after SARS and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or H1N1) pandemic in 2009. \n  \n “After SARS, we made a thorough review of the facilities we had – the infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and the scientific testing and capabilities,” said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week. \n “I think we are much better prepared now.” \n Currently, Singapore is at DORS condition (DORSCON) Yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The next step up is DORSCON Orange, which would have applied in the case of SARS, whereby the virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. \n While the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, Singapore’s national strategy is still largely untested - since the Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the Republic, medical experts and SARS veterans said. \n However, there are ample signs that the lessons from SARS are being applied as Singapore shores up its defences, they said. They believe that unlike during SARS, Singapore is far more ready now. \n LESSONS LEARNT \n Singapore has had two brushes with pandemics in recent memory - SARS and H1N1. \n While Singapore was able to contain and recover from both, the varying nature of the viruses, as well as the changes in medical science, meant that dealing with each required different approaches. \n Doctors had limited options when treating SARS patients and could only administer supportive care, and there was nothing that could be done to prevent infection. In comparison, vaccines and treatment options were available when H1N1 claimed 18 lives in Singapore and infected more than 400,000 people, out of which about 1,300 had to be hospitalised. \n COMMAND AND CONTROL \n SARS first arrived in Singapore in late February 2003, and was detected in a woman with an atypical pneumonia on March 1, 2003 at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). At the time, no one knew how deadly and virulent it was and the first patient led to a cluster of 42 cases at the hospital. \n A Ministry of Health (MOH) taskforce was set up on Mar 15, two weeks after the mysterious strain appeared in Singapore and three days after the WHO issued a global alert on the outbreak that began in Hong Kong. \n But the command and control structure then was “wholly inadequate” in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, a study in the Austrian Journal of South-east Asian Studies concluded in 2012. \n  \n The structure was led by the health authorities, when in hindsight, it required “more than a medical approach since resources had to be drawn from a number of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the MOH”, said authors Allen Lai and Tan Teck Boon, who were from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \n They noted that it took five weeks after the first case was reported for the bureaucracy to adapt, though by then, the outbreak had already spread quickly out of TTSH. \n On April 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to SARS, comprising a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng to provide strategic and political directions during health crises. \n Helping to coordinate across silos were a core executive group of senior civil servants, and an operations committee spanning ministries. Their functions were later consolidated during the H1N1 crisis, which meant that this leaner bureaucracy was quicker to respond to emerging situations on the ground. \n With the Wuhan coronavirus, observers said that it was evident that the Government had reacted more quickly than in SARS and H1N1 when it came to establishing a multi-disciplinary decision-making body. \n Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the Wuhan coronavirus was formed on Jan 22, several hours before the first suspected case came to the attention of the authorities at 10pm the same day. The patient - a 66-year-old Chinese national tourist from Wuhan - tested positive the next day, becoming the first confirmed case in Singapore. \n “If you look at the response time, it is a fact that the ministerial committee formed before the case appeared, and we can see that a lot of systems are already in place, occurring across ministries and not as siloed as back then when SARS caught us all by surprise,” said Prof Ooi, who is also deputy director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme at Duke-NUS Medical School. \n The taskforce was formed to direct the whole-of-government response to the outbreak, coordinate the public’s response and work with the international community. \n Jointly chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of Cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios. They are: \n Dr Chia Shi-Lu, a Tanjong Pagar GRC Member of Parliament who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, said that this time, the chain of command is clearer. \n He noted that even before the taskforce was formed, the MOH had already begun tracking the outbreak in China at the start of the year. Temperature screening measures were put in place at Changi Airport from as early as Jan 3. \n But the high political signature of the panel had led some to question whether too many cooks were spoiling the broth, Dr Chia noted. “In fact, some have asked me: Are we overdoing it?” he said. \n “I believe it is very important for everybody to come into the picture - you have to, because at this early stage, (the outbreak) affects so many different parts and you need leadership from them, and you cannot rely solely on MOH to coordinate everything,” he added. \n  \n INFRASTRUCTURE, CASE MANAGEMENT AND ISOLATION \n While information about the Wuhan virus is still emerging, Singapore is not in the same position as in the initial stages of the SARS outbreak in 2003, where it was - in the words of then Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang - “flying blind”. \n During the SARS crisis, Singapore only had two means to detect those infected with the virus: Their clinical symptoms and their travel history. Detecting these were not easy at the time as temperature screeners were also a rare resource, unlike today. \n “We have to depend on people taking temperature, and we have to depend on people being truthful to us in their contact history,” said Mr Lim then, describing SARS as a tremendous challenge. \n Dr Tan Yia Swam, First Vice-President of the Singapore Medical Association (SMA), said that in the SARS crisis, “there were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly”. SARS was zoonotic in nature, with the disease starting in animals before spreading to humans. \n As a result, policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said. \n “Today, all of the above have been developed and tested before in exercises and they are now put into action. Of course, these plans, policies and procedures must be modified in line with the epidemiology of the disease, but we are not working from scratch, unlike the past experience with SARS,” she added. \n  \n Addressing the media on Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong said that in the taskforce’s national response to the virus, it is able to “marshal all available resources” to tackle the scourge. \n In terms of capacity, Singapore has already beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003. This includes the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases that opened last year, and new hospitals such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in 2010, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in 2015, and Sengkang General Hospital in 2018, he said. \n During SARS, TTSH was known as “SARSCentral”, the designated hospital to handle patients. This was borne out of a policy to restrict transmission of the virus to other hospitals, after a patient - who was unaware that he had been infected with the virus during his stay in TTSH - created a new viral cluster at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) when he went there for a surgical problem after his discharge from TTSH. \n This policy changed in 2009 during the H1N1 outbreak, with the Health Ministry imposing a standardised infection control measure on all healthcare facilities, empowered by timely tweaks to the Infectious Diseases Act. More than 400 family clinics were made “H1N1-ready” and equipped with the Tamiflu vaccine to handle the outbreak. \n  \n Similarly, all public hospitals are capable of handling the Wuhan virus today, and come equipped with isolation rooms, which were in short supply in 2003. \n When it came to medical supplies, Dr Chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as N95 respirators. \n “Because an N95 mask needs to fit well for it to perform its function, having a properly fitted mask was (hard to come by) during SARS, and we had to find time to do the fitting too,” said Dr Chia, who was an orthopaedic surgeon at SGH at the height of the crisis. \n “Today, most of us are already fitted with our own personal equipment, even as new staff. Everything is in place today,” he said. \n  \n For the general public, the Government will be disbursing a pack of four surgical masks to each of the 1.37 million Singapore households in a one-off exercise between Feb 1 and Feb 9. This was also done in 2003 when all households received a free emergency kit, containing N95 masks and themometers. \n This time round, the mask distribution comes amid long queues at pharmacies around the island as people clamour to buy masks, and retailers say their stocks of surgical masks and N95 masks are running low or sold out. The Government had released 5 million masks from its stockpile over nine days to the retailers but they were all snapped up in hours. \n Said Dr Chia: “The message is that there is enough for the whole of the population and in reserve too.” \n SMA’s Dr Tan said his association met with the College of Family Physicians Singapore over the Chinese New Year weekend to carry out “complex logistics arrangements” to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and N95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers. \n “We are all monitoring the situation closely, and are ready to step up efforts when the need arises,” he said. \n Experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too - student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the Outward Bound Singapore on Pulau Ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site. \n  \n TRICKY BALANCE IN THE FACE OF IMPONDERABLES \n On Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong also called on Singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the Wuhan virus could be worse than SARS given the many “imponderables” and “uncertainties” regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in Singapore. \n Over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of China have surfaced in Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Germany. \n Mr Lawrence Wong said Singapore’s approach “is to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can”. “But every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,” he added. \n  \n Unlike SARS, which impacted Singapore when little was known about it, there is now a greater understanding about the coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the Wuhan strain and SARS. \n But data gaps still exist, said Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the WHO’s research policy and cooperation department in Geneva. \n Prof Pangestu said that not much is known of the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus the severe and fatal ones, which currently makes it difficult to evaluate the Wuhan virus’ true epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response. \n There is also the worry that the virus could mutate into a more virulent and more highly transmissible strain. “This needs close monitoring and another data gap will be in how quickly this development can be evaluated,” he said. \n Despite these gaps, Singapore has “reacted much more swiftly and comprehensively” than in 2003, Prof Pangestu added. \n  \n A rule of thumb for any country’s approach in health crises, he said, is to base decisions on scientific evidence and rational analysis in the context of its own capacities. \n “I think the Singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available - robust but not over-reactive and flexible enough to accommodate new developments,” said Prof Pangestu. \n He noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. Under-reaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus. \n “Calibrating the balance is tricky, but as I said, base your decisions on the existing scientific evidence,” said Prof Pangestu. \n Prof Ooi from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health added: “There is a risk and cost to overreaction and a cost to an under-reaction. Nobody knows what is the right answer and there is no hard science to it - this is a judgement call and there is no right or wrong.” \n Where there is a dearth of knowledge on imported pandemic cases, Singapore’s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances, and the plan recommends taking border control measures that would “err on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer”. \n Addressing the media on Friday, Mr Lee said: “I think as a Government, in a way, we are overreacting because we are trying to look ahead to see what can go wrong and take preemptive steps to prevent that from happening.” \n Within a week, the taskforce moved from allowing travellers from Wuhan to enter Singapore while subject to enhanced screening on Monday, to imposing a complete entry ban on all nationalities who have been to China in the past 14 days on Friday. \n The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority has also stopped issuing all forms of new visas to those with People’s Republic of China passports. \n HANDLING A PSYCHOLOGICAL CRISIS \n Although the memory of SARS may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more Singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis. \n For example, social media is rife with examples of Singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. The Government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour. But Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, believes that the SARS legacy can also be a double-edged sword: The prospect of another SARS-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, “kiasuism”. \n  \n In a viral outbreak, being  “kiasu” means that people only think for themselves, preventing mutual cooperation from happening, he said. \n Urging Singaporeans to do better, Dr Leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. If fear and panic take hold, they can overwhelm the country’s response “like a tsunami”, he said. \n This means Singapore’s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said. \n “You have no time to get ready. Better to be ready (for the worst) now than not ready at all … There is little room for mistakes (that create more panic),” said Dr Leong. \n  \n Dr Chia believes that Singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an MP or his interactions with patients. \n “During SARS, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone. We had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening … But so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among Singaporeans,” he said. \n The rise of social media, which was non-existent during SARS , can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic. \n On the threat of fake news, SMA’s Dr Tan said: “Social media may do more harm than good in this kind of situation where fake news may spread faster than a virus and trigger unwanted behaviours. We urge all readers to exercise judgement when reading stories from various sources, and to keep referencing to official websites for accurate information.” \n STRONGER LEGISLATION \n Compared with the SARS crisis, Singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour - the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act being one of them. \n Lesser known are the many enhancements to the Infectious Diseases Act over the years since 2003, which give the authorities greater powers to enforce orders that were issued in the fight against a gazetted outbreak. \n The Act allows people who break home quarantine orders to be arrested without a warrant and to be jailed or fined on conviction. It was amended last year to allow officers to use “physical means” to enforce the order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation, in lieu of arrest. \n It also makes explicit that persons under legal orders that restrict their movement in Singapore, would not be allowed to leave the country, unless otherwise permitted. \n The breadth of such powers in Singapore gives the authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics, such as those described by Dr Chia, cannot happen again. The issue became such a problem during the SARS crisis that the health authorities had to resort to draconian measures, such as installing video surveillance cameras in the homes of people who were ordered to be quarantined. \n The lack of legal powers has created some difficulties for several foreign governments in dealing with the Wuhan coronavirus. Earlier this week, two Japanese citizens who were brought back to Japan from Wuhan on a chartered flight declined to go for medical screening when they landed in Tokyo. \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the Japanese Parliament: \"While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so.\" \n MORAL SUASION AND IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC COMMS \n But over the longer term, evidence suggests that government measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions are not as effective as instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people. \n Having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when the authorities need the people’s support to carry out certain measures, noted Prof Pangestu. \n  \n Prof Pangestu said: “You need the public’s cooperation for your measures to be successful, such as to follow good hygiene practices, be alert to any symptoms, promptly seeking healthcare, awareness of potential risks, and to counter the spread of misinformation on social media.” \n This will be critical during the “surge response” - when situational changes cause a sudden need for the authorities to ramp up its measures, such as activating quarantine sites that are being held in reserve. \n A lack of moral suasion would erase the ability for the Government to implement these measures, experts said. They noted how in Hong Kong, protesters bombed a general hospital and a residential building that the authorities had wanted to use as a possible quarantine facility. \n Over the past week, South Korean protesters - mostly residents - also used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, which are about 80km from Seoul. \n Experts said cooperation from the masses largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation that can lead to miscommunication. \n An April 2003 article in The Straits Times, \"All the right moves for SARSbut info’s a bit slow, no?\", by its then news editor Bertha Henson, described how the MOH was asked at a press conference to confirm a tipoff that SGH nurses might have SARS. The authorities said no, but it later emerged the next day that 21 SGH staff were on the SARS suspect list. \n “The kindest thing I can say about this sudden announcement is that the ministry gets its information later than the media,” wrote Ms Henson then. \n Referring to the incident, Professor Chee Yam Cheng, the current president of the Singapore Medical Council, wrote in a series of memos about SARS in 2003 that “quick dissemination of information - and accurate information - is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency”. \n Prof Pangestu believes that in general, Singaporeans are united and support what the Government is trying to do to contain the situation. \n “But public reaction is hard to control especially with fake news on social media. The idea that ‘perception is reality, anything is the truth’ often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment.

Uma equipa de cientistas chineses demonstrou que os pangolins são portadores de coronavírus estreitamente relacionados com a SARS-CoV-2, causadora da atual pandemia, mas não o suficiente para concluir que são responsáveis diretos pela transmissão do vírus aos humanos.\r\nA SARS-CoV-2 surgiu num mercado de Wuhan (China) em que se vendiam animais selvagens e, apesar de haver provas que sugerem que os morcegos são o reservatório da síndrome, hoje os cientistas continuam sem saber que animal pode ser o hóspede intermediário que facilitou a transmissão do vírus aos humanos.\n\nHoje, um estudo genómico, liderado pelos virologistas chineses Yi Guan, da Universidade de Hong Kong, e Yan-Ling Hu, da Universidade de Medicina de Guangxi, publicado na revista Nature, avança que os pangolins malaios são portadores de coronavírus relacionados com SARS-CoV-2.\nA semelhança entre esses coronavírus e o que causou a pandemia não é suficiente para confirmar se os pangolins são os hóspedes que transmitiram o atual surto de SARS-CoV-2 dos morcegos aos humanos, mas as descobertas sugerem que estes mamíferos selvagens são \"um segundo hóspede dos coronavírus\", pelo que a venda nos mercados de fauna selvagem deveria estar estritamente proibida para evitar futuras transmissões, advertem os cientistas.\nNo estudo, recordam que pouco depois do início do surto, o mercado de Wuhan - o foco inicial da infeção - foi desmantelado, o que impediu recolher a espécie animal em que surgiu o coronavírus.\nUm possível hóspede poderia ser o pangolim, o mamífero mais traficado e que se utiliza como alimento e na medicina tradicional chinesa.\nPara o trabalho, Yi Guan e os colegas analisaram amostras de 18 pangolins malaios apreendidos em operações de luta contra o contrabando no sul da China, entre agosto de 2017 e janeiro de 2018, e em todos encontraram diferentes tipos de coronavírus.\nOs vírus destas amostras tinham uma semelhança genética entre 85% a 92% com a SARS-CoV-2.\nAlém do mais, num destes vírus, a região que facilita a entrada na célula é muito similar à do vírus atual.\nNão obstante, nenhum dos coronavírus de pangolim tinha a alteração específica da SARS-CoV-2 humana, o que suscita dúvidas de que os pangolins sejam responsáveis diretos na transmissão do coronavírus aos humanos.\nAinda assim, os autores do estudo advertem que os pangolins não deveriam vender-se em mercados e propõem uma maior vigilância destes animais para compreender o seu papel no surgimento de coronavírus com potencial para infetar os seres humanos.\nO novo coronavírus, responsável pela pandemia da covid-19, já infetou mais 480.000 pessoas em todo o mundo, das quais cerca de 22.000 morreram.\nDepois de surgir na China, em dezembro, o surto espalhou-se por todo o mundo, o que levou a Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) a declarar uma situação de pandemia.\nO continente europeu, com quase 260.000 infetados, é aquele onde está a surgir atualmente o maior número de casos.

SINGAPORE — As Singapore steps up the battle against Covid-19, with the outbreak still largely contained, some people living here are worried about their relatives in corners of the globe that are suffering the worst death tolls from the virus outside China. \n These people — originally from Italy, Iran and South Korea — are glued to their television and mobile phone screens, constantly refreshing their social media feeds for the latest news back home, where the death toll has risen alarmingly in recent weeks. \n For some of them, the anxiety of being so far from loved ones at such a difficult time has been made harder by insensitive humour over Covid-19 on social media. \n Italy has more than 2,000 Covid-19 cases, with a death toll of 52. In Iran, 66 people have died, with reported infections topping 1,500. And in South Korea, 28 people have died with more than 5,000 cases reported. \n The Ministry of Health said on Tuesday (March 3) that all new visitors who have travelled to Iran, northern Italy or South Korea within the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter Singapore from 11:59pm on Wednesday, after the World Health Organization named these three countries, alongside Japan, as the ones of greatest concern in the fight against Covid-19. \n Ms Hayedeh, 50, who declined to give her family name, moved to Singapore from Iran more than 30 years ago. She feels “helpless” about the situation in Iran. \n “When the virus started in Singapore, I took it a lot better because I saw how Singapore handled Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003). I don’t feel worried because I know I am in good hands. The Government is taking care of everything in an amazing way,” the home chef, who is a permanent resident, said. \n “But I’m worried for them (in Iran) because it’s a huge country. The number of people and awareness is different.”  \n Mr Mohammad Jafari, 56, a businessman who moved to Singapore from Iran in 1993 shares the same sentiments. \n “When the virus started spreading here, my brother (in Iran) told me to be careful. They were worried because Singapore is close to China and many Chinese people visit Singapore. I told them not to worry because Singapore has the situation under control, implementing effective quarantine measures,” Mr Jafari, who has been a Singapore citizen for more than 15 years, said. \n Ms Hayedeh remains worried about her friends and family who are avoiding social gatherings and staying home, but she refrains from calling them “more than usual” because she does not want to “give them stress or anxiety.” \n A sense of excitement that should be felt with the Iranian New Year, or Nowruz, being just around the corner on March 20, is replaced by largely empty roads and even emptier stores there. \n Ms Hayedeh said: “No one has the mood to go out to shop. Like Chinese New Year, before Nowruz, everybody goes out to shop, buy new clothes, food, sweets and house decorations. Businesses are very affected.” \n Researcher Alireza Javadian, 34, who is here on an employment pass, said: “Many travel agencies that sold tour packages to visitors hoping to go to Iran to celebrate the new year received a lot of cancellations.” \n  \n Mr Alireza Javadian, an Iranian who is a researcher on an employment pass in Singapore, during a visit to Cambodia. Photo: Alireza Javadian \n Ms Hayedeh thinks that Nowruz will be celebrated “in a different manner” this year. “Usually on Nowruz, we gather and hug and kiss but this year, they cannot even do that anymore,” she said. \n 'SAD FOR PEOPLE IN SOUTH KOREA' \n Ms Kim Ye Sing, 24, who is a Singaporean permanent resident, said that both the Singaporean and South Korean authorities are handling the outbreak well. She also said that living here made her realise \"how ready Singapore is to fight and protect its people”. \n She used to work as a flight cabin crew and is moving to the banking field. \n “I’m very sure the government in South Korea also did the best it could to contain the virus but it was already spreading so quickly,” she said. \n “The official in charge of managing Covid-19 even commited suicide. It just shows how troubled the official was.” \n She added: “I feel really worried and sad for my people in (South Korea). I hope things will get better soon.” \n Two weeks ago, a South Korean undergraduate, Ms Eunbin Cho, 22, had to cancel her flight to Seoul on March 11 to visit her family there but could not obtain a refund because there were no official travel restrictions at that time. \n She said that she is worried about her family being there as the number of infections keep going up. \n “Today I saw that there were five new cases at the exact location where my grandparents and parents are living, in Gangnam (a district in Seoul). It’s so bad,” she told TODAY on Monday. “There are confirmed cases everywhere.” \n Ms Cho said that she is deeply saddened by the situation in South Korea and was upset to see comments on Facebook making jokes about it. \n On a Facebook page of a Singapore media outlet, she found comments that were \"very bad\", trying to be funny and saying things such as \"Train to Daegu\", an apparent reference to Train to Busan, a Korean zombie film. \n “But it’s not funny at all,” she said. “They keep making fun of it by saying it’s like a Korean drama. It’s quite hurtful for me to read it because they’re taking it as a joke.” \n Television producer Christine Park, 25, a Singapore permanent resident, said that more people are avoiding crowded places in Seoul. \n “My relatives are scared, they won't leave the house much and won’t eat out. My cousin in fourth grade usually has piano, taekwondo classes but is not going to go for them anymore.” \n 'BUSINESSES CLOSING EARLY IN ITALY' \n Writer Edoardo Liotta, 23, who has been in Singapore since he was a year old, said that he was worried about his family in Italy. \n Most of Mr Liotta’s family members live in Rome, but his cousin lives in Milan which is a major hotspot for Covid-19. \n “I text my cousin in Milan more often because she is much closer to the outbreak areas. She has had to work from home and all big gatherings have been cancelled,” Mr Liotta said. \n He added that the situation is being handled well by the Italian authorities. \n “Generally, I think the (Italian government) is doing really well considering they did the most tests compared to any other European country,” he said. \n “They were fast to lock down towns that had outbreaks. The city of Milan has been quite empty to reduce transmission and there are roadblocks and many other efforts in place.” \n Another Italian on an employment pass who wants to be known only as Mr Francesco, 28, subscribes to the Gov.sg WhatsApp channel and thinks that direct channels of information are a good way to help the Singapore Government coordinate communication to the public. \n “The channel helps people to understand the situation better which helps reduce panic,” he said, adding that officials in Italy disseminate information only through the media. \n Friends and relatives in Italy tell him that some businesses are closing earlier there as the Covid-19 crisis deepens. \n “Some bars are closed after 6pm to avoid crowds, so are theatres and clubs,” he said, adding that restaurants have not closed because only crowded places will be closed in the evening. \n Mr Alan Serrecchia, 40, a sales manager on an employment pass here, also said that the Italian government is managing the outbreak well but he hopes that this health crisis will all end quickly. \n “I hope that it will be over soon for everyone,” he added “And I hope that we can endure this situation.” \n "}, {"content": "Enfermeira acusa China de mentir e garante que já há 90 mil infetados por coronavírus.

The stakes are higher now that the virus has started spreading from human to human. \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. All general practice doctors have also been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspected patients. \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID. Those 16 and younger will be taken to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. This is to nip the spread of the virus in the bud. The ambulance will then be cleaned before it is used again. \n At the NCID, the patients will be placed in special negative-pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters. \n Prof Leo said the NCID has \"high-end\" Hepa filters in 124 negative-pressure isolation rooms which clean 99.999 per cent of contaminants, including viruses. \n As an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays. \n It will take the laboratory between four and eight hours to determine if the patient is infected with a coronavirus. If that test proves positive, genetic sequencing will be done to confirm that it is the new bug. That takes 24 hours. \n Prof Leo said there are a lot of coronaviruses but only seven, including this new one, that spread from human to human. \n Four types cause the common cold and are mild. The other two are the more dangerous Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). \n A negative-pressure isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.

ST PHOTO: DESMOND FOO \n Fifteen medical staff in Wuhan have contracted the bug, currently called the 2019-nCoV. \n Prof Leo said that it is not yet known whether this virus is as dangerous as Sars. \n But Singapore is not taking chances. All medical staff dealing with suspected cases are well protected with personal protective equipment (PPE). Laboratory staff will also have PPE and powered air-purifying respirators - to filter out any possible virus. \n Prof Leo said Singapore has a stockpile of the disposable PPE as well as the powered air-purifying respirators - enough to supply all hospitals, should a major outbreak occur here. \"Yes it is expensive, but protection of staff is the most important thing,\" said Prof Leo, a veteran of the Sars outbreak in 2003, when medical staff caring for infected patients were among the 238 people infected and the 33 who died. \n The 330-bed NCID, which opened slightly over a year ago, has more than 100 \"surge beds\", which are kept empty and on standby for national emergencies. \n All medical staff dealing with suspected cases are well protected with personal protective equipment (PPE). Laboratory staff will also have PPE and powered air-purifying respirators - to filter out any possible virus. ST PHOTO: DESMOND FOO \n Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. ST PHOTO: DESMOND FOO \n Although the flu vaccine does not protect against the Wuhan bug, she said it is a good idea to get vaccinated. On a national level, it will \"cut down on the background noise\". \n She added that should there be a positive case of the Wuhan bug here, people will be told. \n \"We need to be able to share the information and be able to guide the public, as well as the entire public healthcare system, to be able to handle the situation,\" she said. \n WIDER DEFINITION \n Singapore's Ministry of Health has widened its definition of suspect cases, and it will now include anyone with pneumonia who had been to China - not just Wuhan - within 14 days of the start of the illness. Anyone with acute respiratory infection who has been to any hospital in China within a fortnight of getting ill will also be treated as a suspect case. \n MORE SCREENINGS \n From today, Changi Airport will conduct temperature screening for all flights from China, and not just those from Wuhan. So far, all seven suspected cases in Singapore have proven not to have the Wuhan bug. \n SUSPECT CASES \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. At the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), the patients will be placed in special negative pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters. As an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays. \n GP DOCS ON THE WATCH \n All general practice doctors have been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspect patients. \n SPECIAL AMBULANCES \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID. Those 16 and younger will be taken to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. This is to nip the spread of the virus in the bud. The ambulance will then be properly cleaned before it is used again. \n • Avoid contact with live animals, including poultry and birds.

NEW YORK (BLOOMBERG) - The drug touted by United States President Donald Trump as a possible line of treatment against the coronavirus comes with severe warnings in China and can kill in dosages as small as 2g. \n China, where the deadly pathogen first emerged in December, recommended the decades-old malaria drug chloroquine to treat infected patients in guidelines issued in February after seeing encouraging results in clinical trials. But within days, it cautioned doctors and health officials about the drug's lethal side effects and rolled back its usage. \n This came after local media reported that a Wuhan Institute of Virology study found that the drug can kill an adult dosed at just twice the daily amount recommended for treatment, which is 1g. \n As the drug has not been approved by the US Food And Drug Administration to treat the disease known as Covid-19, the Chinese experience may be useful as the American regulator studies the medication which has been endorsed by Mr Trump as well as Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk. \n The pandemic, which has sickened more than 235,000 globally and killed over 9,800 people, has triggered growing anxiety across the US as states say they lack testing kits and medical equipment. California instituted a statewide lockdown on Thursday (March 19) to slow the outbreak. \n Chloroquine was among the first group of therapies Chinese scientists identified as being effective in curbing the new coronavirus. Clinical trials on about 130 patients demonstrated the drug's ability to reduce the severity of the illness and speed up virus clearance, according to China's Ministry of Sciences and Technology. \n Chloroquine phosphate was officially recommended on Feb 19 in the Covid-19 treatment guidelines published by China's National Health Commission, along with a few other drugs such as AbbVie Inc's Kaletra and flu drug arbidol as antiviral treatments for patients. The commission recommended no more than a 10-day course of chloroquine for adult patients at 500mg - half a gram - twice a day. \n As hundreds of clinical trials are launched to study potential Covid-19 treatments, stocks of drugmakers and biotechnology companies have racked up big gains on the hope that the industry will see a windfall. But the history of previous viral outbreaks like Ebola and Zika show little success in producing viable treatments. Some potential drugs were developed only after the epidemics already waned through containment measures. \n China's recommendation to use chloroquine in treatment was quickly followed by a warning. \n Two days after the treatment guideline update, the health authorities in Hubei province - China's worst-hit region, where the outbreak started and which accounted for the majority of its over 80,000 patients - asked hospitals to closely watch for, and immediately report, any adverse side effects of chloroquine phosphate, according to a report in local media outlet The Paper. \n The drug is known to have short-term side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and tinnitus, while long-term use can irreversibly impair eyesight. It is forbidden for pregnant women, as it can cause congenital defects in babies. \n The China Health Commission revised the dosage in a Feb 29 notice tightening chloroquine use. The drug cannot be given to pregnant women, those with heart disease, terminal liver and renal disease, retina and hearing loss and patients on antibiotics such as azithromycin and steroid. \n It can now be given only to patients between 18 and 65 years of age for a seven-day treatment course. Patients weighing over 50kg can take 500mg twice a day - the usual dose - while those weighing less will be administered the drug just once a day after two days of use, according to the latest guidelines. \n "}, {"content": "Welche Einschränkungen jetzt auf Reisende zukommen. Ab Montag hat das Bundesinnenministerium (BMI) vorübergehende Grenzkontrollen angeordnet. Diese werden an den Binnengrenzen zu Österreich, der Schweiz, Frankreich, Luxemburg und Dänemark stattfinden.\nDeutsche Staatsangehörige, Personen mit Aufenthaltsstatus sowie erstem Wohnsitz in Deutschland dürfen nach wie vor nach Deutschland einreisen. Rückreisende aus Italien, Österreich und der Schweiz werden gebeten, sich nach ihrer Rückkehr 14 Tage lang zu Hause aufzuhalten. Dies gilt unabhängig davon, ob ein konkreter Corona-Verdachtsfall vorliegt oder nicht.\nNeue Leitlinien für Grenzkontrollen sollen den freien Warenverkehr im europäischen Binnenmarkt sicherstellen. Der grenzüberschreitende Verkehr von Waren sowie von Berufspendlern bleibt also gewährleistet. Letztere werden gebeten, einen Beleg für ihre Tätigkeit mitzuführen. Reisende \"ohne triftigen Reisegrund\" dürfen an den oben genannten Grenzen nicht mehr ein- und ausreisen.\nIn Einzelfällen kann auch ein persönlicher Grund als \"triftig\" gelten. Es liegt im Ermessen der Grenzpolizei, welche grenzüberschreitende Privatreise sie zulässt. Laut BMI sind die Beamtinnen und Beamten der Bundespolizei erfahren in der Beurteilung solcher Einzelfälle, da dies ihr tägliches Geschäft ist.\nZusätzlich zu Deutschland und vielen anderen Staaten wird auch die Europäische Union ab heute alle ihre Außengrenzen schließen. Reisen zwischen EU-Staaten und anderen Ländern werden für 30 Tage ausgesetzt. Die Maßnahme soll ab Dienstagmittag gelten.\nAusnahmen soll es laut der EU-Kommissionspräsidentin Ursula von der Leyen für Bürger mit dauerhafter Aufenthaltsgenehmigung für die EU geben. Ebenso für Angehörige von EU-Bürgern, Diplomaten, Ärzte, Krankenpfleger, Forscher und Experten. Und auch für Menschen, die wichtige Güter transportieren, sowie Pendler, die in der EU arbeiten.\nBund und Länder wollen den Tourismus in Deutschland drastisch einschränken. Am Montag verfügte die Bundesregierung, dass Übernachtungsangebote wie Hotels oder Herbergen in Deutschland vorerst \"nur zu notwendigen und ausdrücklich nicht zu touristischen Zwecken genutzt werden können\". Am Abend sagte Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel in einer Ansprache, \"dass es keine Urlaubsreise ins In- und auch keine ins Ausland geben soll\".\nAktuell zählt das Robert Koch-Institut folgende Länder bzw. Gebiete zu den Risikogebieten: Italien, Iran, in China: Provinz Hubei, in Südkorea: Provinz Gyeongsangbuk-do, in Frankreich: Region Grand Est (inklusive Elsass, Lothringen und Champagne-Ardenne), in Österreich: Bundesland Tirol, in Spanien: Madrid, in den USA: die Bundesstaaten Kalifornien, Washington und New York.\nDie zurzeit wichtigere Frage lautet: Sollte ich überhaupt noch reisen? Der Krisenstab der Bundesregierung gibt darauf eine eindeutige Antwort, indem er von allen nicht notwendigen Reisen ins Ausland abrät. Der Grund: Wegen der Maßnahmen gegen das Coronavirus steigt für Reisende das Risiko, nicht mehr ohne Weiteres nach Deutschland zurückkehren zu können. Zudem sei kurzfristig mit weiteren drastischen Einschränkungen des Luft- und Reiseverkehrs zu rechnen, schreibt das Auswärtige Amt.\nUm die Ausbreitung des neuen Virus zu verlangsamen, haben viele Regierungen weltweit Einreisebeschränkungen beschlossen. So hat etwa Polen seine Grenzen für Ausländer geschlossen, internationale Flug- und Zugverbindungen wurden ausgesetzt. Die USA haben alle Einreisen aus Europa für einen Zeitraum von 30 Tagen untersagt. Das Einreiseverbot für Europäer gilt, wenn sich diese innerhalb eines Zeitraums von 14 Tagen vor der Einreise in die USA in Deutschland oder einem anderen Land im Schengenraum aufgehalten haben.\nAndere Länder, wie etwa Russland oder Rumänien, verpflichten Einreisende aus Deutschland zu einer 14-tägigen Quarantäne. Weitere Staaten, darunter Indien, haben sämtliche bereits ausgestellte Visa für deutsche Staatsangehörige für ungültig erklärt. Für Thailand dagegen gilt (noch) kein harter Einreisestopp.\nDie Einreisebestimmungen Ihres Reiselands können sich derzeit auch spontan ändern. Informieren Sie sich also unbedingt kurzfristig, zum Beispiel beim Auswärtigen Amt, bei der jeweiligen Landesvertretung in Deutschland oder bei der Deutschen Botschaft in Ihrem Reiseland. Auch ist zu empfehlen, sich stets über den aktuellen Status gebuchter Flüge bei den Airlines zu informieren.\nDas ist nicht\neinheitlich geregelt. Die Verträge einiger Anbieter beinhalten einen\nPandemie-Ausschluss. Das heißt, die Versicherung muss nicht bezahlen, wenn sich ein Kunde während einer Pandemie mit dem entsprechenden Erreger infiziert. Manche Anbieter sehen von dieser Möglichkeit aber aus Kulanz ab.\nDerzeit prüfen Versicherer, ob ihr Schutz weiter gilt, wenn Kunden in\nein Land reisen, das vom Robert Koch-Institut als Risikogebiet eingestuft wurde.\nDie Gültigkeit einiger Auslandskrankenversicherungen könnte dementsprechend noch eingeschränkt werden. Viele Versicherer veröffentlichen inzwischen FAQs mit weiteren Informationen auf ihrer Webseite.\nAußenminister Heiko Maas (SPD) hat eine Rückholaktion für Tausende Deutsche gestartet, die wegen Reisebeschränkungen in der Corona-Krise im Ausland festsitzen. Die meisten Deutschen, etwa 4.000 bis 5.000 Personen, befinden sich laut Auswärtigem Amt in Marokko. Die Bundeswehr komme bei den Rückführungen derzeit nicht zum Einsatz, da genügend Flugzeuge etwa von Lufthansa zur Verfügung stehen würden. Diese würden im Auftrag der Regierung zum Einsatz kommen.\nDas Auswärtige Amt hat formell eine weltweite Reisewarnung für touristische Reisen ausgegeben.\nBei der Deutschen Bahn kann man Tickets gegen Gutscheine tauschen – und zwar auch, wenn es sich um sogenannte Sparpreise oder Super Sparpreise handelt. Eine Gebühr fällt dafür nicht an. Das gilt für Fahrkarten, die vor dem 13. März gekauft wurden und bei denen der Reisetag zwischen dem 13. März und dem 30. April liegt. Dafür hat die Bahn ein Onlineformular erstellt. Der Antrag wird auch noch nach dem Reisetag angenommen. Eine andere Möglichkeit ist, diese Tickets flexibel bis zum 30. Juni an einem anderen Tag zu nutzen. Die Zugbindung ist aufgehoben. Nur City-Tickets gelten dann nicht mehr.\nDer deutsche Marktfüher Flixbus stellt den Betrieb ab Mittwoch ein. Das teilte das Unternehmen in München mit. Betroffen sind alle nationalen sowie grenzüberschreitenden Verbindungen von und nach Deutschland. Betroffene Fahrgäste würden über die Busausfälle informiert, hieß es. Sie würden einen Gutschein über den gesamten Ticketpreis bekommen. Auch das Unternehmen Blablabus stellt den Betrieb ab Mittwochmorgen ein.\nAm Montag vergangener Woche erklärte der Ministerpräsident Giuseppe Conte ganz Italien zur Sperrzone. Damit sind Reisen innerhalb des Landes generell untersagt – Ausnahmen seien aber möglich. Genau wie die schon zuvor für Norditalien verhängten Maßnahmen sollen die Restriktionen zunächst bis zum 3. April gelten. Conte erklärte: \"Unsere Gewohnheiten müssen sich ändern, jetzt. Wir alle müssen etwas aufgeben für das Wohl Italiens.\"\nSeit Donnerstag bleiben bis auf Supermärkte und Apotheken sämtliche Geschäfte geschlossen. Dazu zählen auch Bars und Restaurants sowie Theater und Museen.\nDie Bundesregierung rät von allen nicht erforderlichen Reisen nach Italien ab – nachdem das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) das ganze Land als Risikogebiet eingestuft hatte. Das Auswärtige Amt aktualisierte inzwischen seine Reisehinweise. Zuvor galten die Hinweise nur für besonders stark betroffene Regionen im Norden des Landes.\nDas Auswärtige Amt weist darauf hin, dass die Rückkehr an einen Wohnort sowohl innerhalb als auch außerhalb Italiens derzeit weiterhin möglich ist. Mit Kontrollen und Nachfragen von Sicherheits- und Ordnungskräften müsse aber gerechnet werden. Eine Selbsterklärung über die Notwendigkeit einer Fahrt innerhalb des Landes müsse ausgefüllt und mitgeführt werden.\nLeider gibt es derzeit keine pauschale Antwort für alle Reisende. Nehmen Sie so früh wie möglich Kontakt zu Ihrem Reiseveranstalter auf. Dort erhalten sie Informationen, was Sie machen können, wenn sie Urlaub in Ländern mit Reisebeschränkungen gebucht haben. Üblicherweise ist eine kostenfreie Stornierung dann möglich, wenn eine Reisewarnung des Auswärtigen Amts vorliegt. Mit Bezug auf das neue Coronavirus gilt eine solche Warnung bislang nur für die chinesische Provinz Hubei.\nSie können häufig auch dann von Ihrer Buchung zurücktreten, wenn Sie mit erheblichen Änderungen Ihrer geplanten Reise rechnen müssen, schreibt die Verbraucherzentrale. Das gelte nicht nur für Einreiseverbote, sondern im Zweifel schon dann, wenn wesentliche Sehenswürdigkeiten nicht besichtigt werden können. Individualreisende wenden sich am besten direkt an die Fluggesellschaften, Bahn- oder Busunternehmen und an die bereits reservierten Unterkünfte beziehungsweise an die genutzten Buchungsportale.\n\"Wenn eine konkrete Gefahr durch außergewöhnliche Umstände besteht, können Sie kostenlos stornieren\", sagt der Hamburger Rechtsanwalt Oliver Matzek, Spezialist für Reiserecht. Als außergewöhnliche Umstände anerkannt sind Unwetter oder Streiks, aber auch medizinische Notlagen wie eine Epidemie. Um herauszufinden, ob für Ihr Reiseziel ein solcher außergewöhnlicher Umstand als Stornogrund infrage kommt, fragen Sie am besten direkt bei Ihrem Vertragspartner nach.\nWer aus Angst vor Ansteckung eine bereits gebuchte Reise absagen möchte, ohne dass konkrete Reisebeschränkungen vorliegen, kann sich unabhängig vom Coronavirus jederzeit auf die Stornierungsregeln berufen, die beim Vertragsabschluss vereinbart wurden.\nWenn Sie Ihre Reise nicht selbst stornieren, sondern beispielsweise die Fluggesellschaft Ihre Verbindung streicht, wird Ihr Ticketpreis üblicherweise komplett erstattet. Gleiches gilt, wenn eine ganze Pauschalreise abgesagt wird.\nDie meisten Reiserücktrittsversicherungen decken nur den Krankheitsfall vor Reiseantritt ab, nicht die Gefahr einer möglichen Ansteckung während der Reise. Die genauen Bestimmungen finden Sie in den Vertragsbedingungen Ihrer Versicherung. Grundsätzlich können Sie jederzeit vor dem ersten Tag Ihrer Reise noch eine Versicherung abschließen, allerdings mit einer entscheidenden Einschränkung: \"Im Moment des Vertragsschlusses darf der Versicherungsfall noch nicht eingetreten sein\", erklärt Rechtsanwalt Matzek. Bereits bestehende Gefahren kann man also nicht versichern. Das gilt auch für die Corona-Epidemie, was besonders wichtig ist, wenn Sie in Regionen reisen, die schon als Risikogebiet eingestuft wurden.\nRückreisende aus Italien, Österreich und der Schweiz werden gebeten, sich nach ihrer Rückkehr 14 Tage lang zu Hause aufzuhalten. Dies gilt unabhängig davon, ob ein konkreter Corona-Verdachtsfall vorliegt oder nicht.\nWer innerhalb von 14 Tagen nach der Rückkehr aus einem Risikogebiet Symptome entwickelt, die für das neue Coronavirus typisch sind, sollte den ärztlichen Bereitschaftsdienst anrufen, der bundesweit unter der Nummer 116117 zu erreichen ist. Zu den typischen Symptomen gehören Fieber, Husten und Atemnot, allerdings kann die vom Coronavirus ausgelöste Krankheit Covid-19 laut RKI individuell sehr unterschiedlich verlaufen. Wenn Sie den Verdacht hegen, sich angesteckt zu haben, bleiben Sie zu Hause und besuchen Sie nicht eigenständig eine Arztpraxis oder Notaufnahme, damit riskieren Sie im Zweifel die Ansteckung Ihrer Mitmenschen.\nDa es keine seriösen Vorhersagen darüber gibt, wie sich die Coronavirus-Epidemie weiterentwickelt, lässt sich diese Frage momentan nicht einfach beantworten. Viele Reiseveranstalter pausieren ihr Programm bis (zunächst) Ende April und lockern ihre Storno-Regeln.

Wenn Deutsche demnächst zum Skiurlaub in die Schweiz fahren, wird es in den Gondeln und Luxusgeschäften leerer sein als gewohnt. Denn die chinesischen Touristengruppen, die zuletzt immer dominanter im Straßenbild wurden, bleiben aus. Schuld ist das Coronavirus. Viele Flüge von und nach China sind zurzeit gestrichen, zwei Drittel der Übernachtungen von Chinesen in Europa wurden storniert, schätzt der europäische Tourismusverband Etoa. Was die Skifahrer vielleicht freut, sorgt die Hoteliers und Boutiquenbetreiber. Denn die Chinesen sind nicht nur eine stetig wachsende Reisegruppe, sondern auch eine wenig knausrige: Je Nacht geben sie beispielsweise in der Schweiz fast dreimal so viel aus wie deutsche Gäste.\nLänder mit viel Tourismus sind deshalb die ersten, deren Wirtschaft vom Coronavirus getroffen wird. Doch sie werden nicht die einzigen bleiben.\nDas Virus ist zu einer Gefahr für die Weltwirtschaft geworden. Das sieht man schon an den Reaktionen der Aktienmärkte. Die Kurse rauschten nicht nur in China nach dem dortigen Neujahrsfest runter. Neun Prozent Minus verzeichnete am Montag der Shanghai Composite Index. Und als in der Woche zuvor die chinesischen Börsen noch geschlossen waren, reagierten schon die internationalen Märkte. Der Deutsche Aktienindex Dax fiel vergangene Woche am Montag deutlich, erholte sich dann leicht, um am Donnerstag noch mal zu sinken. Insgesamt verlor er in der Woche 4,4 Prozent. Der Dow Jones in den Vereinigten Staaten fiel in derselben Woche um 3,5 Prozent. Auch Öl und Kupfer, deren Kurse immer schnell reagieren, wenn die Weltkonjunktur in Gefahr ist, gaben deutlich nach.\nAnleger neigen zwar zur Übertreibung, bilden aber ziemlich gut ab, was aktuell für die Zukunft erwartet wird. Und die Erwartung derzeit ist: Obacht, dieses Virus könnte ansteckend sein. Ansteckend für die Weltwirtschaft.\nDas liegt vor allem daran, dass es in China ausgebrochen ist, einem Land, das hochgradig verflochten ist mit dem Rest der Welt. Zum Beispiel über die Rohstoffe: 13,5 Prozent des Rohöls der Welt und fast die Hälfte des Rohstahls gingen letztes Jahr dorthin. 2002 lag der jeweilige Anteil erst rund halb so hoch. Auch im Konsum hat China eine Bedeutung gewonnen, die nicht unterschätzt werden sollte. Fast jedes dritte Smartphone wird heute in China verkauft und mehr als jedes dritte Auto.\nJe verflochtener andere Länder wiederum mit China und mit der Weltwirtschaft sind, desto gefährdeter sind sie, falls das Virus die chinesische Wirtschaft für längere Zeit lahmlegt. Deutschland ist enorm globalisiert, wie unter anderem der Exportüberschuss zeigt, der zuletzt wieder höher war als in allen anderen Ländern der Welt. Das drittwichtigste Exportland ist China. Gleichzeitig ist es das wichtigste Importland. Was einzelne Branchen angeht, ist insbesondere die deutsche Autoindustrie stark an China gebunden. Etwa jedes dritte Auto verkaufen BMW, Daimler und Co. dorthin, bei Volkswagen sind es sogar 40 Prozent.\nDie Abhängigkeit ist also groß. Doch kann das Virus tatsächlich so viel anrichten, dass es die gesamte deutsche Volkswirtschaft spürt?\nDer Weltwirtschaft kann es auf drei Wegen schaden. Erstens ganz direkt. Seit viele Menschen wegen der Gesundheitsgefahr zu Hause bleiben, seit Läden geschlossen bleiben, Fitnessstudios, Restaurants und teils ganze Fabriken, ist die Binnenwirtschaft Chinas kurzzeitig beinahe zum Stillstand gekommen. Ausländische Firmen spüren das. Entweder weil sie weniger in China verkaufen oder weil chinesische Touristen stornieren. Oder, wenn sie selbst in China produzieren, weil die Produktion ausfällt. Das kann, wenn der Höhepunkt der Ansteckung überschritten ist, schnell wieder vorbei sein.\nSchaden kann das Virus der Weltwirtschaft zweitens über das chinesische Wachstum. Dauert die Epidemie länger und senkt sie das Wachstum über einen längeren Zeitraum, wirkt das indirekt zurück auf Länder, die mit China verbunden sind. Denn in der Folge investieren die Firmen weniger in China. Und Länder, die Investitionsgüter produzieren – Deutschland ist hier stark –, werden getroffen.\nEnde 2019 meldeten die chinesischen Behörden der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO eine Häufung von Lungenentzündungen unklarer Ursache in der zentralchinesischen Stadt Wuhan. Bereits eine Woche später identifizierten chinesische Forscher ein neuartiges Virus als Ursache der Krankheitsfälle. Es gehört zur Gruppe der Coronaviren. Wenige Tage darauf veröffentlichte eine Gruppe um den Virologen Christian Drosten von der Berliner Charité den ersten diagnostischen Test für das neue Virus, das Forscher provisorisch 2019-nCoV nennen. Mit dem Test kann das Virus im Labor nachgewiesen werden. Als Quelle des Erregers vermuten die chinesischen Behörden einen Lebensmittelmarkt in Wuhan, auf dem neben Fisch und Meeresfrüchten auch exotische Tiere wie Schlangen verkauft wurden. Der Markt wurde geschlossen und desinfiziert.\nSowohl die Atemwegserkrankungen Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) als auch Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) werden von Coronaviren verursacht, die ihren Ursprung in Tieren haben. Während der Sars-Pandemie infizierten sich in den Jahren 2002 und 2003 etwa 8.000 Menschen, mehr als 750 starben. Mit dem Mers-Virus haben sich seit seiner Entdeckung 2012 bis zum Jahresende 2019 etwa 2.500 Menschen angesteckt, jeder Dritte ist daran gestorben. Insgesamt gibt es aber mehrere Hundert Arten von Coronaviren. Viele von ihnen betreffen die Atemwege und können zum Beispiel Erkältungen verursachen.\nIn China sind inzwischen mehrere Tausend Personen erkrankt, einige von ihnen – die meisten wohl mit Vorerkrankungen – sind an einer Lungenentzündung infolge des Virus gestorben. Die ersten Infektionsfälle außerhalb Chinas wurden in Thailand, Japan und Südkorea bekannt. Es handelt sich um Reisende, die vorher in Wuhan gewesen waren. Am 21. Januar meldeten US-Behörden die erste Infektion bei einem Touristen, der aus Wuhan zurückkam, am 24. Januar wurden die ersten Fälle in Frankreich bekannt. Mittlerweile wurden auch erste Fälle in Deutschland bestätigt. Typische Zeichen einer Infektion sind Fieber, Husten und Atembeschwerden. Das Virus kann eine Lungenentzündung verursachen, die tödlich enden kann. Da es sich um eine virale Krankheit handelt, helfen Antibiotika nicht.\nInzwischen ist klar, dass das Virus von Mensch zu Mensch übertragen werden kann. Chinesische Behörden haben mehrere solcher Übertragungen bestätigt, nachdem auch etwa ein Dutzend Fälle bei medizinischem Personal bekannt wurden. Medizinerinnen und Mediziner gehen davon aus, dass das Virus vor allem über Tröpfcheninfektion übertragen wird. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation rechnet, wie sie am 24. Januar mitteilte, momentan damit, dass ein Infizierter im Schnitt 1,4 bis 2,5 andere Menschen ansteckt. Bewahrheiten sich diese Zahlen, ist das Virus weniger ansteckend als Sars und auch die Virusgrippe. Die WHO empfiehlt generelle Hygieneregeln zu beachten: Man solle sich häufig die Hände waschen und engen Kontakt zu Personen mit Atemwegserkrankungen und wilden Tieren meiden.\nDas lässt sich noch nicht mit Sicherheit sagen. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation teilte am 28. Januar mit, dass ungefähr ein Fünftel der gemeldeten Fälle durch das Virus schwer krank werde, im Zweifelsfall also intensivmedizinisch behandelt werden muss. Berichten zufolge handelte es sich bei den ersten Todesopfern um Patienten, die teils schwere Vorerkrankungen hatten. Auch bei anderen Infektionskrankheiten sind Menschen mit Vorerkrankungen besonders gefährdet – etwa bei der Grippe. Coronaviren sind dafür bekannt, dass sie mutieren, also ihr Erbgut verändern können. Das kann dazu führen, dass sie im Laufe eines Ausbruchs gefährlicher für Menschen werden – aber auch zum genauen Gegenteil. Das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) erwartet zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt keine ähnlich hohe Mortalität wie beim Ausbruch von Sars.\nDer dritte Weg ist der unwahrscheinlichste, aber gefährlichste: eine Panik. Entwickelt sich die Epidemie in China oder sogar weltweit so dramatisch, dass das Vertrauen der Anleger sinkt und Kurse weltweit abstürzen, kann das in eine Finanzkrise münden. Das wird derzeit auch deshalb debattiert, weil viele Ökonomen die Lage der Weltwirtschaft ohnehin als fragil empfinden. Der Amerikaner Kenneth Rogoff etwa warnt schon seit Längerem davor, dass die Risiken für eine erneute Finanzkrise weltweit steigen. Im Januar diskutierten prominente Wirtschaftswissenschaftler auf dem Jahrestreffen der American Economic Association über mögliche Auslöser. Das Virus war damals noch kein Thema, wohl aber China. Das Land steht unter Beobachtung, da es jahrelang rasant gewachsen ist, nun aber schon seit Längerem schwächelt. Der Immobilienboom hat aus Sicht mancher Beobachter eine gefährliche Dimension angenommen, die Verschuldung ebenfalls. Manchmal braucht es nur einen Auslöser, damit die ganze Situation kippt. Zumal die Notenbanken weltweit nicht mehr so stark sind wie einst, seit sie viel Pulver in der Finanzkrise verschossen haben.\nAber kann ein Virus wirklich ein Auslöser für solch eine dramatische Krise sein? Der Blick zurück könnte Anlass zur Entwarnung sein. Der Ausbruch der Infektionskrankheit Sars im Jahr 2003, der Tsunami in Thailand und Indonesien (2004, 230.000 Todesopfer) oder die Reaktorkatastrophe in Fukushima (2011) hatten ökonomisch begrenzte Folgen. Schon wenige Quartale nach der Katastrophe lief die Wirtschaft wieder auf vollen Touren.\nDoch der Vergleich mit diesen Ereignissen hat seine Tücken. Naturkatastrophen, bei denen Häuser, Fabriken und Straßen zerstört werden, führen nach kurzer Zeit oft zu einer besonderen Wachstumsphase. Schlicht weil die Schäden repariert werden. Solch eine Sonderkonjunktur ist nach einer Erkrankungswelle aber nicht zu erwarten. Denn es gibt keine Häuser oder Straßen aufzubauen.\nDie Parallelen zur Sars-Epidemie sind ebenfalls begrenzt. \"Man sollte nicht den Fehler begehen, sich unreflektiert an dieser Krise zu orientieren\", sagt Cyrus de la Rubia, Chefvolkswirt der Hamburg Commercial Bank. Damals nämlich stiegen die Kurse just wieder, als die Weltgesundheitsorganisation den globalen Gesundheitsnotstand ausrief. Ja, sie setzten laut de la Rubia sogar zu einer \"erstaunlichen Rallye\" an. Erstens sind nun aber die gesundheitlichen Folgen andere. Schon jetzt, nach wenigen Wochen, zählt China mehr Tote durch den neuen Erreger als während des gesamten Sars-Ausbruchs, der mehrere Monate dauerte. Zweiten sind die ökonomischen Bedingungen grundverschieden. Im Jahr 2003 war China zwar eine aufstrebende Wirtschaftsmacht, aber seine Bedeutung für den Welthandel war noch deutlich geringer als heute. Vor 17 Jahren stammten weniger als fünf Prozent der globalen Wirtschaftsleistung aus chinesischen Waren und Dienstleistungen, heute sind es 19 Prozent. Auch als Abnehmer von Exporten ist China wichtiger geworden. Ein Wirtschaftseinbruch in China dürfte also international stärker zu spüren sein als früher.\nWie stark genau die deutsche Wirtschaft leiden könnte, das versucht Timo Wollmershäuser abzuschätzen. Er leitet die Konjunkturabteilung des Ifo-Instituts in München. Dafür nutzt er ein Softwareprogramm mit Hunderten Gleichungen, in dem Daten über wirtschaftliche Verflechtungen und bisher beobachtete Wechselwirkungen stecken: das Ifo-Konjunkturmodell. In dieses Programm hat Wollmershäuser die Daten für ein Szenario eingegeben, in dem die Wirtschaftsleistung Chinas um ein Prozent nachlässt. So stark war der Rückgang durch Sars.\nDie wirtschaftlichen Folgen, die das Coronavirus für Deutschland hätte, wären demnach überschaubar: Das Wachstum hierzulande ginge in diesem Fall nur um 0,05 Prozent zurück. \"Wenn die aktuelle Epidemie das chinesische Wirtschaftswachstum doppelt so stark dämpft, wie es bei Sars der Fall war, dürfte es in Deutschland um etwa 0,1 Prozent niedriger ausfallen.\" Die Folgen wären also stärker als früher, für die gesamte Volkswirtschaft aber kein Drama.\nDie Auswirkungen könnten deshalb so glimpflich ausfallen, weil eine Epidemie zunächst vor allem die Konsumnachfrage dämpft: Reisen, Restaurantbesuche, Einkäufe. Vieles davon fällt jetzt weg und wird nicht nachgeholt. \"Für Deutschland ist es aber praktisch irrelevant, wenn der Konsum in China zurückgeht\", sagt Wollmershäuser. \"Wir liefern kaum Konsumgüter dorthin.\" Erst wenn die Chinesen weniger Maschinen und weniger Autos bestellen – der zweite Weg, wie das Virus der Wirtschaft schaden kann –, wäre das für hiesige Exporte spürbar. Oft werden solche großen Anschaffungen aber in einer Krise nur aufgeschoben und später nachgeholt.\nErnster könnten die Folgen sein, wenn die Lieferketten gestört werden. Wenn also China als Lieferant von Produkten für die hiesige Industrie länger ausfällt. Etwa ein Zehntel aller aus dem Ausland importierten Vorprodukte und Investitionsgüter beziehen deutsche Firmen aus China. Noch ist aber nicht absehbar, wieweit tatsächlich Lieferengpässe entstehen.\nDas ist auch deshalb schwer zu sagen, weil sich schon in China selbst die Fachleute schwertun, die wirtschaftlichen Folgen abzuschätzen. Straßen und Geschäfte sind mittlerweile nicht nur in Wuhan leer, wo die Infektion begann, sondern auch in anderen großen Metropolen. Viele Firmen haben – teils auf Anordnung der lokalen Behörden, teils aufgrund eigener Entscheidung – ihre Büros noch geschlossen. In manchen Regionen, etwa in Shanghai, sollen die Arbeitnehmer noch bis zum 9. Februar zu Hause bleiben, in anderen, wie etwa Peking, endete die behördlich verlängerte Ferienzeit Anfang dieser Woche. \"Wahrscheinlich wird man erst Anfang nächster Woche absehen können, inwieweit die Belegschaften in den Firmen wieder arbeiten können und inwieweit es zu Problemen in den Lieferketten kommt\", sagt Jens Hildebrandt, Geschäftsführer der Deutschen Handelskammer in Peking. Hildebrandt selbst arbeitet derzeit von zu Hause aus.\nDazu kommt: Die meisten Prognosen beruhen noch auf der Annahme, das neue Virus rufe eine regional und zeitlich beschränkte Krise hervor. Wenn sich das nicht bewahrheiten sollte, wenn also der Stillstand in China länger dauert oder Deutschland stärker von dem Virus befallen wird, dann lässt sich der wirtschaftliche Schaden viel schwerer vorhersagen.\nLinks zu diesen und weiteren Quellen finden Sie unter zeit.de/wq/2020-07.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus: From US to India, how nations are tackling economic fallout. Policymakers and government leaders have taken a range of approaches to deal with the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Here is a list of how some of the world's biggest economies and economic blocs have reacted.\nUNITED STATES\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday instructed the U.S. Treasury Department to defer tax payments without interest or penalties for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted, saying it would provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy.\nTrump also said he was ordering the Small Business Administration to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus by providing low-interest loans to small businesses in affected states and territories, effective immediately. And he suspended all travel from Europe, with a few exceptions, to the United States for 30 days starting on Friday.\nEarlier, Trump signed a $8.3 billion emergency spending bill to combat the spread of the virus and develop vaccines for the highly contagious disease.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by half a percentage point in its first emergency rate move since the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Investors expect more cuts in the weeks ahead.\nCHINA\nChina said it had earmarked 110.5 billion yuan ($15.9 billion) to fight the epidemic.\nBeijing has ramped up funding support for virus-hit regions and the country's central bank has cut several of its key rates, including the benchmark lending rate, and has urged banks to give cheap loans and payment relief to exposed companies.\nChina will modify the environmental supervision of companies to help the resumption of production disrupted by the coronavirus epidemic, giving firms more time to rectify environmental problems.\nJAPAN\nJapan unveiled a second package of measures worth about $4 billion in spending to cope with the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak, focusing on support to small and mid-sized firms, as concerns mount about risks to the fragile economy.\nSeparately, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has pledged to pump more liquidity into markets and step up asset buying.\nJapan's central bank may also take steps to ensure companies hit by the coronavirus outbreak do not face a financial squeeze before the end of the current fiscal year in March, according to sources familiar with the central bank's thinking.\nEUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK\nThe ECB, the central bank of the euro zone, has so far avoided cutting interest rates. Policymakers did hold an unscheduled meeting on March 3 but it was to discuss operational responses to coronavirus, such as whether to hold events and staff shortages, rather than any policy response, sources close to the matter said.\nThe ECB has asked euro zone banks to review their business continuity plans and the actions they can take to prepare for and minimize the potential adverse effects of the coronavirus, a letter seen by Reuters shows.\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION\nEuropean Union leaders have so far failed to agree radical measures to tackle the crisis. The head of the bloc's executive Ursula von der Leyen said the European Commission will set up a joint investment fund with firepower of 25 billion euros ($28 billion) from existing resources to cushion the blow to vulnerable sectors of the bloc's economies.\nGERMANY\nGermany's centre-left coalition agreed to increase public investments by 12.4 billion euros by 2024 and to make it easier for companies to claim subsidies to support workers on reduced working hours to counter the effects of the coronavirus epidemic.\nChancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives are split over whether Germany should rush out a fiscal stimulus package to counter any impact of the coronavirus on Europe's largest economy.\nBudget experts estimate the government has the fiscal room for additional measures worth at least 17 billion euros ($18.9 billion). Some officials say that Berlin could even put together a stimulus package worth up to 50 billion euros, without ditching the government's policy of no new debt.\nBRITAIN\nBritain launched a 30 billion-pound ($39 billion) economic stimulus plan just hours after the Bank of England slashed interest rates, a double-barrelled package aimed at warding off the risk of a coronavirus recession.\nThe Bank of England cut interest rates by half a percentage point and offered banks cheaper funding and a reduction in capital buffers in an emergency move to bolster Britain's economy against disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak.\nFRANCE\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Marie has said that Europe needs to be ready to use fiscal stimulus to deal with the impact of the coronavirus.\nThe government is allowing companies to suspend payments of some social charges and taxes, and is activating state-subsidised short-time work schemes. It has ordered the Bpifrance state investment bank to guarantee loans needed to overcome short-term cashflow problems.\nParis has also allowed companies to declare force majeure due to the outbreak if they cannot honor a contract with the public sector, and is putting pressure on big companies to show similar leniency with subcontractors.\nINDIA\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plans to infuse fresh cash liquidity into the system through a second round of long-term repo operations (LTRO), government officials told Reuters, amid fears that the coronavirus outbreak will derail any revival of economic growth. One official said the RBI might inject as much as 1 trillion rupees ($13.6 billion) in the round that will begin as early as April.\nThe RBI has said it stands ready to act to maintain market confidence and preserve financial stability.\nThe government is, meanwhile, pushing state-run banks to approve new loans amounting to 500-600 billion rupees by the end of March, according to government sources.\nITALY\nItaly has doubled the amount it plans to spend on tackling its coronavirus outbreak to 7.5 billion euros ($8.4 billion) and is raising this year's deficit goal to 2.5% of national output from the current 2.2% target.\nPayments on mortgages will be suspended across the whole of Italy and Italy's banking lobby ABI said lenders would offer debt moratoriums to small firms and households grappling with the economic fallout from the virus.\nCANADA\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau said on March 9 that the government was \"looking at taking some initiatives this week,\" as Canada reported its first coronavirus death, with a steep decline in oil prices expected to hit the world's fourth-largest crude producer hard.\nThe Bank of Canada lowered its benchmark overnight rate to 1.25% from 1.75% in response to the epidemic, prompting money markets to price in a better-than-even chance of another reduction next month. The last time it cut by 50 basis points was in 2009 during the financial crisis.\nSOUTH KOREA\nThe government announced a stimulus package of 11.7 trillion won ($9.8 billion) to cushion the impact of the largest outbreak of coronavirus outside China.\nFinance Minister Hong Nam-ki said the supplementary budget, subject to parliamentary approval, would channel money to the health system, childcare, and outdoor markets. An additional 10.3 trillion won in treasury bonds will be issued this year to fund the extra budget.\nSeoul has also dramatically tightened rules on short-selling for three months. Starting March 11, stocks with a sudden and abnormal increase in short-selling transactions will be suspended from further short-selling for 10 days.\n"}, {"content": "CORRECTED-Thailand finds second case of new Chinese virus, says no outbreak.

BEIJING (AP) — Scientists in the city at the centre of China’s virus outbreak have applied to patent a drug made by United States (US) company Gilead Science Inc to treat the disease, possibly fuelling conflict over technology policy that helped trigger Washington’s tariff war with Beijing.The government-run Wuhan Institute of Virology said this week it applied for the patent in January along with a military laboratory. An institute statement acknowledged there are “intellectual property barriers” but said it acted to “protect national interests”.Granting its own scientists a patent might give the Chinese government leverage in negotiations over paying for the drug. But it also might fuel complaints Beijing abuses its regulatory system to pressure foreign companies to hand over valuable technology.Yesterday, the official Xinhua News Agency said clinical trials of the drug, remdesivir, were due to start.Gilead, headquartered in Foster City, California, said it applied in 2016 for a Chinese patent on use of remdesivir against coronaviruses and is waiting for a decision. The coronavirus family includes the novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, blamed for the outbreak in Wuhan.“Gilead has no influence over whether a patent office issues a patent to the Chinese researchers,” said a company spokesman, Ryan McKeel. “Their application has been filed more than three years after Gilead’s filing and will be considered in view of what is already known about the compound and pending patent applications.”The institute said its application was filed on January 21. Two days later, Chinese authorities suspended most access to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. That lockdown has expanded to surrounding cities and some in other provinces, isolating a total of about 60 million people in the most sweeping anti-disease measures ever imposed.China has the right under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules to declare an emergency and compel a company to licence a patent to protect the public.It would be required to pay a license fee that is deemed fair market value.The government might be able to avoid that fee if the patent were granted to the Wuhan institute, part of the elite Chinese Academy of Sciences.The institute said it applied for a “use patent” that specifies the Wuhan virus as the drug’s target. Gilead’s patent application, filed before the virus was identified, cites only the overall family of coronaviruses.The Chinese researchers made their patent application “from the perspective of protecting national interests,” said the institute’s statement.“If relevant foreign companies plan to contribute to China’s epidemic prevention and control, we both agree that if the state needs it, we will not require enforcement of rights given by the patent,” it said.Gilead said last week it was working with US and Chinese health authorities on studying remdesivir. The company said it has provided the drug for emergency use in a small number of patients with the Wuhan virus “in the absence of any approved treatment options”.\n"}, {"content": "First case of Malaysian positive for coronavirus.

By Mohd Fharkhan Abdul GhaparKUALA LUMPUR, Jan 30  -- Malaysia has been more prepared and proactive, and has also acted faster in containing the novel coronavirus compared to previous times when faced with dangerous infections such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), the Nipah virus and Ebola.Infectious disease specialist Datuk Dr Christopher K.C. Lee told Bernama yesterday that its experience in containing these past infectious diseases had made Malaysia more prepared to deal with such situations, and this included having more thermal scanners which have been placed at all entry points into the country, as well as its actions in isolating coronavirus cases and placing suspected cases under quarantine.He said swift measures such as these were important in reducing potential local transmissions of the virus in the country.\"Compared to SARS in 2002, when we took weeks to trace the infections, now we have managed to do so much earlier due to our experience, expertise and the technology employed.\"We are now in a containment phase, to prevent any local transmission. The seven cases that have been detected were not infected in Malaysia but overseas, and imported into the country. It is important that we prevent the infections from spreading within the country,\" Dr Lee explained.The new coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, was first detected in December, in Wuhan, China, causing pneumonia and symptoms such as fever, cough and breathing difficulties. As of last night, Malaysia had seven confirmed cases.The specialist added that apart from thermal scanners, the dissemination of information to every tourist entering Malaysia, particularly tourists from infected areas, was also important.\"They (tourists) need to be given information about the virus and actions needed such as seeking treatment at specific hospitals if they do not feel well.\"This is important because when they entered Malaysia, they may not have had a fever or other symptoms but may have fallen ill several days later,\" Dr Lee stressed.The specialist who is experienced in handling SARS, Nipah virus and Ebola cases, noted that the outbreak of the virus in affected areas such as Wuhan, had occurred at a faster rate compared to other infectious diseases, and the world still had insufficient data on the new virus.The spread of the virus had been exacerbated by the increased movement of people within and out of China in conjunction with the Chinese New Year celebrations. “It makes things a bit complicated,” he said.Asked about claims that the coronavirus could be spread through its presence on the surface of goods imported from China, Dr Lee said the possibility of such an occurrence was low because many viruses could only last within a particular environment for a period ranging from a few hours to a few days, and this would be dependent on the context.\"Although we do not have enough information on the coronavirus, we believe it is like SARS and influenza which won’t last long in the environment,\" he added. -- BERNAMA "}, {"content": "Coronavirus India cases and deaths: Best or worst, this online epidemic calculator shows Covid-19 projections. What is going to be the future of Covid-19 in India? For how long coronavirus will infect people here? How many people are going to fall sick with Covid-19 in India? And how many people may die of Covid-19 here? No one has a sure answer to these questions. Possibly because no one can have an answer to these questions. But in case you are curious there is an online tool created by a machine learning expert that shows the course Covid-19 pandemic may take in India. It is a simple tool, but one based on SEIR model that scientists and public health experts use to predict epidemic in a given region.\nThe tool has been created by Gabriel Goh, a machine learning researcher.\nThere is nothing official about the tool but during a time when the information from government experts may not be coming or coming fast enough it can shed some clarity on what Covid-19 can do to India. Depending on what measures the country takes, and what impact these measures have on Covid-19 infections in India, coronavirus may end up killing around 1000 people to 5 million people in India, according to the Epidemic Calculator. Why such gap between these two numbers?\nAccording to the Epidemic Calculator, it all depends on flattening the curve, bringing down R0 the rate at which infections spread and at what stage the lockdown was enforced and ordered.\nAt the time of writing, the coronavirus disease of 2019 remains a global health crisis of grave and uncertain magnitude. To the non-expert (such as myself), contextualizing the numbers, forecasts and epidemiological parameters described in the media and literature can be challenging. I created this calculator as an attempt to address this gap in understanding, notes Goh. This calculator implements a classical infectious disease model -- SEIR (Susceptible > Exposed > Infected > Removed) -- an idealized model of spread still used in frontlines of research.\nBy default the tool already has the relevant data, based on the research reports that have come out on Covid-19 from China and other countries so far, in the required fields. To see how Covid-19 will progress in India on the basis of this available data about coronavirus, and how it infects people, how many it kills, for how long it keeps people sick, all you need to do is change the population of the region to India’s population.\nHere are some projections this tool gives as far Covid-19 and its future progression in India is concerned:\nCovid-19 in India with default data\nWith default data, which considers the infection rate R0 of 2.2 it means a coronavirus patient is likely to infect at least two more people the coronavirus Epidemic Calculator indicates that in a year the disease will infect a little over 1 million people in India. Of these, it will kill little over 20,000 people. While you look at these numbers, there are a few important bits to remember.\n-- By default the Epidemic Calculator assumes that on the 100th day after the first reported case the government has forced the region or country into a full lockdown.\n-- The lockdown or intervention in some other way, brings down the R0 to less than 1. This is very important.\n-- If the lockdown or intervention has brought the R0 lower earlier, say just 50 days after the first case was reported, the total number of cases will be significantly less and number of fatalities exponentially lower.\n-- It is also important to remember that by default the Epidemic Calculator considers fatality rate for Covid-19 as 2 per cent. In China, it has been slightly more. In South Korea and Germany it is significantly less. In Italy and Spain, it is alarmingly high, particularly in Italy where it is above 8 per cent. If you consider other figures for India depending on which one you do the covid-19 picture will change.\nThe covid-19 case fatality rate for India is something neither experts nor Epidemic Calculator can predict. The global fatality rate for swine flu is less than 0.1 per cent. But in India, in the previous swine flu epidemics, the death rate has been close to 6 per cent. For Covid-19 only time will tell what is the fatality rate in India.\nCovid-19 in India a best case scenario\nSo, what is the best case scenario for covid-19 in India. If everything works well in India, if government mounts a good response, and death rate is not above 2 per cent, health care system holds up, quarantine is effective, then covid-19 may end up infecting a little above 15,000 people. This also takes into account the fact that in India the first case was detected on January 30 and the lockdown was ordered on March 24. Assuming that the coronavirus became infectious in India a few days before the first patient was detected, we can say that the country mounted effective response on around Day 65 of the disease. This can potentially limit number of Ccovid-19 cases in India to around 15,000 and deaths to around 300. Let's hope this is the case.\nCovid-19 in India worst case scenario\nNow, take the worst case scenario. This is the one where the data that we have so far from the government is not accurate, the quarantine is not effective, the health system is not ready and will not be able to hold up well, that the disease is spreading in India undetected for far longer even though the first case was only found on January 30. In this case, also assume that India’s poor health system will not be able to cope up with Covid-19 when cases start to rise and let’s move the case fatality rate to 4 per cent, which is still significantly lower than what Covid-19 is showing in Italy and Spain but is higher than the global rate. Let’s also assume that the quarantine doesn’t bring down the R0 much. May be a half per cent or so but not enough to flatten the curve in one year.\nIn this case, given that population of India is little over 1.3 billion, we may end up seeing around 180 million infected in the country this year and little over 5 million dead.\nThis is all projection\nIt’s important to note that Covid-19 epidemic calculator is a tool that creates projections on the basis of data you feed into it. And as far as Covid-19 and novel coronavirus are concerned, right now not enough data, and not accurate enough data, is available. Everything is an approximation. What is the real fatality rate of Covid-19? Different countries are showing different numbers and they are all over the place, with extremely huge gaps between them. How quickly and how widely this is R0 that Covid-19 spreads? Again, we don’t know the exact number. Some studies say it is 4. Some say it is 2. Some even say that it is 6.\nThen there are other unknowns. Can Covid-19 re-infect people who were sick with it and then got better? We don’t know for sure. Does temperature India is a very hot country and dry air summer is coming in parts of India affect this coronavirus? And if it does, how much? We don’t know for sure. There are many more factors, like real world conditions. How long Covid-19 patients take to recover? For how long they are infectious? For how long they have to be in a hospital? For how long a country can care for its ICU patients? These are the figures that government experts and policy makers probably know. An online epidemic calculator doesn’t. So if you are giving the online epidemic calculator created by Gabriel Goh a spin, keep this in mind.\n"}, {"content": "China prohíbe comerciar con animales salvajes por el coronavirus de Wuhan. Bastaba con utilizar algunas palabras clave: “caza”, “sabor salvaje”, o “totalmente natural”. En algunas plataformas de comercio electrónico chino más populares hasta ahora era posible encontrar, indagando un poco, las carnes más exóticas. Como la civeta, el felino que sirvió de transmisor a los seres humanos del virus causante del SARS en 2003, a 350 yuanes (46 euros) el kilo. O pavo real. O salamandras gigantes. Ya no es tan fácil, al menos por un tiempo. A consecuencia del nuevo coronavirus de Wuhan, transmitido a los seres humanos por un animal vendido en uno de los mercados de esa ciudad, el Gobierno chino acaba de prohibir —aunque de momento, solo provisionalmente— el comercio y transporte de especies salvajes.\nLa orden conjunta emitida por tres entidades oficiales, entre ellas el Ministerio de Agricultura prohíbe cualquier tipo de comercio con estos animales, vivos o muertos, en cualquier plataforma, aunque menciona específicamente el comercio electrónico, restaurantes, supermercados o mercados. Las autoridades locales aumentarán las inspecciones y los castigos a quienes violen la prohibición serán “severos”. Las granjas de crianza de estos animales quedarán en cuarentena.\n“Los consumidores deben entender totalmente los riesgos para la salud de comer animales salvajes, han de permanecer alejados del sabor salvaje y comer sano”, precisa la norma.\nEl paso se ha dado después de que los científicos trazaran el origen del nuevo coronavirus, que ha causado la muerte de al menos 56 personas e infectado a más de 2.000 solo en China —y a más de una treintena en el resto del mundo— a un mercado en la ciudad de Wuhan, el epicentro de la infección. Aunque teóricamente el mercado Huanan —hoy cerrado a cal y canto— se dedicaba a la venta de mariscos y pescados, en su interior también se vendían todo tipo de animales enjaulados. Una lista de precios que ha circulado por redes sociales incluía un centenar de especies, desde cachorros de lobo a erizos o carne de camello. También marmotas, zorros o monos. O serpientes, ratones, gatos y perros.\nLos científicos no han conseguido identificar con seguridad la especie, pero sí han determinado que el coronavirus 2019-nCoV pasó a los humanos a través de un animal. Un grupo de científicos chinos ha publicado que probablemente fuera una serpiente; otros consideran que pudo ser un murciélago.\nUna situación idéntica a la que desencadenó la epidemia de SARS en 2003: los científicos determinaron que el transmisor de aquel coronavirus —emparentado con el de Wuhan— había sido la carne de civeta vendida en un mercado de Cantón. Aquel foco acabó infectando a 8.422 personas y causando la muerte a casi 800.\nEntonces, como ahora, se prohibió el comercio con animales salvajes. Pero, como ahora, de modo temporal. También disminuyó el interés en el consumo de esas carnes. Pero de modo temporal.\nChina sigue siendo un voraz consumidor de productos de animales salvajes, hasta el punto de acrecentar el riesgo de extinción de algunas especies. La demanda, bien como alimento o bien para su uso en medicina tradicional, ha crecido en paralelo con la prosperidad del país. Entre ciertos sectores, comer carnes cuanto más exóticas y difíciles de obtener sean es una manera de exhibir posición social. En otros casos, como el consumo de perro en el festival de Yulin, en el sur, comer esa carne es casi un acto de reivindicación de supuestas raíces nacionales.\nMercados como el de Wuhan no son raros. Una investigación que el periódico Beijing News publicaba la semana pasada encontraba que, un mes después de que se detectaran los primeros contagios en Wuhan, era posible aún encontrar en distintas provincias mercados dispuestos a vender, restaurantes dispuestos a preparar y, en foros de Internet, consumidores dispuestos a pagar lo que hiciera falta por este tipo de alimentos.\nEl problema en esos mercados no son solo las condiciones de higiene en que se mantiene a los animales, a menudo deficientes. También la dificultad de establecer la procedencia de los ejemplares. Aunque hay granjas que se dedican a la cría de estas especies con una licencia —se calcula que las de tigre acogen a unos 6.000 ejemplares—, los activistas denuncian que no es infrecuente que animales salvajes capturados acaben en alguna de ellas; o que las licencias se hayan obtenido de manera ilegal.\nAunque la virulencia del brote de coronavirus de Wuhan ha hecho que las voces contra esas prácticas se multipliquen. La semana pasada, 19 prominentes científicos enviaban una carta abierta al Gobierno para pedir la limitación de ese comercio. “No es solo importante para la conservación ecológica, sino por su gran importancia para controlar riesgos de salud pública”, alertaban. Los expertos piden también que se resuelvan los “vacíos legales” en los permisos para la domesticación y cría de animales salvajes, que permiten a los traficantes cazar animales en libertad y venderlos en el mercado a través de las granjas.\n“Los virus transmitidos por los animales son los patógenos humanos que aparecen con más frecuencia. Representan menos del 15% de todas las especies conocidas de patógenos humanos, pero más del 65% de patógenos descubiertos desde 1980”, apunta en un comunicado Christian Walzer, el director ejecutivo de la ONG Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), con sede en Nueva York.\nEl consumo de carne salvaje ha sido también objeto de un encendido debate en las redes chinas. “¡Si los humanos no viven en armonía con la naturaleza, desde luego que la naturaleza nos va a devolver el golpe!”, comentaba un usuario de Weibo, el Twitter chino.\nDe momento, la prohibición que llega de Pekín es solo temporal. La orden emitida este domingo precisa que durará solo “hasta que desaparezca la situación de epidemia en todo el país”.\nOrganizaciones como la WCS reclaman que se haga permanente. No solo en China, sino en todo el mundo. “Si esos mercados continúan, y el consumo humano de animales salvajes ilegal y sin reglar continúa, el público seguirá encarando mayores riesgos de nuevos virus, potencialmente más letales y fuentes de futuras pandemias”, sostiene Walzer.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus outbreak: Bangladesh suspends visa-on-arrival for Chinese nationals.

SINGAPORE — Banks here have unveiled packages to help companies and other customers with relief assistance to help tide them over the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. \n DBS and United Overseas Bank (UOB) said that the packages are aimed at helping small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as other customers. \n A third bank, OCBC, said that it is working closely with customers, whether individuals, SMEs or large corporates, to mitigate the fallout from the outbreak and to help them through this difficult period. \n Multinational bank Standard Chartered (Stanchart), which has operations in Singapore, said that individuals and small businesses here are facing unprecedented challenges in the near to long term, and it will introduce measures for clients who ask for financial assistance. \n DBS on Thursday (Feb 13) said that it conducted a poll of about 100 SME clients in early February to ascertain their top financial concerns and challenges during this time. \n The top concern for most companies, DBS added, was ensuring consistent cash flow to cover ongoing operating costs. \n To address these concerns, DBS said that it will provide liquidity relief packages to address the SMEs’ most urgent cash-flow needs. \n In particular, the bank said that it will provide a six-month principal repayment moratorium for SME property loans. \n It will also offer an extension of import facilities of up to 60 days to act as immediate cash-flow support for businesses coping with disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak. \n “These initiatives will be available upon application to customers with good repayment histories,” DBS said, adding that affected retail customers with good repayment histories can apply for a six-month principal repayment moratorium for mortgage loans. \n In its press statement on Thursday, OCBC said that it will offer targeted support measures to assist customers across its core markets affected by the outbreak — including mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia and Singapore. \n These measures include allowing customers to restructure their loans such as home mortgages and business loans, and providing a moratorium on principal repayment for loans such as home mortgages and business loans. \n Besides these, it will be extending the due date of the affected business’ trade finance bills as well as extending bridging loans in the form of more working capital financing to affected businesses. \n Join us on Telegram to get TODAY's top stories on mobile:  \n OCBC’s group chief executive officer Samuel Tsien said: “We will not put a cap on the help that we will extend to our customers. This Covid-19 outbreak is unfortunate and unanticipated. It is our banking and social responsibility to support our customers to help them overcome this market challenge which is not of their own making.”  \n He added: “We will help each of our customers as the case may justify and not on a first-come-first-serve basis. As we at OCBC put it, we must be ‘simply spot on’ on the assistance that our customers need.” \n Relief measures to be introduced by Stanchart include waivers of late payment fee and late interest charges for credit cards and personal loans, as well as late fee and default fee waivers for retail mortgages. \n Mr Dwaipayan Sadhu, Stanchart’s head of retail banking, said: “We understand that this can be a stressful time for everyone and we want to help our clients alleviate some financial burden in the short term, if they need it during this period.” \n On Wednesday, UOB announced that it has allocated S$3 billion to provide companies — especially SMEs — with relief assistance to address their near-term liquidity needs in the face of the likely economic fallout of the virus outbreak. \n The bank’s relief measures aim to enable affected companies — which have good track records and have been servicing their repayments promptly — to have more flexibility in their cash-flow management. \n In its press release, UOB said that the measures would include allowing affected businesses to rework their principal repayments and to service only their loan interest for up to one year; extending up to one year working capital financing of up to S$5 million; and offering financing liquidity against mortgage security. \n UOB’s deputy chairman and CEO Wee Ee Cheong said: “In these particularly trying times, the Government, businesses and communities are doing their very best to overcome this immediate challenge. We at UOB want to play our part in our commitment to caring for our clients’ businesses.”  \n He added: “For most companies, especially the SMEs, cash flow and financing are key to them sustaining their business. As their long-term banking partner, we believe our added support can help alleviate the business disruption and pressure from the ripple effect of the epidemic.” \n Aside from extending help to the SMEs, UOB said that it will also assess retail customers who are affected by the “current circumstances” on a case-by-case basis. \n OTHER MEASURES IN PLACE \n In its press release on Thursday, DBS said that it is working with partners to provide Singaporeans with subsidised or complimentary services to “navigate these challenging times”.  \n These include partnering with education firm 88Tuition to offer unlimited, free online supplementary lessons for primary and secondary school students from Feb 17 to April 30. This will allow students to continue to take classes while having minimal contact with others. \n The bank also announced a partnership with transport company ComfortDelGro in its initiative to use DBS’ debit or credit cards for street-hail hires, which will help in contact tracing. \n To show solidarity and support to healthcare workers and the broader frontline community, DBS will work with community partners to provide them with tokens of appreciation, such as care packages and food-and-beverages treats. \n Mr Shee Tse Koon, DBS Singapore country head, said: “In these difficult times, we feel it is incumbent upon us as Singapore’s largest bank to lend a helping hand to our clients and the public-at-large. We hope the liquidity measures will go some way in easing the financial pressure that some individuals and SMEs may face.” \n He added: “Other initiatives are intended to help customers adjust to the little changes they may have to make in daily living. Overall, we hope that these small gestures will go a long way in encouraging the community to press on.” \n "}, {"content": "Bolsas perderam €7 biliões em fevereiro.

BEIJING (AFP) - Police in China's virus epicentre Wuhan acted \"inappropriately\" by punishing a doctor who blew the whistle on the outbreak that has now killed more than 9,000 worldwide, a Chinese government investigation found on Thursday (March 19). \n Dr Li Wenliang, one of a group of doctors in Wuhan who shared posts on social media warning of a Sars-like virus spreading in the city in December, was reprimanded by police for sharing the information and made to sign a statement agreeing not to commit any more \"law-breaking actions\". \n His death from the virus in February prompted a national outpouring of grief as well as anger at the government's handling of the crisis, and bold demands for freedom of speech. \n A central government investigation initiated after Dr Li's death found that Wuhan police \"acted inappropriately by issuing a disciplinary letter\" and took \"irregular law enforcement procedures,\" state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday. \n The investigators also found that Dr Li's colleagues had repeatedly attempted to resuscitate the 34-year-old before he was declared dead because he was \"very young\", CCTV said. \n State media said his colleagues told investigators, \"as long as there was a bit of hope, we were unwilling to give up, at the time there were no other factors\". \n The central government investigators \"suggest\" that Wuhan authorities \"supervise and rectify the matter\", and urged local police to revoke the disciplinary statement issued to Dr Li, according to CCTV. \n Beijing has sought to direct criticism over the mishandling of the virus outbreak onto provincial officials, with several of the region's top Communist Party and health officials sacked. \n Dr Li's death had initially been reported by state media before their reports were quickly deleted. Wuhan Central Hospital confirmed Dr Li's death only hours later, after saying he was undergoing emergency treatment. \n Social media users who immediately took to the Twitter-like Weibo platform in droves to mourn Dr Li - before posts related to his death were scrubbed by censors - had accused hospital authorities of inappropriately attempting to resuscitate him after he had already died. \n China reported zero domestic Covid-19 infections for the first time on Thursday, even as nations across the world shut down in a desperate effort to contain the pandemic. \n China's central government has sought to distance itself from the origins of the disease, initially by sacking local officials blamed for allowing the virus to spread, and recently by supporting the conspiracy theory that Covid-19 originated in the United States. \n "}, {"content": "Coronavirus outbreak: Goa govt to form special task force.

SINGAPORE — Ms Sheryl Teo, 26, and her fiance Mr Bryan Cheong, 28, are not letting the Covid-19 outbreak stand in the way of a Valentine’s Day tradition they have maintained for four years. \n Ms Teo, who works in corporate communications, and Mr Cheong, a digital marketing executive, will be heading down to Tanjong Beach Club in Sentosa on Friday (Feb 14) night just as they initially planned. \n “Ever since our first Valentine’s Day together four years ago, we’ve been going to Sentosa beach for dinner and drinks to celebrate, and we planned to keep this tradition,” said Ms Teo. \n When they heard that Singapore’s first confirmed Covid-19 case was related to Sentosa, the pair discussed breaking this tradition to stay home and watch Netflix, but chose to wait and see before making a decision. A 66-year-old man from Wuhan, China tested positive to Covid-19 last month after staying at Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa. \n A few weeks later, the couple felt confident in Singapore’s ability to keep Covid-19 in check, and chose to keep up their romantic tradition. \n “Our mindset is that, ironically, the places in Singapore right now with confirmed cases of the virus are actually the cleanest places, because so much effort has been spent to make sure that these places are now disinfected. So Sentosa is actually pretty ideal for us now,” Ms Teo said. \n Mr Cheong said: “Most Singaporeans my age that I know aren’t really bothered by the outbreak. We don’t wear facemasks when we head out, although we wash our hands more often.” \n Ms Teo added: “I guess going ahead with our Valentine’s Day plan is my way of actively choosing not to let the virus affect my life any further than it should.” \n In the same way, Mr Chua Kok Teng, 44, is undeterred by the Covid-19 outbreak from taking his wife out to dinner tonight. \n But instead of dining in a restaurant at Dempsey Hill or Tanjong Pagar like they usually do on Valentine’s Day, the couple will spend this year’s occasion supping on ma la hot pot at an open air eatery. \n “We have never had ma la together, so my wife chose a place near our home in Clementi,” said Mr Chua, who is an engineer in the oil and gas industry. The pair do not drive, and decided to eat close to where they live in order to avoid taking transport to town. \n Other couples whom TODAY spoke to also had the Covid-19 outbreak in the back of their minds when planning for their Valentine’s Day celebrations. \n For their first Valentine’s Day together, Ms Angie Ching, 22, a student at Singapore Institute of Management, and her boyfriend Mr Tan Jun Xiong, 23, will be taking a long bus ride instead of their originally-planned MRT trip to their dinner spot at Bendemeer, in a bid to minimise the number of people they come in close contact with. \n Ms Ching reasoned that a bus typically has fewer passengers than a train. \n The lovebirds also initially wanted to spend the entirety of Saturday together, but decided to just have lunch and a karaoke session that day instead. \n Ms Ching said she felt sad and upset when she first feared they would have to scrap their romantic evening, as the duo have barely had time to be alone with one another in the last month due to the Chinese New Year celebrations and Mr Tan working on weekdays. \n Now that they elected to continue with most of their plans since they believe the outbreak situation here is under control, Ms Ching said: “I feel excited but a little wary, because the virus is still here in Singapore, and we have to stay vigilant and extra careful.” \n Mr Tan, who is working as an accountant while waiting for his university term to start, told TODAY: “Life still goes on, as long as we take care of ourselves and take a little more precaution during this period of time, then there’s no need to make it seem as though the world has stopped.” \n “Also, it’s our first Valentine’s together, a day where couples celebrate their love for each other. Why would we want to miss this?” \n Another couple, Mr Gareth Yeo, 33, who works as an IT specialist, and his wife Ms Sharon Yu, 32, a nurse working in a general hospital ward, will be spending most of their Valentine’s Day at home, making popiah for lunch, catching an afternoon movie on the sofa and having a quiet dinner at a restaurant in Sembawang. \n However, the reason they chose to remain indoors was not out of fear they might catch Covid-19, but rather because they felt that Ms Yu needed some extra rest. \n After working almost non-stop for the past seven days as part of her shift schedule, Ms Yu said it was a coincidence that one of her off-days fell on Valentine’s Day, and it was the perfect opportunity for her to spend time with her husband. \n “When I’m on night shift, I don’t get to see him at all, because he comes home at 7.30pm and I leave at 7pm, and when I come back in the morning he is already off to work,” she said. \n Mr Yeo, who took a leave day on Friday to be with his wife, planned the whole day for them both. \n “It feels like she was gone for a very long time, and now she’s back. She’s been very focused on her work for the past few days, and she’s simply had no time for other activities besides sleep, work, and cooking some simple meals,” he said. \n “I think she deserves some time to unwind after having such hectic working days,” he added. \n One couple refused to let Covid-19 alter their Valentine’s Day arrangements at all. \n Mr Yuen, 60, and Mrs Yuen, 58, who wish to be known only by their surnames, said that while their Valentine’s Day plans were simple, they would still continue with them as planned. \n “I’m not overly concerned, we just have to make sure we take the necessary precautions. So we won’t have any changes in our plan,” said Mr Yuen, who works as group head of engagement and programs at the Centre for Fathering. \n The couple have been married for 31 years with three grown children, and will be going out on Saturday evening for vegan food, which they said they have been experimenting with recently. \n Mrs Yuen, who is a project manager, said: “We usually take time off and do dinner, but our objective is to connect with one another. We are not so concerned about the flowers and champagne.” \n “We believe that a relationship isn’t just about Valentine’s Day. If you make time for each other, every day can be Valentine’s Day,” she added. \n Mr Chua said: “Naturally I am very worried about the outbreak. But I guess ultimately if we stick to the basic rules for personal hygiene, there will be many couples who can just have their usual Valentine’s Day programme.” \n “At the end of the day, there’s never a 100 per cent guarantee that you will be safe, and you can only worry so much. I guess you just have to strike a balance.” \n   \n "}, {"content": "Covid-19. PM espanhol apela à unidade política para combater pandemia.

Wegen des Ausbruchs des Coronavirus hat die australische Regierung ein Einreiseverbot für Reisende aus China verhängt. Von dem Verbot ausgenommen seien australische Staatsbürger und Menschen mit ständiger Aufenthaltsgenehmigung sowie deren Angehörige, sagte Premierminister Scott Morrison. Das Außenministerium hat seine Reisehinweise für China verschärft und empfiehlt Australiern nun, auf Reisen nach China zu verzichten.\nDas Einreiseverbot werde von den Grenzbehörden ab sofort umgesetzt, kündigte Morrison an. Die von dem Verbot ausgenommenen Reisenden müssten sich bei ihrer Rückkehr ins Land in eine zweiwöchige \"Selbstquarantäne\" begeben, sagte er. Damit folgt Morisson dem Beispiel der US-Regierung, die bereits einen Tag zuvor ein ähnliches Einreiseverbot verhängt hatte. Die Ausnahmen beim US-Verbot sind dieselben wie bei der australischen Regelung, auch die USA gaben eine Reisewarnung aus.\nDie chinesische Regierung hatte die USA wegen des Reiseverbots kritisiert. Sie zeuge \"gewiss nicht von Wohlwollen\", sagte ein Sprecher des chinesischen Außenministeriums. Während die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) von Reisebeschränkungen abgeraten habe, hätten die USA \"überstürzt den gegenteiligen Weg eingeschlagen\".\nDie \"Worte und Handlungen gewisser US-Vertreter\" entsprächen weder den Fakten noch seien sie \"angemessen\". Kritik hatte sich auch US-Handelsminister Wilbur Ross eingehandelt. Wie die New York Times berichtet, sagte er in einem Interview mit dem Sender Fox Business, der Ausbruch des Virus könnte dabei helfen, Arbeitsplätze in China zurück in die USA zu verlagern. Unternehmen müssten den Virus bei der Planung ihrer Lieferketten mitbedenken.\nDie WHO hatte wegen des Virus den internationalen Gesundheitsnotstand ausgerufen. Verbunden ist damit vor allem die Veröffentlichung konkreter Handlungsempfehlungen an alle Länder, um das Virus einzudämmen. WHO-Generaldirektor Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hatte bei der Bekanntgabe der Entscheidung betont, es handele sich nicht um ein \"Misstrauensvotum\" gegen China. Reise- und Handelsbeschränkungen seien nicht nötig.\nEnde 2019 meldeten die chinesischen Behörden der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO eine Häufung von Lungenentzündungen unklarer Ursache in der zentralchinesischen Stadt Wuhan. Bereits eine Woche später identifizierten chinesische Forscher ein neuartiges Virus als Ursache der Krankheitsfälle. Es gehört zur Gruppe der Coronaviren. Wenige Tage darauf veröffentlichte eine Gruppe um den Virologen Christian Drosten von der Berliner Charité den ersten diagnostischen Test für das neue Virus, das Forscher provisorisch 2019-nCoV nennen. Mit dem Test kann das Virus im Labor nachgewiesen werden. Als Quelle des Erregers vermuten die chinesischen Behörden einen Lebensmittelmarkt in Wuhan, auf dem neben Fisch und Meeresfrüchten auch exotische Tiere wie Schlangen verkauft wurden. Der Markt wurde geschlossen und desinfiziert.\nSowohl die Atemwegserkrankungen Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) als auch Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) werden von Coronaviren verursacht, die ihren Ursprung in Tieren haben. Während der Sars-Pandemie infizierten sich in den Jahren 2002 und 2003 etwa 8.000 Menschen, mehr als 750 starben. Mit dem Mers-Virus haben sich seit seiner Entdeckung 2012 bis zum Jahresende 2019 etwa 2.500 Menschen angesteckt, jeder Dritte ist daran gestorben. Insgesamt gibt es aber mehrere Hundert Arten von Coronaviren. Viele von ihnen betreffen die Atemwege und können zum Beispiel Erkältungen verursachen.\nIn China sind inzwischen mehrere Tausend Personen erkrankt, einige von ihnen – die meisten wohl mit Vorerkrankungen – sind an einer Lungenentzündung infolge des Virus gestorben. Die ersten Infektionsfälle außerhalb Chinas wurden in Thailand, Japan und Südkorea bekannt. Es handelt sich um Reisende, die vorher in Wuhan gewesen waren. Am 21. Januar meldeten US-Behörden die erste Infektion bei einem Touristen, der aus Wuhan zurückkam, am 24. Januar wurden die ersten Fälle in Frankreich bekannt. Mittlerweile wurden auch erste Fälle in Deutschland bestätigt. Typische Zeichen einer Infektion sind Fieber, Husten und Atembeschwerden. Das Virus kann eine Lungenentzündung verursachen, die tödlich enden kann. Da es sich um eine virale Krankheit handelt, helfen Antibiotika nicht.\nInzwischen ist klar, dass das Virus von Mensch zu Mensch übertragen werden kann. Chinesische Behörden haben mehrere solcher Übertragungen bestätigt, nachdem auch etwa ein Dutzend Fälle bei medizinischem Personal bekannt wurden. Medizinerinnen und Mediziner gehen davon aus, dass das Virus vor allem über Tröpfcheninfektion übertragen wird. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation rechnet, wie sie am 24. Januar mitteilte, momentan damit, dass ein Infizierter im Schnitt 1,4 bis 2,5 andere Menschen ansteckt. Bewahrheiten sich diese Zahlen, ist das Virus weniger ansteckend als Sars und auch die Virusgrippe. Die WHO empfiehlt generelle Hygieneregeln zu beachten: Man solle sich häufig die Hände waschen und engen Kontakt zu Personen mit Atemwegserkrankungen und wilden Tieren meiden.\nDas lässt sich noch nicht mit Sicherheit sagen. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation teilte am 28. Januar mit, dass ungefähr ein Fünftel der gemeldeten Fälle durch das Virus schwer krank werde, im Zweifelsfall also intensivmedizinisch behandelt werden muss. Berichten zufolge handelte es sich bei den ersten Todesopfern um Patienten, die teils schwere Vorerkrankungen hatten. Auch bei anderen Infektionskrankheiten sind Menschen mit Vorerkrankungen besonders gefährdet – etwa bei der Grippe. Coronaviren sind dafür bekannt, dass sie mutieren, also ihr Erbgut verändern können. Das kann dazu führen, dass sie im Laufe eines Ausbruchs gefährlicher für Menschen werden – aber auch zum genauen Gegenteil. Das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) erwartet zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt keine ähnlich hohe Mortalität wie beim Ausbruch von Sars.\nAustralien hatte am vergangenen Samstag die ersten drei Coronavirusfälle gemeldet, inzwischen liegt die Zahl der Infizierten in dem Land bei neun. Insgesamt sind weltweit knapp 12.000 Fälle registriert worden. Die Zahl der Verdachtsfälle liegt bei über 15.000, gestorben sind 259 Menschen, alle von ihnen in China. Insgesamt hat sich das Virus auf 27 Länder ausgebreitet, außerhalb Chinas sind bislang etwas mehr als hundert Personen betroffen.\nIn Deutschland haben sich sieben Menschen mit dem Virus infiziert. Mindestens sechs von ihnen befinden sich nach Angaben von Ärzten in gutem Zustand, zu einem Fall hat es noch keine Information gegeben. Eine Maschine der Luftwaffe, die mehr als hundert Deutsche aus Wuhan zurückbringen soll, ist bereits gestartet und soll am Morgen am Flughafen Frankfurt am Main eintreffen. Laut Außenminister Heiko Maas ist von den aus China ausgeflogenen Deutschen keiner infiziert. Dennoch gilt für sie nach ihrer Ankunft eine zweiwöchige Quarantäne an einem Bundeswehrstandort in Rheinland-Pfalz.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s coronavirus outbreak has tested the limits of free speech on the country’s heavily censored online and social media, with a brief window of liberalization that opened during January subsequently slammed shut by authorities.\nWhile censorship in China has tightened under President Xi Jinping, questions of transparency around the current outbreak are especially sensitive after Beijing’s cover-up of the extent of the 2003 SARS epidemic fuelled suspicion and mistrust, and  led to official calls for openness this time around.\nThe period from Jan 19 to Feb 1, when public concern about the coronavirus exploded just as China was gearing up for the Lunar New Year holiday, saw an uncharacteristic loosening. Online buzz about the outbreak flourished, with netizens largely unfettered in criticizing local authorities - but not central government leaders - over their handling of the crisis.\nThat liberalisation has come to end, with censors in the past week shutting down WeChat groups and scrubbing social media posts, according to Chinese reporters. Authorities have also reprimanded tech firms that gave free rein to online speech.\n“Xi Jinping has made it clear that he expects efforts to strengthen ‘the guidance of public opinion’ to be increased,” said Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) who studies Chinese social media.\n“We’ve already seen around 300 more journalists dispatched to Wuhan and surrounding areas to report on the outbreak. It’s highly likely their brief is to paint a rosier picture of the government’s relief efforts rather than engage in any muckraking or critical reporting.”\nThe cyberspace regulator, Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), did not respond to phone calls or to requests for comment sent by fax.\nChina’s censorship machine was tested last week when Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who had been reprimanded for issuing an early warning about coronavirus, died of the disease, triggering widespread outrage as well as mourning.\nOnline media outlets were permitted to report on Li’s death, but not the anger it had engendered, and early discussions on social media calling for the Wuhan government to apologise to him later disappeared.\nA notice sent to editors working for an online Chinese news outlet and seen by Reuters asked them not to “comment or speculate” on Li’s death, “do not hashtag and let the topic gradually die out from the hot search list, and guard against harmful information.”\nSarah Cook, the China media bulletin director at Freedom House, said that previous crises had also seen brief windows of openness, such as the deadly 2011 crash of a high-speed train and the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake, when domestic journalists and social media users felt emboldened.\n“At the same time, initially, officials might be a bit flat-footed and distracted dealing with an unexpected crisis so things slip through the cracks. Even censors within some social media companies may be sympathetic to some of the content and let it through,” she said.\nThe brief window of media freedom came after officials in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, admitted that it was much worse than anticipated and were heavily criticised for their move in January to reprimand eight people for “spreading rumours” on the emergence of the virus - one of whom was Li.\nLast week, however, CAC announced that it had punished some websites, mobile applications and social media accounts for publishing illicit content on the outbreak, saying it wanted to foster a “good online atmosphere” amid the country’s efforts to contain the epidemic.\nA notice circulated by CAC last week that was seen by Reuters asked audio and video platforms to step up control on “harmful information and rumour” related to Wuhan virus.\nIt also asked them to stick to official media such as Xinhua and People’s Daily, “not to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official livestreaming on the virus.”\nSome investigative articles published by local media outlets from Wuhan have also been deleted.\nChen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who was sending dispatches from Wuhan over Twitter - which is blocked in China - including images of corpses in the city’s hospitals, has been forcibly put under quarantine since Friday, according to his family and a friend managing his account in his absence.\nMany Chinese Internet users have turned to black humour or shared images, songs and other art forms in private WeChat groups to express their dismay.

Estreias adiadas, centenas de cinemas fechados em todo o mundo, salas quase fantasma, filmagens canceladas. O impacto do SARS-CoV-2​, vulgarmente conhecido como o novo coronavírus, na indústria do cinema está a levar a quebras imediatas nos resultados de bilheteira e a estimativas de perdas que podem ascender aos 4,5 mil milhões de euros em todo o mundo, mas sobretudo com o foco na Ásia.\nAs contas são de analistas citados pela revista Hollywood Reporter,  que estimam que as perdas podem ascender ou mesmo ultrapassar — basta o maior mercado de exibição mundial, os EUA, ser também vítima da quebra na afluência — os 4,5 mil milhões de euros. Os principais danos são sobretudo relacionados com a exibição de cinema nos países mais afectados pelo coronavírus, e que em alguns casos são mesmo dos mercados mais importantes do mundo. Não há prazo para regularizar a situação no que toca às decisões de empresas e autoridades, nem para a confiança da alguns espectadores regressar.\nOs países mais afectados pela diminuição abrupta do número de espectadores são a China (segundo maior mercado do mundo), a Coreia do Sul (quinto maior mercado do mundo), Itália ou o Japão (terceiro maior mercado do mundo). Além de, no mundo do entretenimento, haver digressões de músicos adiadas para as suas porções asiáticas ou eventos promocionais ou de imprensa que passam a sessões de Skype ou de conferências via web, o fecho de cinemas, a fuga dos espectadores e o cancelamento de estreias nos importantes mercados chinês ou sul-coreano estão a ter um impacto directo no cinema.\nNa China há 70 mil cinemas fechados e sem previsão de reabertura para os próximos meses. Uma gigantesca quebra nos resultados de bilheteira é palpável nos números: a revista Variety cita dados da analista de mercado cinematográfico Comscore que mostram como nos primeiros dois meses de 2020 a bilheteira chinesa lucrou apenas 214 milhões de euros (resultados brutos) contra os 1,8 mil milhões de euros que tinha encaixado em 2019. Só no último mês, o do Ano novo chinês e aquele em que o surto de Covid-19 se tornou conhecido, as receitas passaram de 1,5 mil milhões de euros em 2019 para meros 4,2 milhões de euros este ano.\nNa Coreia do Sul a perda é de 70% em relação ao ano passado. “Os cinemas estão abertos, mas mais valia não estarem”, diz um distribuidor sob anonimato à Hollywood Reporter. “A situação é muito pior do que o que vimos durante o surto de MERS em 2015 [a síndrome respiratória do Médio Oriente — MERS-CoV]. Na altura houve uma quebra de público de mais de 40% mas não havia cinemas fechados e o mercado ressuscitou passado um mês”, diz à mesma publicação o responsável da Film Commission da Coreia do Sul. Os espectadores tendem a evitar as salas numa altura em que há já mais de 4800 casos no país, onde por exemplo a estreia de uma versão a preto-e-branco de Parasitas, o filme sul-coreano que historicamente arrebatou os Óscares este ano, foi adiada.\nNo Japão (980 casos confirmados esta terça-feira), estima-se que haja uma quebra de 10 a 15% no box office. Já em Itália, o maior foco europeu da nova doença, só no fim-de-semana passado a afluência aos cinemas italianos caiu 75% em relação ao mesmo fim-de-semana de 2019, por exemplo. Esta semana, em Itália há cerca de 850 ecrãs sem funcionar — o total no país é de 1830, recorda a Variety. As estreias de alguns filmes norte-americanos foram adiadas.\nTambém na China as estreias de filmes norte-americanos para as próximas semanas e meses estão suspensas: foram adiadas as estreias de Mulan, 007: Sem Tempo Para Morrer, Dolittle, 191, Jojo Rabbit, Sonic o Filme; na Coreia do Sul, a estreia de Bora Lá, da Pixar, também está sem data. O adiamento de estreias globais simultâneas, nomeadamente falhando o importante mercado chinês, aumenta o risco de pirataria e da perda adicional de receitas.\nOlhar para o futuro é coisa difícil para já. Na capital chinesa, por exemplo, é preciso cumprir as directivas do Centro de Prevenção e Controlo de Doenças e do Gabinete Municipal de Cinema, que desde 26 de Fevereiro obrigam a que as autoridades aprovem previamente a entrada em funcionamento dos cinemas. Para reabrir é preciso que só sejam vendidos bilhetes em filas alternadas e só a espectadores que se identifiquem. Cada sala deve ser profundamente desinfectada logo após uma sessão e antes da seguinte.\nQuanto a filmagens, recorda a Variety, se as equipas forem inferiores a 50 pessoas, estão quase automaticamente autorizadas a filmar em Pequim desde que a temperatura corporal dos trabalhadores não ultrapasse os 37 graus centígrados e que todos (excepto actores) usem máscaras. As equipas maiores estão ainda proibidas de trabalhar. “Olhando para a situação actual, a indústria do cinema não está equipada para retomar o trabalho”, admite Chen Bei, vice-secretário-geral do governo municipal de Pequim. Entre os filmes que ficam em suspenso está o próximo projecto de Jia Zhang-ke, como disse o realizador ao site IndieWire, cuja rodagem está adiada sine die.\nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\nNeste campo, e entre as primeiras vítimas profissionais de relevo do impacto do coronavírus estão as filmagens do próximo Missão: Impossível em Veneza, suspensas até nota em contrário.\nA indústria ressente-se também no lado puramente negocial. A presença de compradores chineses em mercados do audiovisual como o MIPTV desta Primavera, à semelhança do que se verificou com a fraca adesão de distribuidores chineses no último Festival de Cinema de Berlim, deve ser escassa e podem perder-se assim acordos de distribuição importantes. Com cancelamentos ou adiamentos de eventos e feiras um pouco por todo o mundo, da Feira do Livro Infantil de Bolonha ao Salão do Livro de Paris, a Hollywood Reporter indica que o Festival de Cannes está ainda em cima da mesa e que os preparativos para o maior evento internacional do cinema continuam, ainda que atentos aos “desenvolvimentos e directivas das autoridades”.\n"}, {"content": "UN, UNSC yet to hold formal discussions on Covid-19 even as global death toll crosses 21,000.

PITTSBURG, Pennsylvania: Snakes – the Chinese krait and the Chinese cobra – may be the original source of the newly discovered coronavirus that has triggered an outbreak of a deadly infectious respiratory illness in China this winter. \n The illness was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, a major city in central China, and has been rapidly spreading. Since then, sick travelers from Wuhan have infected people in China and other countries, including the United States. \n Using samples of the virus isolated from patients, scientists in China have determined the genetic code of the virus and used microscopes to photograph it. The pathogen responsible for this pandemic is a new coronavirus. \n It’s in the same family of viruses as the well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), which have killed hundreds of people in the past 17 years. \n The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV. But there are many questions that need to be answered to curb the spread of this public health threat. \n THE DEADLY WUHAN CORONAVIRUS \n The name of coronavirus comes from its shape, which resembles a crown or solar corona when imaged using an electron microscope. \n Coronavirus is transmitted through the air and primarily infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds. \n Though most of the members of the coronavirus family only cause mild flu-like symptoms during infection, SARS and MERS can infect both upper and lower airways and cause severe respiratory illness and other complications in humans. \n  \n This new 2019-nCoV causes similar symptoms to SARS and MERS. People infected with these coronaviruses suffer a severe inflammatory response. \n Unfortunately, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment available for coronavirus infection. \n A better understanding of the life cycle of 2019-nCoV, including the source of the virus, how it is transmitted and how it replicates are needed to both prevent and treat the disease. \n THE PROBLEM WITH ZOONOTIC TRANSMISSIONS \n Both SARS and MERS are classified as zoonotic viral diseases, meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals. \n This was possible because while in the animal host, the virus had acquired a series of genetic mutations that allowed it to infect and multiply inside humans. \n Now these viruses can be transmitted from person to person. \n Field studies have revealed that the original source of SARS and MERS is the bat, and that the masked palm civets (a mammal native to Asia and Africa) and camels, respectively, served as intermediate hosts between bats and humans. \n In the case of this 2019 coronavirus outbreak, reports state that most of the first group of patients hospitalised were workers or customers at a local seafood wholesale market which also sold processed meats and live consumable animals including poultry, donkeys, sheep, pigs, camels, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs and reptiles. \n  \n However, since no one has ever reported finding a coronavirus infecting aquatic animals, it is plausible that the coronavirus may have originated from other animals sold in that market. \n The hypothesis that the 2019-nCoV jumped from an animal at the market is strongly supported by a new publication in the Journal of Medical Virology. The scientists conducted an analysis and compared the genetic sequences of 2019-nCoV and all other known coronaviruses. \n The study of the genetic code of 2019-nCoV reveals that the new virus is most closely related to two bat SARS-like coronavirus samples from China, initially suggesting that, like SARS and MERS, the bat might also be the origin of 2019-nCoV. \n The authors further found that the RNA coding sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, which forms the “crown” of the virus particle that recognises the receptor on a host cell, indicates that the bat virus might have mutated before infecting people. \n But when the researchers performed a more detailed bioinformatics analysis of the sequence of 2019-nCoV, it suggests that this coronavirus might come from snakes. \n FROM BATS TO SNAKES \n The researchers used an analysis of the protein codes favoured by the new coronavirus and compared it to the protein codes from coronaviruses found in different animal hosts, like birds, snakes, marmots, hedgehogs, manis, bats and humans. \n Surprisingly, they found that the protein codes in the 2019-nCoV are most similar to those used in snakes. \n Snakes often hunt for bats in wild. \n Reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-nCoV might have jumped from the host species – bats – to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak. \n However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery. \n The authors of the report and other researchers must verify the origin of the virus through laboratory experiments. Searching for the 2019-nCoV sequence in snakes would be the first thing to do. \n  \n However, since the outbreak, the seafood market has been disinfected and shut down, which makes it challenging to trace the new virus’ source animal. \n Sampling RNA from animals sold at the market and from wild snakes and bats is needed to confirm the origin of the virus. Nonetheless, the reported findings will also provide insights for developing prevention and treatment protocols. \n The 2019-nCoV outbreak is another reminder that people should limit the consumption of wild animals to prevent zoonotic infections. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram \n Haitao Guo is Professor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro struggled near 3-year lows on Monday as investors worried about weakening growth in the region, while Chinese efforts to limit the damage from a coronavirus outbreak appeared to calm markets, with the yuan and Australian dollar gaining.\nMonday is light on economic data but traders are looking to a German business sentiment indicator due on Tuesday and purchasing managers index flash data on Friday for further evidence on the state of the euro zone economy.\nLast week data showed in particular that momentum in Germany, the region’s powerhouse economy, was struggling.\n“EUR/USD seems to be comfortably trading around its new lows and in the next few days we expect to see a continuation in the recent downtrend rather than any clear rebound,” said ING analysts.\n“The fears around the coronavirus impact on the Eurozone economy remain well in place while data this week should be in line with latest releases in providing a non-encouraging picture.”\nThe euro nudged higher to $1.0845 EUR=EBS in early trading but had earlier touched $1.0817, its weakest since mid-2017.\nThe currency has lost 2.3% of its value against the dollar so far in February.\nKit Juckes, an analyst at Societe Generale, said that while data shows that the market is building a short euro position, “it remains a long way from its peaks”.\nIt was a quiet start to the week elsewhere, with much of the United States off for a public holiday.\nThe yen was unfazed by weak economic growth data in Japan. It traded down 0.1% at 109.84 yen per dollar JPY=EBS.\nJapan, the world’s third-largest economy, shrank 1.6% in the three months to December, the largest drop in six years, hit by a sales tax hike.\nWith growth faltering in the euro zone and Japan, most market players expect the U.S. economy to remain stronger among its developed world peers, although retail sales and industrial production numbers on Friday were disappointing.\nThe dollar index .DXY stood at 99.095, near Friday’s 4-1/2-month high of 99.241.\nThe Australian dollar strengthened as investors assessed the latest reading on the coronavirus in China, where the number of cases rose but new deaths dropped.\nThe Australian dollar, used as a proxy for risk on Chinese assets, rose 0.1% to $0.6724 AUD=D3. The currency has partly been supported by expectations of stimulus from Beijing.\nThe offshore Chinese yuan CNH=EBS gained 0.2% to 6.9815 per dollar.\nSome analysts think the market may be underestimating the hit from the coronavirus on both China’s economy and on growth in the rest of the world, especially Asia.\n“For China, our new base case is 3.0% GDP growth in Q1, with the risk firmly skewed to an even lower number - too much damage has already been done and initial policy stimulus will not be very effective,” Nomura strategists said in a research note.\nSterling slipped 0.2% to $1.3015 GBP=D3, reversing some of its gains last week when the appointment of a new British finance minister raised expectations that the government would significantly lift public spending in next month's budget.\n"}, {"content": "Und jetzt alle auf die Grippe. Was kann der Einzelne angesichts des Ausbruchs des neuen Coronavirus tun? Wie sich wappnen für den Fall, dass der Lungeninfekt aus China auch in Europa zur Epidemie wird? Der Chef des britischen Wellcome Trust, der weltweit zweitreichsten Stiftung zur Förderung medizinischer Forschung, twitterte bereits vor einigen Tagen: \"Eine Sache, die helfen würde, ist, sich gegen Grippe impfen zu lassen.\"\nZunächst erscheint das merkwürdig. Denn eine Grippeschutzimpfung schützt nicht vor einer Infektion mit dem Virus namens 2019-nCoV, das sich von der Stadt Wuhan aus seit dem Jahreswechsel in China und über Ländergrenzen hinweg ausbreitet. Vereinzelt ist es schon nach Europa eingeschleppt worden. Auch in Deutschland hat sich ein Mensch mit dem Erreger infiziert.\nDie Idee hinter dem Aufruf von Jeremy Farrar zur Grippeimpfung war eine andere: Weil die Symptome einer echten Grippe (siehe Kasten) und der durch das Coronavirus ausgelösten Lungenkrankheit zu Beginn ähnlich sein können, würden Influenza-Patientinnen und -Patienten im Zweifelsfall schnell zu Corona-Verdachtsfällen. Mit allen Folgen, die das hätte. Auch sie müssten dann isoliert und auf den Erreger, der sie infiziert hat, getestet werden. Nicht zuletzt würden die Betroffenen in Angst und Schrecken versetzt. Insofern könnten Grippeschutzimpfungen den Druck auf das Gesundheitssystem mildern, den der neue Erreger entfalten könnte, sollte er auch bei uns zu einer Epidemie führen. Kurz gesagt: Je milder die Grippesaison, desto weniger zusätzliche Probleme hätten Seuchenbekämpfer.\nDie durch das Influenza-Virus ausgelöste Grippe beginnt meist plötzlich mit Fieber, trockenem Reizhusten, Muskel- und/oder Kopfschmerzen. Weitere Symptome können allgemeine Schwäche, Schweißausbrüche, aber auch Übelkeit/Erbrechen und Durchfall sein. Die Krankheitsdauer liegt in der Regel bei fünf bis sieben Tagen.\nDie aktuelle Grippesituation in Deutschland können Sie auf de Website der Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza sehen.\nBei Weitem nicht alle Influenza-Infizierten erkranken so typisch. Je nach Schwere der Grippesaison sterben pro Jahr einige hundert bis zu mehr als 20.000 Menschen hierzulande an einer Grippe (Quelle: Robert Koch-Institut)\nEine Ansteckung erfolgt überwiegend durch Tröpfchen, wie sie insbesondere beim Husten oder Niesen entstehen. Sie gelangen über eine geringe Distanz auf die Schleimhäute der Atemwege von gesunden Menschen. Darüber hinaus ist eine Übertragung auch über Hände und Oberflächen möglich, die durch virushaltige Sekrete verunreinigt sind.\nDie Ständige Impfkommission (STIKO) des Robert-Koch-Instituts (RKI) empfiehlt die Influenzaimpfung für alle Personen ab 60 Jahre, alle Schwangeren, Personen mit erhöhter gesundheitlicher Gefährdung (z.B. Personen mit chronischen Krankheiten der Atmungsorgane, Herz- oder Kreislaufkrankheiten, Leber- oder Nierenkrankheiten, Diabetes oder andere Stoffwechselkrankheiten, Multiple Sklerose, angeborene oder erworbene Immundefizienz) sowie für Bewohner von Alters- oder Pflegeheimen.\nAußerdem sollten Personen mit erhöhter Gefährdung (z.B. medizinisches Personal) und Personen geimpft werden, die von ihnen betreute Risikopersonen infizieren könnten. Ebenso geimpft werden sollten Personen mit direktem Kontakt zu Geflügel und Wildvögeln (die Impfung schützt zwar nicht vor der Vogelgrippe, aber es werden damit problematische Doppelinfektionen vermieden).\nÄhnlich sieht es das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI), auch wenn dessen Präsident Lothar Wieler die Empfehlung, sich gegen Grippe impfen zu lassen, bei einem Presseauftritt mit Gesundheitsminister Jens Spahn (CDU) am Dienstag auf besondere Risikogruppen beschränkte. Diejenigen, für die die Ständige Impfkommission (Stiko) seines Instituts ohnehin eine Grippeschutzimpfung empfehle, sollten diese jetzt bitte auch wahrnehmen, sagte er.\nGemeint sind damit Menschen ab 60 Jahren, Schwangere, chronisch Kranke und auch Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter sowie Bewohner von Alten- oder Pflegeheimen sowie Personen mit stark erhöhtem Risiko, sich und andere mit einer Influenza anzustecken – also zum Beispiel medizinisches Personal oder Menschen in Einrichtungen mit viel Publikumsverkehr.\nUnterstützung bekommt das RKI dabei von Politikerinnen und Politikern. \"Eine Grippeimpfung macht immer Sinn, das gilt jetzt erst recht\", sagte der für Gesundheitspolitik zuständige stellvertretende Fraktionsvorsitzende der Union, Georg Nüßlein (CSU) im Gespräch mit ZEIT ONLINE. Ob die Stiko deswegen ihre Impfempfehlungen auf alle Bürger und Bürgerinnen ausweiten solle, müssten die Fachleute selbst entscheiden.\n\"Wir haben derzeit keinerlei Anlass für Zwangsmaßnahmen oder Eingriffe irgendeiner Art. Es gibt keinen Anlass zur Panik\", betonte Nüßlein. Insbesondere die Hausärztinnen und Hausärzte sollten Patienten aber jetzt verstärkt auf den Grippeschutz hinweisen. \"Das dient auch dem Sicherheitsgefühl und dem Wohlbefinden der Menschen\", sagte Nüßlein.\nEnde 2019 meldeten die chinesischen Behörden der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO eine Häufung von Lungenentzündungen unklarer Ursache in der zentralchinesischen Stadt Wuhan. Bereits eine Woche später identifizierten chinesische Forscher ein neuartiges Virus als Ursache der Krankheitsfälle. Es gehört zur Gruppe der Coronaviren. Wenige Tage darauf veröffentlichte eine Gruppe um den Virologen Christian Drosten von der Berliner Charité den ersten diagnostischen Test für das neue Virus, das Forscher provisorisch 2019-nCoV nennen. Mit dem Test kann das Virus im Labor nachgewiesen werden. Als Quelle des Erregers vermuten die chinesischen Behörden einen Lebensmittelmarkt in Wuhan, auf dem neben Fisch und Meeresfrüchten auch exotische Tiere wie Schlangen verkauft wurden. Der Markt wurde geschlossen und desinfiziert.\nSowohl die Atemwegserkrankungen Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) als auch Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) werden von Coronaviren verursacht, die ihren Ursprung in Tieren haben. Während der Sars-Pandemie infizierten sich in den Jahren 2002 und 2003 etwa 8.000 Menschen, mehr als 750 starben. Mit dem Mers-Virus haben sich seit seiner Entdeckung 2012 bis zum Jahresende 2019 etwa 2.500 Menschen angesteckt, jeder Dritte ist daran gestorben. Insgesamt gibt es aber mehrere Hundert Arten von Coronaviren. Viele von ihnen betreffen die Atemwege und können zum Beispiel Erkältungen verursachen.\nIn China sind inzwischen mehrere Tausend Personen erkrankt, einige von ihnen – die meisten wohl mit Vorerkrankungen – sind an einer Lungenentzündung infolge des Virus gestorben. Die ersten Infektionsfälle außerhalb Chinas wurden in Thailand, Japan und Südkorea bekannt. Es handelt sich um Reisende, die vorher in Wuhan gewesen waren. Am 21. Januar meldeten US-Behörden die erste Infektion bei einem Touristen, der aus Wuhan zurückkam, am 24. Januar wurden die ersten Fälle in Frankreich bekannt. Mittlerweile wurden auch erste Fälle in Deutschland bestätigt. Typische Zeichen einer Infektion sind Fieber, Husten und Atembeschwerden. Das Virus kann eine Lungenentzündung verursachen, die tödlich enden kann. Da es sich um eine virale Krankheit handelt, helfen Antibiotika nicht.\nInzwischen ist klar, dass das Virus von Mensch zu Mensch übertragen werden kann. Chinesische Behörden haben mehrere solcher Übertragungen bestätigt, nachdem auch etwa ein Dutzend Fälle bei medizinischem Personal bekannt wurden. Medizinerinnen und Mediziner gehen davon aus, dass das Virus vor allem über Tröpfcheninfektion übertragen wird. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation rechnet, wie sie am 24. Januar mitteilte, momentan damit, dass ein Infizierter im Schnitt 1,4 bis 2,5 andere Menschen ansteckt. Bewahrheiten sich diese Zahlen, ist das Virus weniger ansteckend als Sars und auch die Virusgrippe. Die WHO empfiehlt generelle Hygieneregeln zu beachten: Man solle sich häufig die Hände waschen und engen Kontakt zu Personen mit Atemwegserkrankungen und wilden Tieren meiden.\nDas lässt sich noch nicht mit Sicherheit sagen. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation teilte am 28. Januar mit, dass ungefähr ein Fünftel der gemeldeten Fälle durch das Virus schwer krank werde, im Zweifelsfall also intensivmedizinisch behandelt werden muss. Berichten zufolge handelte es sich bei den ersten Todesopfern um Patienten, die teils schwere Vorerkrankungen hatten. Auch bei anderen Infektionskrankheiten sind Menschen mit Vorerkrankungen besonders gefährdet – etwa bei der Grippe. Coronaviren sind dafür bekannt, dass sie mutieren, also ihr Erbgut verändern können. Das kann dazu führen, dass sie im Laufe eines Ausbruchs gefährlicher für Menschen werden – aber auch zum genauen Gegenteil. Das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) erwartet zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt keine ähnlich hohe Mortalität wie beim Ausbruch von Sars.\nÄhnlich sieht es seine SPD-Kollegin, Fraktionsvize Bärbel Bas. \"Eine Grippeimpfung ist sinnvoll. Aus meiner Sicht sollten sich mehr Menschen impfen\", sagte sie ZEIT ONLINE. Einen Grund, die Grippe-Impfempfehlung auszuweiten, sieht die Politikerin allerdings nicht. Den Aufwand, einen Menschen mit Verdacht auf eine Coronaviren-Infektion zu testen, sei überschaubar: \"Wenn Symptome einer Infektion mit dem Coronavirus vorliegen und die betroffene Person in den letzten 14 Tagen in einem Risikogebiet in China war oder Kontakt zu einer erkrankten Person hatte, dann wird diese Person unter Einhaltung hygienischer Maßnahmen wie einem Mund-Nase-Schutz auf den Coronavirus getestet\", sagte Bas.\nEin Test liefere dann in wenigen Stunden ein Ergebnis und sei auch in Deutschland ausreichend verfügbar. Den Test könnten auch Menschen machen, die in der chinesischen Provinz Hubei waren – von deren Hauptstadt Wuhan aus hatte sich der Erreger im Januar weiter ausgebreitet – oder Kontakt zu einer nachgewiesen infizierten Person hatten, auch wenn sie noch keine Symptome hätten.\nGenerell ist nach Einschätzung von Medizinern die beste Zeit sich impfen zu lassen zwar der Oktober oder November, also bevor die Grippezeit beginnt. Doch auch jetzt könne eine Impfung noch sinnvoll sein, betonte RKI-Präsident Wieler. Die Zeit nach dem Jahreswechsel gilt generell als diejenige, in der besonders viele Grippeinfektionen zu verzeichnen sind. Bis die Impfung ihre Schutzwirkung entfalten kann, dauere es allerdings zehn bis 14 Tage.\nImpfen lassen können sich natürlich auch Menschen, die nicht zu den Risikogruppen gehören. Viele Krankenkassen – darunter die drei größten, nämlich Techniker Krankenkasse (TK), Deutsche Angestellten Krankenkasse (DAK) und die Barmer Ersatzkasse (BEK) –übernehmen die Kosten für alle Versicherten, die das wünschen.\nBei gesunden, jungen Menschen reduziert die Impfung das Risiko, an Grippe zu erkranken um 80 Prozent, bei älteren Menschen, denen die Impfung wegen des statistisch höheren Sterberisikos durch den Infekt besonders empfohlen wird, sind es immer noch 41 bis 63 Prozent. Laut den Forscherinnen und Forschern am RKI werden trotz mäßiger Impfquoten durch die Vakzine jährlich um die 400.000 Influenza-Erkrankungen allein bei den über 60-Jährigen verhindert. Je nach Schwere der Grippesaison und Art des Erregers – der sich jedes Jahr wandelt, weshalb auch der Impfstoff stets weiterentwickelt und jährlich neu verabreicht werden muss – sterben hierzulande zwischen wenigen Hundert und mehr als 20.000 Menschen pro Jahr an einer Grippe. 2017/18 waren es sogar 25.100.\nWer sich und andere vor einer Ansteckung schützen will, für den hat RKI-Vize-Präsident Lars Schaade auch jenseits der Impfungen noch ein paar praktische Tipps: In den Ellenbogen niesen, häufig die Hände waschen, Abstand halten zu Menschen, die erkältet sind. \"Das schützt vor Influenza und gilt auch, sollten wir mehr Fälle des neuen Coronavirus in Deutschland bekommen.\"\nLesen Sie hier mehr zum neuen Coronavirus.\n"}, {"content": "Yen holds gains on virus woes, euro crumbles on weak growth outlook.

Formar al personal de urgencias y dotarse de herramientas para el diagnóstico rápido de los pacientes que puedan ingresar con el coronavirus de Wuhan. Así se preparan los grandes hospitales españoles ante el brote que acecha a China y que ha llegado a otros nueve países a bordo de vuelos internacionales. No es por ahora el caso de España: el Ministerio de Sanidad informó este viernes de que dos casos sospechosos bajo estudio, personas con dolencias respiratorias llegadas recientemente de Wuhan, han dado negativo a las pruebas realizadas. Pero a última hora de la noche el País Vasco notificó que tenían una paciente con algunos síntomas sospechosos que estaba bajo vigilancia y que recientemente había visitado Wuhan.\n“Lo estamos siguiendo todo con gran interés, pero también con tranquilidad. Es muy poco probable que el nuevo virus llegue a ser un problema relevante en España”, considera Santiago Moreno, jefe del servicio de enfermedades infecciosas del hospital Ramón y Cajal (Madrid). Esta posición coincide con la mantenida por el ministerio. “La población tiene que tener un nivel de percepción de riesgo muy bajo”, afirmó Fernando Simón, director del Centro de Coordinación de Alertas y Emergencias Sanitarias, en la presentación de las medidas acordadas por Sanidad y las comunidades autónomas.\nTres ideas son las más repetidas por los especialistas consultados por este diario. La primera es que lo que se sabe del virus aún es poco. “No sabemos la tasa de transmisibilidad, que nos dice a cuánta gente contagia cada caso. Tampoco conocemos si hay casos asintomáticos o con síntomas muy leves”, explica Jesús Rodríguez Baño, jefe del servicio de enfermedades infecciosas del hospital Virgen Macarena (Sevilla).\nLa segunda es que, con los datos disponibles, el de Wuhan parece menos virulento que los otros coronavirus que han causado brotes epidémicos desde 2002. “La mortalidad no llega al 5%, mientras que con el SARS y el MERS eran muy superiores [10% y 35%, respectivamente]”, afirma Juan Carlos Galán, portavoz de la Sociedad Española de Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiología (Seimc). Además, “aunque se ha demostrado la transmisión de persona a persona, no parece muy alta, menor que con en el SARS”, añade Magda Campins, jefa de Medicina Preventiva del hospital Vall d’Hebron (Barcelona).\nComo tercera idea importante, los expertos concluyen que, hasta que las investigaciones avancen y los organismos internacionales establezcan recomendaciones más precisas, lo recomendable es “adoptar aquí las medidas necesarias para estar preparados si llega algún caso”, sostiene José Miguel Cisneros, jefe de servicio de enfermedades infecciosas del Hospital Virgen del Rocío. “Y estar tranquilos, porque nuestro sistema de salud pública y nuestros hospitales están sobradamente preparados para hacer frente a un episodio como este”, añade.\nLas primeras medidas adoptadas por los hospitales pasan por “preparar protocolos para el personal de urgencias, que es la puerta de entrada al hospital”, precisa Campins. “El objetivo es determinar si el paciente sufre síntomas compatibles con el virus y si ha viajado recientemente a Wuhan”, añade. Si coinciden ambos hechos, “el paciente debe ser ingresado de forma aislada y el personal sanitario adoptar las medidas de precaución habitual hasta que se descarte o confirme que la dolencia está causada por el virus”, relata Rodríguez Baño. Estas medidas pasan por “la protección de manos y las barreras respiratorias, como mascarillas de alto grado de protección por si acaso hubiera transmisión aérea”, añade.\nLas instrucciones que ultiman el Ministerio de Sanidad y las comunidades autónomas establecen que las muestras de todos los pacientes sospechosos serán remitidas al Centro Nacional de Microbiología (CNM), que será el de referencia y tendrá los resultados en aproximadamente un día. Pero los grandes hospitales cuentan con una tecnología, llamada PCR, que permite avanzar el diagnóstico en muy pocas horas. “Estamos adquiriendo los kits específicos para identificar genéticamente el virus de Wuhan con la PCR”, cuenta Campins. “Hemos ordenado la compra y nos llegarán el lunes”, explican desde el Ramón y Cajal.\nFernando Simón explicó el viernes que si se detecta algún caso positivo, se hará un seguimiento de contactos, aunque el virus no tenga “mucha transmisibilidad”. En un vuelo, por ejemplo, se seguiría la evolución de los dos pasajeros sentados a su lado. El objetivo es que la red pública tenga la sensibilidad para detectar los casos sin bloquear el sistema sanitario. Sanidad no se plantea por ahora tomar medidas excepcionales en los aeropuertos, ya que no hay vuelos directos desde Wuhan y es una medida “que no ha demostrado utilidad”, según Simón. Este explicó que es muy frecuente que pasajeros que proceden de vuelos largos sufran síntomas respiratorios, más en invierno, por lo que aplicar controles a las llegadas “no aportaría un beneficio suficiente”.\nSanidad concluye que “no es muy probable, pero puede pasar” que el virus llegue a España. “Por eso estamos preparados para actuar”, explicó Simón, que recordó que lo más importante en estos brotes son las actuaciones en origen y que considera que las cuarentenas en China reducen el riesgo.\n"}, {"content": "chinese president xi jinping, under fire, says he led covid-19 fight early on. BEIJING — Under fire for its response to the coronavirus epidemic, China’s authoritarian government appears to be pushing a new account of events that presents President Xi Jinping as taking early action to fight the outbreak that has convulsed the country. \n But in doing so, authorities have acknowledged for the first time that Mr Xi was aware of the epidemic and involved in the response nearly two weeks before he first spoke publicly about it — and while officials at its epicentre in the city of Wuhan were still playing down its dangers. \n That new account risks drawing the president, China’s most powerful leader in decades, directly into questions about whether top officials did too little, too late. \n In an internal speech published Saturday, Mr Xi said he had “issued demands about the efforts to prevent and control” the coronavirus Jan 7, during a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest council of the Communist Party, whose sessions are typically cloaked in secrecy. \n In the speech, he also said he had authorised the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan and other cities beginning Jan 23. \n “I have at every moment monitored the spread of the epidemic and progress in efforts to curtail it, constantly issuing oral orders and also instructions,” Mr Xi said of his more recent involvement. \n Mr Xi’s advisers may have hoped that publishing the speech, delivered Feb 3, would dispel speculation about his recent retreat from public view and reassure his people that he can be trusted to lead them out of the epidemic. The virus so far has officially infected more than 68,000 people and killed more than 1,650 worldwide, the vast majority in mainland China. \n “The overall tone of the speech appears to be defensive,” said Dr Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. “He wants to change the narrative, which until this point has been very unfavourable to the top leadership.” \n Delivered at a meeting with top party officials, when the epidemic had already spiraled into a national crisis, the speech could expose Mr Xi to criticism that he didn’t treat the initial threat urgently enough and make it difficult for him to shift blame onto local officials for what many see as the government’s early mishandling of the epidemic. \n The remarks also raise questions about what top leaders knew at the time and what instructions they issued based on that knowledge. \n That Mr Xi convened a meeting of China’s highest political body in early January indicates that the coronavirus was already being seen as a matter of high-level concern — making his subsequent silence even more conspicuous, experts said. \n An official account of the Jan 7 Standing Committee meeting issued at the time by Xinhua, the state news agency, made no mention of a discussion of the coronavirus. \n “It seems like he’s trying to indicate that ‘We weren’t asleep at the wheel,’” said Dr Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “But it comes off like, ‘We knew this was a problem, but we weren’t sounding the alarm.’” \n In the speech this month, Mr Xi signaled his displeasure with lower-level bureaucrats for their “shortcomings” in implementing the party’s top-level directives. \n In early January, officials in Wuhan were giving open assurances that human-to-human transmission of the virus was unlikely. Some government experts agreed. \n “For now, it seems there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission,” Dr Xu Jianguo, a senior expert on communicable diseases at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview in early January with Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper. “This shows that the threat level from this virus is limited.” \n The new information places Mr Xi’s involvement in fighting the epidemic much earlier than was previously known. His earliest public comment on the epidemic came Jan 20, when he gave brief instructions that were published in state media. \n In the days after Mr Xi’s Jan 7 orders were issued, politicians in Wuhan met for the annual meeting of the city’s People’s Congress, its party-controlled legislature. Over that time, the Wuhan health commission’s daily bulletins on the outbreak said repeatedly that there were no new cases of infection, no firm evidence of human-to-human transmission and no infection of medical workers. \n But signs were growing that politicians and government experts underestimated the potency of the new coronavirus. On Jan 9, a 61-year-old man surnamed Zeng died — the earliest confirmed fatality from the virus. Already, some doctors in Wuhan hospitals were worried enough to warn friends and propose special wards for patients showing symptoms of infection. \n Even after Mr Xi made his first public remarks about the epidemic Jan 20, he mostly kept it at the bottom of his public agenda. On the day before the Chinese New Year holiday began in late January, he took the stage at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and declared his success in guiding China through a difficult year — making no mention of the virus that was already spreading fear throughout the country. \n In the days after, he all but disappeared from public view, emerging only a handful of times to preside over Communist Party meetings and to meet foreign visitors, including the director-general of the World Health Organization and Cambodia’s autocratic leader, Mr Hun Sen. \n In the meantime, he directed China’s No. 2 leader, Mr Li Keqiang, to lead the group handling the emergency, effectively turning him into the public face of the response. \n For days, Mr Xi’s absence from public view fueled speculation that he was trying to shield his own reputation by taking a back seat in the fast-unfolding crisis. In the past week, he has returned to centre stage in an apparent effort to swat away such talk. \n This past week, Mr Xi went to a neighbourhood centre in Beijing, a hospital and a centre for disease control in what state media billed as a visit to the “front line” of China’s efforts to combat the epidemic. He has yet to visit Hubei, the province at the centre of the epidemic. \n A few days later, Mr Xi fired two top Communist Party officials in Hubei, a move intended to calm simmering public anger and contain the political fallout. \n By publishing the Feb 3 speech now, experts said, Mr Xi appears to be staking his reputation on the outcome of the epidemic fight. \n “What’s really interesting in the speech is, there’s a lot of the word ‘I’ in it,” said Dr Blanchette, of Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “This is clearly putting himself at the centre of Beijing’s response to this while also falling back on the old excuse of blaming cadres for long-standing pathologies of China’s political system.” \n The Feb 3 speech was published by Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, the Communist Party’s top doctrinal journal. It is rare for such an internal speech to be published in full so quickly. THE NEW YORK TIMES \n "}, {"content": "Breakingviews - Breakdown: Coronavirus goes global. NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - It’s not time to panic, but it is time to face reality. The coronavirus is spreading around the world. China’s unprecedented efforts slowed the spread of the new disease officially known as Covid-19, but that’s merely won some time. Infected people have now been detected on every continent except Antarctica. Competent and open government is the best defense against hospitals and society being overwhelmed. But nations will probably have to deal with recurring outbreaks.\nNo. China helped reduce transmission by shutting down public gatherings, factories, and schools. Mass testing is also key to figure out who has the disease, and track who may have been exposed. China now claims the number of new cases is falling. While the country’s official statistics are notoriously unreliable, it makes sense such methods would slow the spread of the disease which has afflicted more than 78,000 people in the People’s Republic and killed around 2,700.\nWhile the World Health Organization has declined to call it a pandemic – a deadly disease which is spreading worldwide – the cat is out of the bag. Cases have been found in 50 countries, and the list is rapidly growing. On Wednesday the number of new cases reported outside China exceeded those inside the country for the first time since the disease was identified in early December.\nWhat’s especially alarming is that one of the first indications of a mass outbreak in Iran came from a traveler being diagnosed in Canada. If countries that appear uninfected are spreading the disease, many other outbreaks are presumably underway. Nearly every country neighboring Iran has now been affected.\nFor a disease to be truly worrisome, it needs to be both highly contagious and dangerous. Ebola has caused a lot of suffering in central Africa, but the disease often kills its victims before they can infect many others. The odds of it spreading widely are therefore low.\nBy comparison the 2009 flu – the last pandemic – spread all over the earth but was surprisingly mild. America’s Centers for Disease Control estimates over 60 million Americans were stricken. It swamped medical offices, workplaces were short-staffed, and schools emptied. But it only killed about one out of every 5,000 people who were infected.\nThe new coronavirus appears to spread easily. The experience of the Diamond Princess cruise ship suggests it can be explosive. Out of 3,700 passengers and crew, there have been about 700 confirmed cases and that number continues to rise. More broadly, cases outside China are more than doubling every week. It’s also dangerous. The estimated death rate for Covid-19 is about 2%, making it about 20 times deadlier than typical influenza.\nHealthcare systems aren’t designed to deal with pandemics, because they are so unusual. The United States has about 900,000 hospital beds, about two-thirds of which are occupied on average according to the CDC. The World Health Organization estimates about 80% of coronavirus cases are mild, with others serious or critical. So if just 1% of America’s population of 330 million contracted the virus at the same time, there wouldn’t be enough hospital beds. An uneven outbreak could lead to more overcrowding in some cities and critical-care units.\nHospitals would probably run short of protective gear. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has said the government has stockpiled 30 million masks, but it needs 300 million to protect front-line healthcare workers alone. Doctors would be overloaded, because many would become sick, and because people who have not been infected would still seek help.\nStretched medical systems will kill more patients. This dynamic helps explain why the death rate in the city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, has been higher than in other parts of China. Countries with poor medical care will be hit harder. They lack the ability to find clusters of disease and dampen the outbreak, while patients won’t be treated.\nClosed factories and housebound consumers have already depressed Chinese economic activity. Companies ranging from Apple to Yum China have warned of supply chain issues and decreased demand. These will cascade as more countries embrace drastic measures. Japan on Thursday closed all its schools early ahead of an upcoming spring break.\nIt’s notable that three of the four flu pandemics in the past century were followed shortly by U.S. recessions. The exception was the 2009 outbreak, which occurred when the world economy was already in the dumps. Closed factories and offices reduce output, restaurants and cinemas suffer revenue shortfalls, corporate debt weighs heavier, while small businesses may fail if the owner falls sick or dies.\nThe World Bank estimated in 2014 that a pandemic of similar size and effect to the 1918 flu would knock 5% off global gross domestic product. That disease was both widespread and probably more virulent – it killed over 50 million people – so that’s a worst-case scenario.\nAllowing information to flow freely is the best way to identify clusters early. When local officials cover up, or doctors are afraid to disclose cases, outbreaks fester. The epidemics in China and Iran probably would have been caught and acted upon earlier in less authoritarian countries.\nMeasures such as shutting down society or closing borders can slow transmission, but can’t be sustained for months on end. Democratic societies may not allow the kind of intensive surveillance China has practiced. Workers and businesses can only go so long before the financial crunch becomes unbearable. China is now revving back up, and that will almost certainly result in more infections.\nMass testing of the exposed and isolating the sick can be sustained and might keep clusters manageable. But this requires a functioning system with competent leadership. South Korea said on Wednesday that over 20,000 people were being tested. The United States has not started surveillance and has only been testing about a dozen people a day. That means undetected outbreaks are probably underway.\nPast pandemics have spread in waves. The virus may propagate more effectively when the weather is cold and dry. Behavior changes too; people wash their hands more often when evidence of sickness is around them. As the proportion of the population with immunity rises, the disease spreads more slowly. However, immunity may wane over time. The most likely outcome is that the disease becomes endemic with smaller outbreaks following the initial flare.\nSeveral anti-viral medicines and vaccines are already being tested. Showing efficacy, safety and scaling up production will take time, though. A drug to treat the coronavirus probably won’t be widely available for at least a year; developing a vaccine will take longer. In the meantime, the world can only prepare for the worst, while hoping for the best.\n"}, {"content": "hundreds of americans flown home from cruise ship, 14 with coronavirus. SHANGHAI/TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. - More than 300 American cruise liner passengers, including 14 who tested positive for coronavirus, were flown home to military bases in the United States, after two weeks under quarantine off Japan.  \n The cruise ship Diamond Princess, with more than 400 cases by far the largest cluster outside China, has become the biggest test so far of other countries' ability to contain an outbreak that has killed 1,770 people in China and five elsewhere.  \n Ground crew in anti-contamination suits met a chartered jet that touched down at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, and passengers could be seen climbing down the stairs wearing face masks in the pre-dawn mist. Another flight landed at Travis Air Force Base in California hours earlier. Those arriving were taken into a two-week quarantine.  \n Although U.S. officials said passengers with coronavirus symptoms would not be taken, 14 passengers found at the last minute to have tested positive were permitted to board the planes. The U.S. State Department said the infected passengers were kept in isolation on the flights.  \n Across mainland China, officials said the total number of coronavirus cases rose by 2,048 to 70,548. That was slightly more new cases than were reported on Sunday, but hundreds fewer than reported on Saturday.  \n Chinese authorities say the stabilisation in the number of new cases is a sign that measures they have taken to halt the spread of the disease are having an effect.  \n However, epidemiologists say it is probably still too early to say how well the outbreak is being contained within China and its central Hubei province, where the virus first appeared. Official figures of new cases have levelled off in the past, only to jump suddenly after changes in methodology.  \n China has responded to the COVID-19 virus by locking down Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, a megacity of 11 million people, and imposing restrictions in a number of other cities.  \n But the ruling Communist Party is also under pressure to prevent the economy from crashing and get people back to work.  \n China's central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending, a move that is expected to pave the way for a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday. Beijing has also announced plans for cuts in taxes and fees.  \n Even so, economists expect China's economic growth to slow. Ratings agency Moody's on Monday lowered its 2020 GDP growth forecast to 5.2%, making it likely China would miss a goal to double GDP over the decade to 2020.  \n  \n CRUISE SHIPS  \n Around half of all known cases of the virus outside China have been found aboard the Diamond Princess, where around 400 people have tested positive since the cruise liner was ordered to stay under quarantine off Japan on Feb. 3.  \n Several other countries have announced plans to follow the United States in bringing passengers home. Around half of the 3,700 passengers and crew are Japanese.  \n Matthew Smith, an American passenger who remained on the ship after refusing to board the voluntary repatriation flights, tweeted that staying behind was the \"best decision ever\".  \n \"US Gov't said they would not put anyone on the planes who was symptomatic, and they ended up knowingly and intentionally putting on 14 people who actually have the virus,\" he wrote.  \n Authorities around the world were also trying to track down passengers from another cruise liner, the Westerdam, which was turned away from ports across Southeast Asia for two weeks before docking in Cambodia on Thursday.  \n One American passenger who disembarked in Cambodia tested positive for the virus in Malaysia on Saturday.  \n Carnival Corp., which operates both cruise liners, said it was cooperating with authorities in trying to trace other passengers from the Westerdam. None of the other 1,454 passengers and 802 crew had reported any symptoms, it said.  \n \"Guests who have already returned home will be contacted by their local health department and be provided further information,\" a statement from the company's Holland America Line unit said. Hundreds of passengers are still in Cambodia, either on the ship or in hotels.  \n \"We will all be tested for the coronavirus today and tomorrow by the Cambodian Ministry of Health,\" said passenger Holley Rauen, a public health nurse and midwife from Fort Myers, Florida. \"We have no idea when we get to get home.\"  \n  \n CHINA BACK TO WORK?  \n After an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China needs to get back to work or suffer severe economic consequences. There is a proposal to delay the opening of the annual session of parliament, due on Feb. 24.  \n Some cities remain in lockdown, streets are deserted, employees are nervous, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country. Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond.  \n In Japan, where data showed on Monday that the economy had already shrunk last quarter at the fastest pace in almost six years, the impact of the virus is expected to show up in the current quarter, stoking fears of recession.  \n Trade-dependent Singapore downgraded its 2020 economic growth forecast and has said recession is possible. It is set to unveil measures to cushion the blow on Tuesday.  \n Organisers of the Tokyo Marathon have decided to limit the March 1 race to top-level athletes, banning 38,000 general participants, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters.  \n Japan's Imperial Household Agency said it would cancel Emperor Naruhito's public birthday address on Feb. 23, his first since his coronation last year. The event regularly attracts tens of thousands of people to the inner grounds of the Imperial Palace in the heart of Tokyo.

China put on lockdown on Thursday two cities at the epicentre of a new coronavirus outbreak that has killed 17 people and infected nearly 600, as health authorities around the world scramble to prevent a global pandemic.\nHealth officials fear the transmission rate will accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad during week-long holidays for the Lunar New Year, which begins on Saturday.\nThe previously unknown virus strain is believed to have emerged late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.\nMost transport in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, was suspended on Thursday morning and people were told not to leave. Hours later, state media in neighbouring Huanggang, a city of some 6 million people, said it was imposing a similar lockdown.\nChinese authorities gave no new details on the numbers of virus infections but it has been reported in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, and several other countries including the United States, stoking fears it is already spreading worldwide.\nWuhan's city government said it would shut down all urban transport networks and suspend outgoing flights from 10 a.m. (0200 GMT). Domestic media said some airlines were operating after the deadline, however. State media broadcast images of one of Wuhan's transport hubs, the Hankou rail station, nearly deserted, with gates blocked or barred. The government is urging citizens not to leave the city.\nState media reported highway toll booths around Wuhan were closing down, which would effectively cut off road exits. Guards were patrolling major highways, one resident told Reuters.\nAs the city slipped into isolation, residents thronged into hospitals for checks and scrambled for supplies, clearing out supermarket shelves and queuing for petrol.\nAuthorities in Huanggang ordered indoor entertainment venues including cinemas and internet cafes to close and were asking citizens not to leave other than under special circumstances, state media said.\nAuthorities had confirmed 571 cases and 17 deaths by the end of Wednesday, China's National Health Commission said. Earlier, it said another 393 suspected cases had been reported.\nOf eight known cases worldwide, Thailand has confirmed four, while Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States have reported one each.\nIn a report on Wednesday, Imperial College London said it estimated a total of 4,000 cases of the coronavirus in Wuhan alone as of Jan. 18, an infection rate based on the number of cases reported in China and elsewhere.\nVIRUS SPREADING In contrast with its secrecy over the 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that killed nearly 800 people, China's communist government has provided regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the holidays.\nDuring a visit to Wuhan, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said authorities needed to be open about the virus and efforts to contain it, the official Xinhua news agency said.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has said it will decide on Thursday whether to declare the outbreak a global health emergency, which would step up the international response.\nIf it does so, it will be the sixth international public health emergency to be declared in the last decade.\nSome experts believe the new virus is not as dangerous as previous coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which has killed more than 700 people since 2012.\n\"The early evidence at this stage would suggest it's not as severe,\" Australia's Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy told reporters.\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva that China's actions were \"very strong\" but called on it to take \"more and significant measures to limit or minimise the international spread\".\n\"We stressed to them that by having a strong action not only they will control the outbreak in their country but they will also minimise the chances of this outbreak spreading internationally. So they recognise that,\" he said.\nDespite China's response, stock markets across Asia were on the back foot on Thursday, led by drops of roughly 1.5% in Hong Kong and Shanghai while China's yuan fell to a two-week low.\nThere is no vaccine for the virus, which can spread through respiratory transmission. Symptoms include fever, difficulty in breathing and cough, similar to many other respiratory illnesses.\nPreliminary research suggested the virus was passed on to humans from snakes, but government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan has also identified badgers and rats as possible sources. Confirmed sufferers include 15 medical workers.\nMany Chinese were cancelling trips, buying face masks and avoiding cinemas and shopping centres, and even turning to an online plague simulation game as a way to cope.\nThe release of seven movies over the Lunar New Year has been postponed. The holiday is the high season for distributors and cinemas attract huge crowds.\nAirports globally stepped up screening of passengers from China and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said the further global spread of the virus was likely.\n\"Obviously this is a huge concern for the world,\" Britain's business minister, Andrea Leadsom, told Sky.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus death toll soars to 132 in China, confirmed infections about 6,000.

They are the most primitive and most effective methods,\" he said.\nZhong said fever and weakness were the typical symptoms of the novel coronavirus infection found in the majority of patients.\nTen to 14 days is a sound period for isolation and observation. When the incubation period ends, those who fall sick will get timely treatment and those who do not will be just fine, he said.\nHe suggested that hospitals be staffed with not only infectious disease specialists, but also specialists in treating severe cases to better save patients.\nEpidemiologically, the novel coronavirus is homologous to the virus discovered in a type of bat in 2017, said Zhong, adding that the 2019-nCoV probably has an intermediate host that may be a certain kind of wild animal.\n\"The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak lasted about six months, but I don't believe the novel coronavirus outbreak would last that long,\" said Zhong.\nThe country has taken a series of powerful measures, especially early detection and early isolation.\n\"We have sufficient confidence in preventing a major outbreak or a recurrence as long as the two measures are in place, although we still need to conduct much scientific research,\" he said.\nNoting that the key for Wuhan is how to reduce infections inside hospitals, Zhong said he supported the construction of makeshift hospitals in the city to control the infectious disease.\nThe activation of top-level public health emergency response was aimed at reducing the chance of infection, he said, adding that the vaccine development may need three to four months or even longer.\n\"Now scientists are speeding up research of neutralizing antibodies of the virus, but it takes time. With help from across the country, Wuhan, a heroic city, will pull through,\" Zhong said.\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday called the coronavirus a \"demon\" which should be brought under control.\nChina has ramped up efforts to contain the virus.

A Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) elevou o risco de contágio e de impacto do novo coronavírus a “muito alto a nível global”. Em conferência de imprensa, o director-geral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus afirmou que o surto que já afectava nesta sexta-feira perto de 60 países está a aumentar. Com muitas perguntas ainda sem resposta, a principal preocupação dos vários países é tentar travar a transmissão do vírus e encontrar uma possível cura ou tratamento específico.\nGhebreyesus disse que seria um “grande, grande erro” abandonar a estratégia de mitigação do novo coronavírus, acrescentando que cada país deve fazer “uma contenção agressiva”. O director-geral da OMS adiantou ainda que estão a ser desenvolvidas mais de 20 vacinas e que há já alguns ensaios clínicos a decorrer. Esperam resultados nas próximas semanas. \n23 milhões de orçamento extra\nA Alemanha soma desde o início da crise 48 casos (até esta sexta-feira), dos quais 18 já recuperam. Não havia até esta tarde registo de mortes. O Ministério da Saúde alemão tem no seu site informação permanentemente actualizada. Foi criado um orçamento especial para lidar com o surto: 23 milhões de euros para medidas de prevenção, de comunicação e repatriamento de cidadãos, entre outras. Em matéria de prevenção as regras são estas: as pessoas que tenham estado em países ou zonas de risco (a identificação das mesmas cabe, na Alemanha, ao Robert Koch Institute) devem evitar, “independentemente de terem sintomas”, contactos “desnecessários” com outras pessoas e devem “permanecer em casa sempre que possível”. Se desenvolverem sintomas devem ir ao médico, tendo o cuidado de o avisar antes, por telefone, fornecendo informação sobre os países visitados, prossegue o ministério. São consideradas zonas de risco: China, Coreia do Sul, Irão e Itália.\nOs passageiros que vêm da China, Hong Kong e Macau têm, ainda no avião, de preencher um documento com informação sobre onde vão ficar nos 30 dias seguintes na Alemanha, dando os seus contactos para que possam ser encontrados casos surja algum caso entre os que viajaram juntos. Têm também de informar em que locais exactos estiveram na China e em que condições de saúde se encontram. Toda a informação dos viajantes deve ser disponibilizada pelas companhias aéreas às autoridades de saúde alemãs. Os pilotos dos aviões têm instruções para antes de aterrarem comunicarem o estado de saúde dos passageiros. Algum caso suspeito deve ser comunicado para que no aeroporto esteja um médico que deve entrar no avião, examinar o viajante em causa e decidir o que fazer. As mesmas regras devem ser aplicadas nos comboios e autocarros que atravessem fronteiras terrestres.\nA Alemanha vai “continuar a tentar isolar as pessoas, o máximo possível, tratá-las em clínicas e providenciar cuidados a possíveis pessoas de contacto”, disse esta semana o ministro da Saúde, Jens Spahn. Já houve medidas de precaução, como o encerramento de escolas e creches numa cidade, Heinsberg, na Renânia do Norte-Vestfália, cujas autoridades ordenaram a quarentena doméstica para todas as pessoas (entre 300 e 400, segundo os diferentes meios de comunicação social) que participaram num evento de Carnaval este mês. A estas pessoas podem ser pedidas amostras de sangue. Isto depois de ter sido confirmado que um casal que esteve nessa festa está infectado. Outros casos, 14 no total, confirmados na quinta-feira em Heinsberg, não precisam de hospitalização mas permanecem isolados em suas casas. \nPessoas sem sintomas devem levar uma “vida normal\"\nO Governo espanhol recomenda vida normal para todas as pessoas, mesmo aquelas regressadas de zonas de risco. Espanha registou até às 16h25 de ontem 34 casos positivos, sendo que dois destes já tiveram alta. Apenas um homem de 77 anos se encontrava em estado grave. E mesmo com estes casos todos confirmados, as recomendações são semelhantes às que existem em Portugal.\nQuem chega de zonas de risco, que Espanha considera serem as de China continental, Singapura, Hong-Kong, Japão, Coreia do Sul, Irão e Itália (regiões de Lombardia, Veneto, Emilia-Romana e Piamonte) e está de boa saúde deve levar uma “vida normal, em família, com amigos e, em geral, no espaço escolar e laboral”. Se nos 14 dias após a chegada desenvolverem sintomas respiratórios como febre, tosse e sensação de falta de ar, “devem permanecer no domicílio e contactar os serviços de saúde” através da linha telefónica espanhola que existe para o efeito.\nEm relação a viagens para zonas de risco, o Governo espanhol recomenda “não viajar para as zonas afectadas a não ser que seja estritamente necessário”.\nNão há medidas de quarentena activas em Espanha neste momento. Houve uma situação num hotel em Tenerife onde estavam identificados casos positivos, mas essas pessoas já saíram do hotel e regressaram às suas casas.\nO departamento de Saúde Pública espanhol mantém o \"nível um” de contenção, de três níveis possíveis. E apenas pondera elevar este nível, o que pode levar a medidas mais apertadas, caso se verifique “uma transmissão comunitária descontrolada”. Nesse caso, os espanhóis colocarão a hipótese de optar por “medidas de distanciamento social básicas como reduzir aglomerações de pessoas”. Mas, para já, este é só um cenário hipotético.\nMilhares de quarentena\nO balanço nesta sexta-feira do Ministério da Saúde italiano era este: 888 infectados até agora, 21 mortos, perto de 50 pessoas recuperadas. Foi criado um site especial onde a informação sobre coronavírus é actualizada diariamente. Aí se recorda o decreto de 21 de Fevereiro que manda, por exemplo, que todas as pessoas que tenham estado recentemente em áreas da China afectadas pela epidemia são obrigadas a comunicar esse facto às autoridades de saúde. Estabelece-se ainda que devem ficar em casa de quarentena e que, em caso de recusa, serão “adoptadas medidas com eficácia semelhante”. Desde 30 de Janeiro que estão suspensos os voos para a China continental, Macau, Hong Kong e Taiwan, por ordem do ministro da Saúde. Há ainda medidas específicas em diferentes regiões.\nDesde que o Norte de Itália se tornou o foco número um na Europa que o país tem tomado medidas drásticas. Onze cidades com um total de 55 mil pessoas estão em quarentena. Escolas, universidades e cinemas foram fechados e vários eventos públicos cancelados, como por exemplo os festejos oficiais do Carnaval de Veneza ou a Feira do Livro de Bolonha. A região italiana da Lombardia anunciou nesta sexta-feira que vai estender por mais uma semana as medidas de emergência adoptadas para tentar conter o surto do novo coronavírus que afecta a região – incluindo o fecho de escolas e proibição de ajuntamentos públicos.\nUma habitante de San Fiorano, uma das cidades de quarentena, contou nesta sexta-feira à BBC que já não é obrigatório usar máscara nos supermercados, que a situação está calma, mas que as ruas permanecem quase desertas. Voluntários garantem o fornecimento de alimentos e medicamentos às pessoas mais velhas (ou doentes) que não conseguem sair de casa.\nPara “evitar a suspensão” de empresas e centros de produção, o decreto de 21 de Fevereiro permite que empresas e funcionários optem pelo “trabalho remoto” até 15 de Março em seis regiões do Norte da Itália (mas as empresas podem rejeitar a medida “por motivos organizacionais”). Funcionários da administração pública italiana também podem recorrer a esse tipo de trabalho. \nLicença para pais ficarem com filhos\nEm França, medidas de precaução incluíram o cancelamento de eventos como o carnaval de Nice e uma feira comercial internacional em Paris.\nO Governo decidiu suspender todas as viagens escolares para e das zonas onde o vírus circula: China continental, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapura, Coreia do Sul e as regiões italianas da Lombardia e de Véneto. As crianças e jovens que regressem dessas zonas não devem ir à escola durante os 14 dias seguintes. Os pais dessas crianças beneficiarão de uma licença paga de 20 dias mediante um certificado médico.\nNo caso dos adultos trabalhadores, o Governo determina que durante os 14 dias subsequentes ao regresso das zonas de risco essas pessoas trabalhem a partir de casa caso estejam bem de saúde. Mas se for determinado o seu isolamento ou se tiverem de permanecer no domicílio recebem de imediato uma indemnização referente a 20 dias de trabalho. \nOs franceses aconselham todas as pessoas que regressam de zonas de risco a usarem uma máscara. O uso da máscara só é recomendado nestes casos ou se as pessoas estiverem doentes.\nNos aeroportos Paris-Charles de Gaulle e Saint-Denis de la Réunion os passageiros vindos da China, Hong-Kong e Macau são recebidos por uma equipa da Protecção Civil que está em contacto com o serviço médico dos aeroportos em causa.\nRecomendações para quem estiver isolado em casa\nCerca de nove mil pessoas foram testadas até esta sexta-feira, no Reino Unido, mas apenas 20 casos foram positivos, segundo o Ministério da Saúde num comunicado desta sexta-feira.\nO Governo tem avisado para os perigos de reagir de modo exagerado em resposta a uma epidemia e está a aumentar o número de testes mesmo a pessoas que não tenham viajado para as zonas de risco em Itália, Irão ou China, e que não tenham sintomas. As orientações oficiais são para que quem regressou de 11 cidades italianas em quarentena fique em isolamento em casa. O mesmo se aplica a que chegou nos últimos dias do Irão e certas zonas da Coreia do Sul. Evitar contactar outras pessoas e telefonar para as linhas do Serviço Nacional de Saúde são as recomendações. Mas medidas como o encerramento de fronteiras estão por agora afastadas. “Se virem o caso de Itália, eles pararam todos os voos vindos da China e são agora o país mais afectado da Europa”, declarou o secretário de Estado da Saúde, Matt Hancock esta semana.\nJá quem apresenta sintomas deve permanecer em casa, isolado, enquanto não tem os resultados dos exames. Há uma série de recomendações para estas pessoas (por exemplo, há cuidados especiais a ter com o lixo doméstico destes doentes que deve ser devidamente embalado e não colocado no exterior para recolha até que haja a certeza de que a pessoa não está infectada; as pessoas devem manter-se num quarto com janela para o exterior e porta fechada...).\nA 10 de Fevereiro o Governo anunciou o “reforço dos poderes legais para proteger a saúde pública”. E é possível ordenar o isolamento de indivíduos se houver fundamentada razão para tal. Há monitorização de passageiros nos aeroportos (para quem vem da China), uma equipa especial foi colocada no aeroporto de Heathrow para apoiar quem chegue e não se sinta bem, para além dos médicos que estão em permanência em todos os aeroportos do país.\nNa quinta feita uma escola fechou em Derbyshire depois de confirmado um caso entre os encarregados de educação. Um centro médico foi igualmente fechado, não muito longe, por causa de outro caso confirmado, noticiou a BBC.\nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\nO primeiro doente em isolamento\nNesta quinta-feira foi identificado o primeiro caso do novo coronavírus na Holanda, confirmou o Instituto Holandês de Saúde Pública e Meio Ambiente. É de um homem que esteve recentemente na região italiana da Lombardia.

As of March 28, less than three months after the world was made aware of the novel coronavirus, 600,000 people across 177 countries/regions have been infected with it. The infection which reportedly originated from a market in Wuhan city in the Chinese province of Hubei, has claimed more than 27,800 lives.\nWith nations entering lockdown in an effort to 'flatten the curve' of social interactions by means of social distancing, it is very important to refrain from placing one's beliefs in any miraculous cures or conspiracy theories about COVID-19. Here are some widely shared myths about the novel coronavirus that stand nowhere on the scale of scientific relevance.\nThis is a myth. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has observed that this infection can be transmitted in any and all areas regardless of climate.\nThis is not true. While wearing a mask in a crowded place is advisable, the mask cannot prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus. In some cases where the person wearing the mask touches an infected surface before touching his/her face to re-adjust the mask, this protective gear could lead to infection, said the Director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria.\nThis is a myth. The normal body temperature remains stable between 36.5°C to 37°C despite the temperature of one's bath, says the WHO.\nThere is no evidence whatsoever to prove this claim. While alcohol-based hand sanitizers are a recommended precaution against any virus, drinking alcohol while seeking to cure Covid-19 is the same as drinking alcohol-based hand sanitizer and expecting it to taste like a pint of beer.\nIt has been established that the novel coronavirus jumped species from an animal to a man and is originally a zoonotic disease. However, no known animal species has been known to carry this virus as of yet and medical experts have asked people not to believe in rumours and eat non-vegetarian meals as long as they are prepared with utmost care for hygiene.\nThis is a myth. Dr Faheem Younus, the Chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Maryland says that a person infected with the novel coronavirus can also hold his/her breath for longer than 10 seconds. On the other hand, the elderly will not be able to accomplish this task but it does not in any way mean that they are infected.\nDirector of AIIMS, Dr Randeep Guleria says that one should not visit a hospital during a pandemic since it increases the chances of a healthy person catching the virus. One should consult a doctor over the phone if he/she is experiencing any symptoms at all and seek future course of action.\nThis is a myth. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the consumption of garlic boosts the immunity system or safeguards one from being infected with Covid-19.\nThis is untrue. One should not donate blood at a time like this unless and until one is absolutely sure that he/she is not infected.\nThis is a myth. No study or research has shown that mosquitoes can act as carriers of the novel coronavirus. \"The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose,\" says WHO.\nThese are myths. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one should regularly wash one's hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Apart from this, neither a hand dryer nor an ultraviolet disinfection lamp can kill the virus.\nThis is a myth. Pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine cannot protect anyone from Covid-19 since the vaccine for the new coronavirus is yet to be discovered.\nThis is untrue. While some preliminary research has shown that the novel coronavirus remains on certain surfaces such as cardboard for some time, it cannot spread through parcels received from China.\nThis is not entirely true. A thermal scanner detects body temperature and is great for identifying someone with a high fever, however, medical experts and doctors treating Covid-19 patients have said that initial research shows how people who display no symptoms can also be infected with the virus.\nThis is untrue. The transmission of novel coronavirus has been seen in people of all ages. Doctors suggest that people with co-morbid conditions such as blood pressure, heart or respiratory diseases are at a higher risk if they get infected with Covid-19. However, a perfectly healthy person can also be infected in the presence of a Covid-19 patient.\n"}, {"content": "novel coronavirus outbreak raises spectre of sars. Many have drawn parallels between the current novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2002 and 2003. \n It would be difficult not to. \n Both outbreaks are caused by novel animal coronaviruses that ended up infecting humans. Both originated in China, can cause severe human disease and have resulted in deaths. Both have been declared “public health emergencies of international concern” by the World Health Organization (WHO). \n But there are significant differences between the two outbreaks and let’s guard against seeing the 2019-nCoV from an old lens. \n First, let’s consider why Sars is deeply entrenched in many Singaporeans’ psyche. \n The Sars outbreak was a seminal event for Singapore and its healthcare system in particular. While the 238 cases and 33 deaths here between March and July 2003 may seem small when compared to most other serious medical conditions, Sars caused considerable fear and uncertainty among the people, with outsized economic and public health impact. \n These include the ramifications from the closure of Tan Tock Seng Hospital — a large general hospital — to non-Sars patients for almost three months. \n Then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong described the Sars epidemic as a “defining moment” for Singapore. \n While WHO had praised Singapore for its exemplary handling of the epidemic, the outbreak also highlighted how unprepared our country was for a novel respiratory virus outbreak. \n In its aftermath, fundamental changes to hospitals and outbreak management in our country were made that have been extensively described elsewhere. \n As a result, Singapore is now far more prepared for 2019-nCoV and other epidemics compared to 2003. \n The collective psychological impact and institutional memory of Sars has meant that we have a tendency to view each new epidemic through the lens of the Sars experience. \n When the pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus appeared on the horizon in April 2009, the initial planning in Singapore that I could observe revolved around containing the disease — early detection of infected persons for hospitalisation and prolonged isolation, as well as quarantining their contacts. \n This was triggered when the first patient in Singapore was diagnosed in May 2009. \n However, the pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus — like all influenza viruses — is a markedly different beast compared to the Sars coronavirus (Sars-CoV). \n It spreads far more easily in the community, and poses a far lower risk of death. \n Fewer than one per thousand will die after being infected by influenza compared to slightly more than one in 10 persons infected with Sars. \n What this means is that pandemic influenza could never have been contained in Singapore, but the consequences of failing was not dire. \n The Ministry of Health (MOH) stepped down control measures for the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus over a short few months and changed its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition alert level to green (normal) in February 2010, by which time an estimated several hundred thousand had been infected by flu. \n Doctors and public health professionals also believe the influence A (H1N1)pdm09 virus caused more deaths than Sars. \n Did the initial measures slow down the spread of the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus in Singapore sufficiently so that the healthcare system was not overwhelmed and people had time to be socialised to the idea that the pandemic was not worse than the usual seasonal flu? \n We do not know the answers to these questions. \n Fast forward to today, and it is clear now that there are crucial differences between Sars and the current coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan as well. \n During its approximate nine-month course, Sars infected 8,096 persons — 5,327 in mainland China — and resulted in 774 deaths. \n A significant proportion of its spread occurred in hospitals (40.8 per cent in Singapore). Within a third of that time, the 2019-nCoV has infected as of Feb 3 over 16,000 persons — more than 98 per cent of whom are in China — and resulted in over 300 deaths. \n Almost the entirety of its spread has been in the community. Part of the heightened case count is due to timing. \n The Wuhan outbreak occurred just before Chinese New Year, a period where the largest human migration on earth occurs. \n The world is also far more connected today than in 2003. However, it is also apparent now that the novel coronavirus is more infectious than the Sars-CoV, with several family or travel clusters among those diagnosed overseas. \n Asymptomatic infections have been reported, which did not happen with Sars-CoV, with Germany reporting a plausible case of asymptomatic transmission of the virus. \n The silver lining is that the 2019-nCoV appears far less deadly compared to the Sars-CoV. \n The case fatality rate of the 2019-nCoV is currently estimated to be around 2 per cent (i.e. 2 out of every 100 infected will die), although the actual figure might be lower depending on the number of persons with mild disease who did not present to a healthcare facility and were thus undiagnosed. \n So currently the 2019-nCoV is shaping up to look less like Sars-CoV, and more like a virulent form of the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, although more data is required before we can be completely certain. \n One important lesson is that the initial information obtained at the start of epidemics is incomplete and can be misleading. \n In early January 2020, there was little to suggest that the 2019-nCoV was different from the Sars and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses in terms of how it spreads and the severity of infection. \n Similarly, the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus was initially believed to be as deadly as the Spanish flu of 1918, which was estimated to have wiped out between 3 and 5 per cent of the human population. \n Within a few short weeks, however, sufficient information became available for a more concrete re-assessment in both 2009 and 2020. \n We do not know at present whether the 2019-nCoV epidemic can be contained. \n China has instituted incredible control measures — in effect virtually quarantining an entire province — that would be unthinkable anywhere else in the world. \n However, the virus has already spread to more than 25 countries worldwide, including several that will not be able to mount as robust a response as China and other high-income countries should community spread occur. \n It is likely that the threat of 2019-nCoV will be present far longer than the nine months of Sars, while an effective vaccine will take far longer than a year to become commercially available. \n It is useful to look at the 2019-nCoV outbreak not through the lens of Sars, but entirely on its own characteristics and calibrate measures and policies towards minimising impact and living life as normally as possible during this period. \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR:   \n Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang heads the Infectious Diseases Programme and is co-director of the Leadership Institute for Global Health Transformation at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore. \n "}, {"content": "budget 2020: s$5.6 billion special packages to support firms, workers and households amid covid-19 outbreak. SINGAPORE — Amid expectations of a substantial package to help Singapore cope with the Covid-19 outbreak, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat unveiled during this year’s Budget statement not one, but two special packages totalling S$5.6 billion to help firms and workers, as well as households. \n The packages dwarf the S$230 million package introduced during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003, and significantly exceed analysts’ expectations. \n They comprise a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package which will “stabilise the economy and support our workers and enterprises”, as Mr Heng put it, and a S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package to help households with cost of living. \n The special packages come on the back of lacklustre economic growth last year — 0.7 per cent, the weakest since the 2008 global financial crisis. \n On Monday, the Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its economic growth forecast to between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, down from 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. \n In his Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18), Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, noted that Covid-19 hit Singapore “just as the global economy was beginning to recover”. \n “The outbreak will certainly impact our economy,” said Mr Heng, adding that this is especially so since Singapore’s economy is now much more integrated with the economy of China, where the virus originated.  \n The Government is monitoring the situation and it is ready to do more if necessary to help Singaporeans cope with the economic impact, Mr Heng reiterated.  \n Comprising broad-based measures, the two packages will also feature targeted support, with the less well-off and industries more impacted by the outbreak getting more help. \n   \n  \n BROAD-BASED HELP FOR FIRMS, WORKERS  \n JOBS SUPPORT SCHEME  \n Under the Stabilisation and Support Package, a S$1.3 billion Jobs Support Scheme will be rolled out to benefit all enterprises and their local employees which total more than 1.9 million people. The Government will pay for 8 per cent of the wages of these workers, up to a monthly cap of S$3,600 for three months, said Mr Heng. \n This scheme will help businesses retain Singapore workers and will be given to employers by the end of July. The measures are directed toward Singaporean citizens and permanent residents, as well as both full-time and part-time hires. \n ENHANCED WAGE CREDIT SCHEME \n The Wage Credit Scheme currently co-funds wage increases for Singaporean employees earning a gross monthly wage of up to S$4,000. \n The cap will be raised to S$5,000 for qualifying wage increases given in 2019 and 2020. The Government will also co-fund five percentage points more, raising the levels to 20 per cent for wage raises in 2019 and 15 per cent for those in 2020. \n The enhancement will cost the Government another S$1.1 billion, benefitting 90,000 enterprises and more than 700,000 Singaporean employees, Mr Heng said. \n OTHER INITIATIVES  \n A corporate income tax rebate at the rate of 25 per cent of tax payable, capped at S$15,000 per firm, will also help all tax-paying companies in Singapore. This will cost the Government S$400 million. \n “We will also support tenants and lessees of government-managed properties,” said Mr Heng. \n Tenants and lessees under the JTC Corporation, the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Singapore Land Authority, the Singapore Tourism Board and the Sentosa Development Corporation will receive help with rent, including more flexible rental payments. \n Firms can apply to the relevant agencies which will assess each request individually. \n Several tax treatments under the corporate tax system will also be enhanced for one year, such as allowing a faster write-down of investments in plant and machinery, renovation, and refurbishment under the 2021 year of assessment. \n “This will put more cash in the hands of our enterprises. For example, hotels can now take advantage of this lull period to carry out upgrading work, and be better prepared for the rebound,” said Mr Heng. \n To help enterprises access working capital more easily, the working capital loan component under the Enterprise Financing Scheme will be boosted for one year, with the maximum loan quantum doubled to S$600,000. \n The Government will also bear greater risks for these loans, with its share of risk upped to 80 per cent from the current range of 50 to 70 per cent. \n “With the large part of the risk taken up by the Government, I trust that our financial institutions will do their part to support our viable SMEs (small- and medium-sized enterprises),” said Mr Heng. \n TARGETED HELP FOR SECTORS DIRECTLY HIT BY OUTBREAK  \n Additional help will be given to sectors directly affected by the outbreak — tourism, aviation, food services and retail, as well as point-to-point transport sectors. \n These sectors will be given help to retain and reskill workers. The funding period for reskilling workers through redeployment programmes under the Manpower Ministry’s Adapt and Grow initiative will be increased to a maximum of six months. \n Said Mr Heng: “Together with the Jobs Support Scheme, we will support employers in these sectors to retain and train more than 330,000 local workers. These workers can make full use of the down time for training and upskilling to prepare for the recovery.” \n For the tourism sector, a property tax rebate of 30 per cent will be granted this year to accommodation and function room components of licensed hotels and serviced apartments, as well as venues for Mice (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions). \n International cruise and regional ferry terminals will receive a 15 per cent property tax rebate, while integrated resorts will get a 10 per cent tax rebate. \n A temporary bridging loan programme for the tourism sector will also be rolled out for a year, with a loan quantum of up to S$1 million and interest rates capped at 5 per cent. The Government will also bear 80 per cent of the risk of the loan. \n The aviation sector will benefit from a range of measures, including a 15 per cent property tax rebate for Changi Airport, as well as rebates on aircraft landing and parking charges, assistance for ground handling agents and rental rebates for shops and cargo agents at Changi Airport. \n A Transport Ministry spokesperson said that the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on Singapore’s aviation industry has been significant, with more than 80 per cent of all scheduled flights between Singapore and mainland China cancelled. \n “There are now fewer than 80 services per week, compared with over 400 prior to the outbreak. Passenger traffic has dropped,” said the spokesperson, who added that traffic to Singapore from other regions has also started to decline. \n Food services and retail businesses will also receive rental waivers or rebates. Tenants at National Environment Agency-managed hawker centres and markets will get a full-month of rent waived, and other Government agencies such as HDB will provide a half-month rent waiver to their commercial tenants. \n Those that operate out of private properties will also not be left out — landlords will be granted a 15 per cent property tax rebate for commercial properties that qualify. \n “I strongly urge landlords to pass this on to their tenants by reducing rentals,” Mr Heng said. \n For the point-to-point transport sector, which include taxi operators and private hire car firms, Mr Heng noted that the Transport Ministry had recently announced a support package for these businesses. Many firms in this sector have come forward to support the initiative by matching the Government’s contribution, he added. \n Said Mr Heng: “This spirit of partnership is what we need to weather this challenging period together.” \n More details of the various measures will be revealed in the upcoming debates into the respective ministries’ budgets. \n Mr Heng added that he will elaborate on the S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package in the later part of his speech. \n S$800M BOOST FOR FRONTLINE AGENCIES \n Separately, apart from the two special packages, another S$800 million will be injected to support the frontline agencies dealing with the outbreak. The bulk of the amount will be channelled to the Ministry of Health. \n “This is on top of the substantial resources already committed each year to public health,” said Mr Heng, who then thanked all frontline officers who have been working tirelessly to fight against the outbreak — prompting other members of the House to thump their armrests in support.  \n Paying tribute to the group, he said: “You exemplify the resilience and indomitable spirit of our people. But please take care of yourselves. I am confident that together, we will stay strong and get through these trying times.” \n "}, {"content": "Malaysia's fourth-quarter GDP growth seen slowing to weakest in 3-1\\/2 years: Reuters poll. KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia’s economic growth in the fourth quarter is expected to have slowed to its weakest since mid-2016 on weaker private consumption and external demand, a Reuters poll showed.\nThe median forecast from the poll of 13 economists was for growth of 4.2% in October-December compared with a year earlier, the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2016. That will be down from 4.4% in the third quarter and 4.9% in April-June.\nIndividual forecasts ranged from 3.4% to 4.6%.\nEconomic growth in Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy over the fourth quarter was likely weighed down by weakness in industrial production and exports, and slowing retail sales, according to Gareth Leather, senior asia economist with economic research consultancy Capital Economics.\n“Overall, we are penciling in growth of 4.0% y/y, down from 4.4% in Q3,” Leather said in a research note on Friday.\nFactory output in December grew 1.3% from a year earlier, below expectations and slower than the 2.0% expansion from the previous month.

Begibt man sich in diesen Tagen in die Abgründe der rechten bis rechtsextremen US-Medienlandschaft, wirkt es, als hätten deren Propagandisten auf ein Ereignis wie die Corona-Pandemie nur gewartet. Ben Shapiro, Chefredakteur der Website Daily Wire und Podcaster, warnte vor ein paar Tagen in seiner Show davor, dass in Zukunft \"alle vier, fünf Jahre\" ein Virus in China ausbrechen werde und es deshalb keineswegs rassistisch sei, wenn Donald Trump das Coronavirus \"das chinesische Virus\" nenne. Eine Woche zuvor hat der ultrakonservative Radiomoderator Rush Limbaugh in seiner Sendung gesagt: \"Nichts geht über die Vernichtung der gesamten US-Wirtschaft durch eine Biobedrohung aus China, oder?\"\nUnd dann wäre da noch Stephen Bannon, Trumps ehemaliger Chefstratege und Ex-Chef der White-Supremacy-Plattform Breitbart. In seinem Podcast War Room, den Bannon seit Oktober vergangenen Jahres führt, dreht sich seit Ende Januar fast alles um Corona, Bannon hat dafür ein eigenes Format etabliert, dessen Titel nach Action Game klingt, War Room: Pandemic. Als die Epidemie in der chinesischen Provinz Hubei ihren Anfang nahm, spekulierte Bannon mit seinen Gästen darüber, dass das Virus in einem geheimen Biowaffenprogramm in der dortigen Provinzhauptstadt Wuhan entstanden sei (diese Verschwörungstheorie ist längst als eine solche erkannt und widerlegt). Dann behauptete er, die Weltgesundheitsorganisation sei von China gekauft. In einer anderen Episode sagte Bannon, der seit Jahren von einem bevorstehenden Krieg im südchinesischen Meer fantasiert, dass Chinas Kommunistische Partei mit den gleichen Methoden wie Hitler und Goebbels arbeite.\nBannons Verschwörungstheorien sind grotesk. Er mag sich nach seinem kurzen Gastspiel im Weißen Haus und damit in der Nähe der Macht mittlerweile wieder zu einem politischen Außenseiter entwickelt haben, einem Clown eigentlich. Das ändert jedoch nichts daran, dass Figuren wie er in den USA ein Millionenpublikum besitzen. Bannon wurde in den letzten Wochen mehrfach in Sendungen des Trump-Lieblingssenders eingeladen, des Nachrichtenkanals Fox News. Und sollte stimmen, was das Magazin New York im Januar berichtete, dann wird sein Podcast auch von Mitarbeitern des Weißen Haus gehört. Zwei Jahre nachdem Trump den von ihm später \"Sloppy Steve\" getauften Bannon aus seinem Team schmiss, wirkt es fast so, als würden sich die beiden langsam wieder annähern.\nDonald Trump ist nicht nur Sender, er ist mehr als jeder seiner Vorgänger auch bereitwilliger Empfänger medialer Botschaften. Wer nachvollziehen möchte, was Trump wann warum sagt – das ist gar keine neue Erkenntnis –, muss eigentlich nur das tun, was Trump selbst am liebsten tut: Fox News schauen. Der reichweitenstärkste Nachrichtensender der USA setzt regelmäßig Themen, die der Präsident kurz darauf aufgreift; der wiederum fabriziert regelmäßig Nachrichten (darunter eine kaum überschaubare Menge an Unwahrheiten), die Fox News schnell verbreitet. Beide brauchen einander. Beide brauchen auch die ständige Feindesbeschwörung, um die eigenen Wähler beziehungsweise Zuschauer bei Laune zu halten.\nAuf den ersten Blick wirkt es so, als hätte sich diese symbiotische Beziehung auch in den vergangenen Wochen der heraufziehenden und sich nun in den USA scheinbar ungebremst entwickelnden Corona-Krise wie gewohnt fortgesetzt. Trump leugnete zunächst – synchron zu den On-air-Aussagen der meisten Fox-News-Moderatoren – die Gefahren des Coronavirus und bezichtigte den politischen Gegner, die Demokratische Partei, neuerlich, eine Verschwörung gegen ihn und das Land zu betreiben. Nach den Mueller-Ermittlungen, nach dem Impeachment-Verfahren sollte nun Corona der nächste angebliche \"hoax\" sein, die nächste erfundene Geschichte, um den Präsidenten und dessen vermeintliche Leistungen herabzusetzen.\nIm Laufe des Monats März indes veränderte sich Trumps Rhetorik, erneut im Einklang mit der seines Haussenders. Der Ton wurde vorübergehend vorsichtiger, manchmal gar im herkömmlichen Sinne präsidentiell. Bis Donald Trump vor einigen Tagen die Geduld verlor, offenbar dauert ihm mit diesem Virus alles zu lange: Nach Ostern, also Mitte April, müsse das Land wieder \"geöffnet\" werden, forderte Trump (und bekam dafür von Fox News die Bühne geboten). Der Präsident will offenbar die auch in weiten Teilen der USA mittlerweile geltenden Ausgangsbeschränkungen am liebsten wieder aufgehoben sehen. Der Wirtschaftsmotor soll angeworfen werden, per Kaltstart von null auf hundert. Trump, der den Stand der US-Aktienindizes zum Gradmesser seines politischen Wirkens erklärt hat, kann keine Rezession gebrauchen. Nicht wenige Monate vor der Präsidentschaftswahl.\nTrump geht es, das haben die vergangenen Wochen eindrucksvoll bestätigt, primär um eine Sache: seine Wiederwahl im November. Kurz sah es so aus, als entgleite ihm zumindest die Deutungshoheit über diese Krise – dass seine Administration wichtige Wochen, ja fast zwei Monate verstreichen ließ, ohne eine bundesstaatliche Präventionsstrategie gegen die Ausbreitung des Coronavirus zu entwickeln, ist offensichtlich. Nun geht es darum, wenigstens den Spin über die Krise zu behalten, die Erzählung zu bestimmen. Seit Trump sich in den täglichen Corona-Pressekonferenzen im Weißen Haus als starker Leader positioniert, steigt seine Beliebtheit wieder. Trumps Zustimmungswerte liegen je nach Umfrage bei bis zu 49 Prozent, das sind erstaunlich hohe Werte angesichts des offenkundig schlechten Krisenmanagements seiner Administration.\nBetrachtet man die vergangenen drei Monate seit der Kunde vom Corona-Ausbruch in der chinesischen Provinz Wuhan, war eine Sache im politisch-medialen Amerika diesmal anders als sonst. Es gab einen hochkarätigen Fox-News-Moderator, der sich viel früher als die anderen auf das Thema Corona gestürzt hat. Im Januar bereits, als seine Kollegen, der Präsident und auch die meisten Konkurrenzsender noch hauptsächlich mit dem Impeachment-Verfahren beschäftigt waren, schlug Tucker Carlson in Sachen Corona Alarm. Carlson sendet jeden Abend zur Prime Time um 20 Uhr und zählt zu den einflussreichsten Stimmungsmachern des Landes.\nNoch bemerkenswerter war, dass Carlson schon einen Schuldigen gefunden hatte, bevor die massenhafte Verbreitung von Covid-19-Infektionen in den USA überhaupt begonnen hatte. Carlson machte die \"chinesische Kultur\" verantwortlich, als Trump via Twitter dem chinesischen Präsidenten Xi Jinping noch für dessen Umgang mit dem Virus dankte. In gewisser Weise war Carlson \"trumpesker als Trump\", wie es die Vanity Fair vor ein paar Tagen formulierte: Carlson sah in dem Virus eine Chance, allerdings eine rassistische. Er legte damit den Grundstein für das, was man seither immer stärker in den USA sieht: die rechte Instrumentalisierung der Pandemie.\nDass Trump, der noch Ende Februar davon gesprochen hat, die Zahl der Infizierten in den USA werde bald bei \"nahe null\" liegen, sein Land mittlerweile in einem \"Krieg\" gegen das \"chinesische Virus\" sieht und sich selbst als \"Präsident in Kriegszeiten\", liegt offenbar auch daran, dass sich Tucker Carlson Anfang März zu einer außergewöhnlichen Intervention entschlossen hat. Nachdem der Moderator wochenlang Trumps offenkundiges Verleugnen der heraufziehenden Corona-Krise beobachtet hatte, reiste er am 7. März nach Florida, um Trump dort, in dessen Privatclub Mar-a-Lago, höchstselbst vom Ernst der Lage zu überzeugen. Er habe eine \"moralische Verpflichtung verspürt\", sagte Carlson später in einem Interview. Zwei Stunden lang soll das Gespräch zwischen den beiden Männern gedauert haben. Offenbar mit Wirkung. Vieles von dem, was Trump seither macht, folgt Carlsons Skript.\nDas lautet: eine einfache Erzählung für eine komplexe Situation finden. Mehr als drei Millionen US-Amerikaner haben aufgrund des faktischen Einfrierens der US-Wirtschaft in den vergangenen zwei Wochen bereits ihre Arbeit verloren, das Land bewegt sich auf eine Rezession zu, die Krankenhäuser in besonders betroffenen Großstädten wie New York City und Seattle sind längst überlastet. Trump versucht nun Antworten ebenso wie Ablenkungen zu finden. Die Richtung zeichnet sich zunehmend ab: noch härter die Landesgrenzen schützen; noch vehementer die vermeintlichen Feinde des Landes betonen; noch stärker den amerikanischen Patriotismus und exceptionalism beschwören; noch furioser die heimische Wirtschaft loben – und gleichzeitig vor ihrem Untergang warnen.\nKurz: Trump wird wohl noch mehr Trump. Und die rechten Medien werden ihm dabei helfen, insbesondere Fox News.\nDie Figur Tucker Carlson ist nicht nur interessant, um Trumps Taktikwechsel zu verstehen. Carlsons tägliches Programm zeigt auch, wie Panikproduktion funktioniert. In den Monologen, die der 50-Jährige zu Beginn jeder Sendung hält, verdammt er verlässlich alles, was irgendwie links ist: prinzipielle Zustimmung zu Einwanderung, Feminismus, Klimaschutz, politische Korrektheit, Globalismus, Diversität. Was Carlson von den anderen Fox-News-Anchors unterscheidet, ist sein gelegentliches Anreden auch gegen Republikaner. Carlson inszeniert sich gerne als empörter Lautsprecher des einfachen Arbeiters. Doch die vermeintliche Opposition zum Establishment erfüllt – genau wie bei Trump – letztlich nur den Zweck, den chauvinistischen Teil des weißen Amerikas gegen Minderheiten und Einwanderer auszuspielen.\nBereits in der ersten Sendung, in der Carlson über den Corona-Virus berichtete, am 23. Januar, ließ er erkennen, welche Message bei seinen Zuschauern fortan ankommen sollte. \"Ich weiß, dass wir so tun müssen, als wären alle Kulturen und alle Verhaltensweisen gleich\", sagte Carlson, doch das sei nicht der Fall. \"Die Misshandlung von Tieren, das Essen von Koalas und Schlangen und Fledermäusen und Hunden, das ist in dieser Stadt, Wuhan, offenbar üblich\", fuhr er fort.\nWas Tucker Carlson in den folgenden zwei Monaten seinen Millionen Zuschauern täglich einhämmerte, lässt sich ungefähr zu dieser Erzählung verdichten, die er in seiner Sendung am 6. März zusammenfasste, einen Tag vor seiner Reise nach Florida: Das kommunistische China habe erst die Kontrolle über das globale Pharmageschäft übernommen, dann ein Virus auf die Welt losgelassen, und weil liberalen Medien und linken Aktivisten in den USA Antirassismus und Identitätspolitik wichtiger sei als sichere Grenzen, müssten nun etliche Menschen sterben. Nicht etwa der Klimawandel sei die existenziellste Bedrohung der USA, sondern die angebliche Abhängigkeit von China. \"Die Leute, die uns sagten, dass das Leben in einer grenzenlosen Welt keine Nachteile bringe, haben gelogen\", so der Moderator. \"Trump hatte recht mit allem: Handel, Einwanderung, Produktion, Globalisierung.\" Carlsons Botschaft war unmissverständlich: Die Corona-Krise sei eine Chance, Trumps Slogan \"Make America great again\" endgültig umzusetzen.\nDie Botschaft scheint angekommen zu sein. \"Ich glaube, dass wir viel gelernt haben. Wir haben eine Menge gelernt. Diese Krise hat deutlich gemacht, wie wichtig es ist, starke Grenzen und einen robusten Produktionssektor zu haben\", sagte Trump neulich bei einer Pressekonferenz. Ein paar Tage zuvor hatte sein Stab eine E-Mail an Trump-Unterstützer geschickt, in der es hieß, die USA würden \"nicht nur von einem unsichtbaren Virus, sondern auch von den Chinesen attackiert\". Dass die Zahl der Attacken auf US-Amerikaner mit asiatischer Herkunftsgeschichte in den letzten Wochen stark zugenommen hat, dürfte eine direkte Folge dieser Propaganda sein. \"Ich habe mich in meinen 27 Jahren in diesem Land noch nie so gefühlt\", schrieb Jiayang Fan, eine Autorin des New Yorker, Mitte März bei Twitter.\nEines kann man Trump nach über drei Jahren im Weißen Haus nicht mehr vorwerfen: dass er schwer zu lesen ist. Mal folgt er seinen Impulsen, mal folgt er Fox News. Er kennt keine Scham, inhaltliche Widersprüche sind ihm egal. In erster Linie geht es aber immer darum, seine Macht zu behaupten. In der Hinsicht ist er bemerkenswert transparent.\nWas das Corona-Narrativ betrifft, scheinen sich der Präsident und die rechten Medienmacher ganz offensichtlich geeinigt zu haben. Das Narrativ heißt Krieg.\nDass das nicht nur rhetorisch gemeint ist, wird immer deutlicher. Am 26. März meldete das Magazin The Nation, dass die Regierung in Washington zusätzliche 1.500 Soldaten an die mexikanische und kanadische Grenze schicken werde. Während Städte wie New York seit Wochen auf Unterstützung aus Washington warten, rüstet die Regierung die bereits übermilitarisierte Grenze auf.\n\"Ich bin ein Präsident im Krieg\", sagte Trump vor wenigen Tagen bei einer Pressekonferenz. Und legte nach: \"Dies ist ein Krieg. Eine andere Art von Krieg, als wir ihn je hatten.\"\n"}, {"content": "Chinese doctor who first found out about coronavirus was censored.

A Sars outbreak in 2003 in Southern China had left more than 8,000 people infected and 774 dead over 17 nations.\nLi's message was meant to be a cautionary note for his medical school friends to take care of their loved ones. But within hours of Wenliang revealing the information, the chats spread like wildfire on Chinese social media.\nHis name was exposed to hundreds of citizens. \"When I saw them circulating online, I realised that it was out of my control and I would probably be punished,\" Li was quoted as saying by CNN recently.\nAnd that is exactly what happened.\nAUTHORITIES SILENCE NEWS OF OUTBREAK\nOn January 3, Chinese authorities summoned Li and seven other doctors and accused them of spreading rumours. A stern message calling for an end to rumour-mongering was broadcast across China.\n\"The police call on all netizens to not fabricate rumours, not spread rumours, not believe rumours,\" the message read.\nLi was made to sign an affidavit acknowledging his crime and had to promise he will not engage in any such activities in the future.\nBut Li's troubles did not end there.\nThe ophthalmologist returned to work soon. While treating a patient affected with coronavirus, the infection was also transmitted to Li. Over the coming days, he showed the same symptoms -- coughing, shortness of breath and fever.\nBy January 12, he was admitted to a hospital. His condition continued to deteriorate and he had to be shifted to the ICU.\nIt was not till January 20 that China would take stock of the spread of coronavirus and declare a national emergency. On the same day, Chinese President Xi Jinping said, \"People's lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed.\"\nLi's diagnosis of coronavirus was only confirmed on February 1. He died five days later.\nTOO MUCH CENSORSHIP LED TO VIRUS OUTBREAK\nA too-harsh crackdown on online rumours during China’s deadly viral epidemic had undermined public trust, China's top court said in a highly rare rebuke of the police force.\nSupreme Court Judge Tang Xinghua wrote Wednesday that officers should have been more lenient with those informing of the outbreak.\nIf the public had believed these rumours’ at the time, and carried out measures like wearing masks, strictly disinfecting and avoiding wildlife markets it might have been a good thing, he said.\nWuhan police responded in a post on the social media platform Weibo that they had only given education and criticism to the eight and had not meted out harsher punishment such as warnings, fines, or detention.\nBut some users were unhappy with the reply, with one demanding the police apologize and asking: Is it so hard to acknowledge you have done wrong?\nAuthorities in Wuhan have already been criticized online for withholding information about the infection until the end of last year, despite knowing about the new illness weeks earlier.\nOverall 564 people have died in China due to the virus and 28,018 confirmed cases have been reported from 31 provincial-level regions, the National Health Commission reported on Thursday.\n"}, {"content": "Washington state man becomes first US coronavirus fatality.

O quadro que Pequim está a mostrar de infecções por coronavírus não está a reflectir a realidade, diz o diário britânico Financial Times com base em várias entrevistas com médicos, enfermeiros e pessoal hospitalar em Wuhan e Pequim. Há suspeitas de que nem todos os novos casos estejam a ser registados, e há uma categoria que está a ser sistematicamente deixada de fora da lista dos casos oficiais: os infectados que não têm sintomas.\nNa província de Hubei, onde está a cidade de Wuhan onde teve origem a pandemia, não foi reportado mais do que um novo caso por dia durante mais de uma semana, o que permitiu ao Governo dizer que o período de crise acabou, e decretar uma espécie de regresso à normalidade: muitas pessoas já estão a recomeçar a trabalhar, embora sob enormes medidas de segurança, distanciamento obrigatório nos postos de trabalho e refeitórios, desinfecções três vezes por dia dos postos de trabalho, por exemplo.\nE mesmo pequenos passos foram já revertidos: se foi muito falada a reabertura dos cinemas (embora de um número de salas que representava apenas 5% do enorme mercado chinês, em províncias pouco centrais, e com filmes antigos), esta sexta-feira, passados dez dias, foi anunciado que os cinemas fechavam todos de novo, sem que fosse dada nenhuma razão. Poucos espectadores aproveitaram a reabertura: muitos temem que a situação não esteja ainda controlada e não querem expor-se a risco.\nPequim anunciou entretanto a suspensão de entrada de estrangeiros, dizendo que os casos novos de. covid-19 são importados. Esta sexta-feira os EUA e a Itália ultrapassaram a China em número de infectados, segundo dados da Universidade Johns Hopkins.\nO Financial Times entrevistou vários médicos e especialistas que estão na China - a maioria falou sob anonimato - e que dizem que a situação em Wuhan pode ser pior do que as autoridades estão a mostrar.Duas enfermeiras na cidade falaram ao diário britânico, dizendo que há números “escondidos”, que apesar de cumprirem os critérios para casos confirmados, não estão a ser incluídos nas contas.\n“O pessoal de saúde diz que o hospital está a fazer tudo para controlar a contagem de novos casos”, disse uma das enfermeiras. “É extremamente preocupante continuar a publicitar que não há novos casos. É muito arriscado, e pode significar que os sacrifícios feitos em Wuhan e em toda a província de Hubei não valeram de nada”, queixou-se.\nAlém disto, as autoridades estão a contar os casos de pessoas infectadas que não têm sintomas, mas não a incluí-los nos casos confirmados, disse um perito de saúde que vive em Pequim. A agência governamental que faz as linhas de orientação sobre o que deve ser considerado um caso confirmado, diz o Financial Times, diz que os casos assintomáticos não devem constar no total de casos confirmados.\nEsta distinção pode ser problemática porque mesmo que não se saiba como ou em que percentagem, as pessoas sem sintomas continuam a poder transmitir o vírus a outras. E o jornal local Caixin citava peritos dizendo que em Wuhan eram detectados, todos dias, “alguns, ou algumas dezenas, de portadores assintomáticos”, o que que dizer que não é possível ainda “concluir que a transmissão parou em Wuhan”.\nO Governo mantém que estes casos não são um problema, porque lhes é ordenada quarentena durante a qual se observa se ficam com sintomas, e caso isso aconteça, são reclassificados como casos confirmados. \nFalando no geral, não no caso chinês, o director-geral da Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, disse na quarta-feira que as medidas de isolamento “são a melhor maneira de parar a transmissão para que quando forem levantadas, não haja um ressurgimento do coronavírus”.

El coronavirus de Wuhan es un ejemplo de manual de acontecimiento inesperado que afecta a la salud y la economía. El consumo de proteínas en los países emergentes se ha disparado a medida que su economía y nivel de vida han crecido. La interacción entre virus animales y enfermedades humanas también. Un riesgo conocido, pero desgraciadamente cada vez más frecuente. Puede que se frene, pero también hay un riesgo de que se convierta en una pandemia mundial. La experiencia anterior más similar fue la del virus Sars en 2002-2003. Desde entonces han mejorado los mecanismos de prevención y la reacción ante alertas sanitarias en todo Asia. En países como Corea del Sur, he podido apreciar personalmente hace unos días que, a pesar de que la incidencia es casi nula, los mensajes públicos en redes y medidas sanitarias son considerables.\nLo que ahora se maneja es una importante incertidumbre que ya tiene un impacto económico negativo significativo. Hasta la fecha, las consecuencias de este tipo de eventos no se han extendido más allá de unos meses. No es un gran alivio, en todo caso, porque si el coronavirus se convierte en una pandemia, los efectos pueden ser graves en un momento de cierto decaimiento. La resistencia de una economía global débil en 2020 pasa por la evolución de la economía china y el coronavirus no ayuda. Los primeros reflejos ya se aprecian. Han llegado por el precio del crudo. La caída de la demanda -entre otras cuestiones por menor actividad industrial y tráfico terrestre y aéreo en China- redujo el precio del barril Brent en un 6% sólo en la semana pasada.\nLos índices de valor y volatilidad bursátiles aún no han reaccionado a estos temores de forma apreciable. Pero en los foros de análisis de mercado el riesgo de contagio está en todas las bocas. Si éste y otros peligros geopolíticos -como las tensiones con Irán- no se reflejan más en los mercados es porque estos están más pendientes de los bancos centrales. La laxitud de la política monetaria parece haber mermado la capacidad de emitir señales de alerta.\nSi se llega a una pandemia, la experiencia dicta que podrían verse afectados los valores de las empresas emergentes, con caídas de hasta el 20%. El SARS se llevó la vida de 800 personas y tuvo un coste estimado de 50.000 millones de dólares. Ya hay más de 40 millones de ciudadanos chinos aislados pero algunos analistas temen que este círculo de protección haya llegado tarde. Se ha reavivado del debate en la comunidad médica sobre si el uso masivo de antibióticos en granjas animales está teniendo un efecto negativo en los niveles de inmunidad de los humanos. A favor de evitar la extensión pandémica juega la mejora en los mecanismos de prevención.

Older malaria drugs are being studied, and in some cases used, to treat or try to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, even though there is no firm evidence to show they are effective. Studies are underway in a number of countries, including China, France and the United States, to see whether the pills - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - may have a role to play in the rapidly spreading pandemic.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has touted the malaria drugs as \"a game changer.\" But the Food and Drug Administration and other health experts said trials must first ensure the medicines are effective and safe for use in this patient population.  \n  \n WHY ARE MALARIA DRUGS UNDER CONSIDERATION?  \n There are currently no vaccines or U.S.-approved treatments for the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that has killed more than 18,000 worldwide, so even the most severely ill patients largely receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.  \n On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotal use of hydroxychloroquine at different doses.  \n Chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found on the bark of the cinchona plant. It has been used for hundreds of years in South America to treat fever.  \n Chloroquine was first synthesized in the 1930s. A version called hydroxychloroquine, in use since the 1950s, is considered to be less toxic, according to studies. Both drugs can cause serious side effects, including vision loss, heart problems or even death, if used incorrectly.  \n The drugs are used to combat malaria, which is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites, because they interrupt its ability to digest a host's blood cells.  \n Scientists have detailed biochemical proprieties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections. These include direct antiviral effects, such as blocking steps needed by certain viruses to replicate, and its ability to suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.  \n In addition to malaria, hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  \n  \n WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY?  \n Data has begun to emerge from some coronavirus trials, but most information so far is preliminary.  \n A French team last week said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo. But the trial is small and results on patient outcomes are still awaited.  \n Chinese researchers last month reported trial results showing that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group. It has been added as a recommended treatment for the illness in China, where the virus first emerged in December.  \n This week, the Journal of Zhejiang University reported disappointing results from a 30-patient Shanghai study of hydroxychloroquine. It showed the drug worked no better than standard care for patients with COVID-19.  \n The University of Minnesota has launched a 1,500-person trial to see whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 in people exposed to the virus - including healthcare workers and family members of infected people.  \n Other trials of the malaria drugs are ongoing or set to start in the United Kingdom, Norway and Thailand.  \n New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak with more than 25,000 cases, on Sunday said it had acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of the malaria drugs to use in a clinical trial.  \n  \n IS THERE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND?  \n In the United States, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have already spiked and are in short supply, according to pharmacists.  \n Several makers of the generic medicines said they are increasing production of chloroquine pills. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, Mylan NV and Bayer AG have donated large quantities of the drugs to health authorities.  \n  \n PRESCRIPTION ONLY!  \n Health officials caution that no one should be taking these drugs to treat or prevent coronavirus infection without medical supervision and a prescription.  \n In Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after taking a nonmedical form of chloroquine used to fight parasites in aquariums.  \n \"Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,” said Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the poison and drug information centre at Arizona-based Banner Health.

Cobra chinesa, Naja atra\nMartin Harvey/Getty Images\nUm estudo publicado no Journal of Medical Virology aponta para duas espécies de cobras chinesas - a Bungarus multicinctus e Naja atra (conhecida por cobra chinesa) -, vendidas no mercado de Wuhan, como o mais provável agente transmissor do coronavírus - conhecido como 2019-nCoV - de animais para humanos.\nA conclusão, ainda não fechada e controversa, foi avançada por investigadores das universidades de Pequim e Bioengenharia de Wuhan, a cidade onde surgiram os primeiros pacientes infetados, alguns dos quais trabalhadores no local de venda de carne de animais exóticos, como morcegos, sapos, ouriços, cobras e serpentes.\nO surto que já levou as autoridades chinesas a alargar a quarentena a 20 cidades e 33 milhões de pessoas é apontado como tendo origem num vírus da mesma família da epidemia SARS (Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave) e MERS (Síndrome Respiratória do Médio Oriente), detetado inicialmente em morcegos e que terá sofrido uma mutação em cobras e serpentes.\nA conclusão do estudo, ainda sem validação científica, foi avançada após terem sido efetuadas análises de sequência genéticas a mais de 200 genomas de coronarovírus em possíveis animais hospedeiros, posteriormente comparados com as amostras das pessoas infetadas.\nAs análises comprovaram que a sequência genética do vírus 2019-nCoV terá tido como agente transmissor original o morcego, antes de 'saltar' para cobras e destas para os seres humanos. Para os investigadores ainda é um mistério como o coronavírus se transmitiu de hospedeiros de sangue frio para os humanos, vírus que causa complicações respiratórias e pneumonias graves que podem levar à morte.\nSegundo o Centro de Controlo e Prevenção de Doenças (CDS), são raros os casos de coronavírus suscetíveis de serem transmitidos de animais para humanos, como agora acontece com o 2019-n-CoV. No estudo publicado esta quinta-feira, os investigadores descobriram que esta estirpe de vírus é uma mistura ou combinação de dois coronavírus - um que infeta morcegos, outro de origem desconhecida até agora, mas que depois dos genes de vários espécies de animais analisadas tudo aponta para as cobras como o agente modificador.\nInvestigadores não envolvidos no estudo em curso questionam, contudo, as conclusões dos docentes das universidades chinesas, garantindo Paulo Eduardo Paixão, virologista da Universidade de São Paulo, no Brasil, que “não existem evidências” científicas de que a cobra possa ser hospedeiro do vírus em causa.\nA Organização Mundial da Saúde decidiu esta quinta-feira não avançar para já com a declaração de situação de emergência de saúde pública internacional.\n"}, {"content": "Malaysia confirms 16th case of coronavirus.

Esta terça-feira, as autoridades judiciais italianas abriram uma investigação à rápida escalada dos preços de venda online de produtos como máscaras clínicas e frascos de gel desinfectante, com vice-procuradora-geral de Milão, Tiziana Siciliano, a denunciar “preços absurdos”.\"O preço online das máscaras subiu de um cêntimo para dez euros cada e o de um frasco de um litro de gel desinfectante que há uma semana custava sete euros subiu ontem para 39 euros”, exemplificou, citada pela Reuters.\nItália soma já o equivalente a cerca de um terço das mortes fora da China, com mais de 300 casos confirmados, mas continua à procura do seu “paciente zero” e aperta as medidas de contenção. As tomadas de posição mais mediáticas foram a interrupção do Carnaval de Veneza, que chegou ao fim no domingo e devia terminar apenas esta terça-feira.\nNo entanto, as medidas com mais impacto para os cidadãos italianos foram as de contenção anunciadas este fim-de-semana para dez localidades, e onde vivem ao todo cerca de 50 mil pessoas: Véneto, Piamonte e Lombardia são as regiões críticas.\nPor enquanto, o padrão de mortes registado em Itália é semelhante ao verificado na China. São as pessoas mais idosas e com doenças associadas, como cancro, diabetes, doenças respiratórias e outras que deprimam o sistema imunitário, que estão a ser mais afectadas.\nEntretanto, ali bem perto, Áustria, Croácia e Suíça confirmaram casos de infecção.

Após três reuniões, a Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) decidiu que o surto de coronavírus  deve ser classificado como uma emergência de saúde pública de interesse internacional.  O que é que isso pode mudar em relação às várias medidas de contenção aplicadas por todo o mundo? Pouco ou quase nada. Obviamente, as autoridades de saúde não ficaram à espera da decisão da OMS para avançar com todas as medidas de controlo, sob o princípio da precaução.\nO facto de o novo coronavírus ter já entrado em 18 países após a identificação do surto em Dezembro na cidade de Wuhan, na China, e a confirmação de transmissão da doença entre humanos fora do território chinês terão sido dois factores que levaram a OMS a convocar os peritos mais uma vez. O comité de emergência reuniu-se pela terceira vez no período de uma semana para discutir a necessidade de declarar uma emergência global de saúde pública. Actualmente, existem 98 casos em 18 países fora da China, incluindo 8 casos de transmissão de pessoa para pessoa em quatro países: Alemanha, Japão, Vietname e EUA.\nQuando a reunião ainda estava a decorrer o “boletim” diário da OMS sobre o coronavírus nesta quinta-feira actualizava os números subindo de 15 para 18 países afectados em relação ao dia anterior. Sublinhava-se ainda que os novos casos detectados na Finlândia, Filipinas e Índia têm alguma ligação a viagens à cidade de Wuhan. No boletim, a OMS referia 7818 casos confirmados e 170 mortes. No entanto, os números actualizados ao início da noite apontavam para 8235 doentes infectados, com 171 mortos, segundo uma equipa da Universidade Johns Hopkins (nos EUA) que acompanha a situação. “Temos de recordar que não são apenas números, são pessoas”, disse o director-geral da OMS.\nInvocar uma Emergência de Saúde Pública de Âmbito Internacional (PHEIC, na sigla em inglês) é, basicamente, o sinal mais importante que a OMS pode dar ao mundo. As regras deste processo dizem que para declarar uma PHEIC a situação em análise tem de cumprir três critérios: deve ser um acontecimento extraordinário, com um risco que represente um perigo elevado à saúde pública de outros países e que exija uma resposta internacional coordenada. É a sexta vez que a OMS recorre a este instrumento de alerta global.\n“Sejamos claros, esta declaração não é um voto de falta de confiança na China”, sublinhou Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-geral da OMS aos jornalistas. “A nossa maior preocupação é o potencial do vírus se espalhar para países com sistemas de saúde mais frágeis”, acrescentou. O painel da OMS, presidido por Didier Houssin, da França, é composto por 16 especialistas independentes. “O principal motivo desta declaração não é o que está a acontecer na China, mas o que está acontecer noutros países”, sublinhou.\nCom esta nova designação para classificar a epidemia do novo coronavírus que foi detectado em Dezembro na China, a OMS pode fazer recomendações a todos os países para controlar o surto. Algo que já começou a fazer há bastante tempo. Pode também emitir recomendações sobre viagens e vigilância de passageiros em aeroportos internacionais e outros portos de chegada. Algo que também não será necessário fazer porque muitos países já avançaram para medidas de contenção desse tipo. \n“A OMS não recomenda a restrição de viagens, as trocas comerciais e os movimentos [de pessoas] e opõe-se mesmo a todas as restrições de viagens”, afirmou o director-geral da OMS na conferência de imprensa que decorreu esta quinta-feira ao final do dia, na sede da organização, em Genebra, Suíça.\nA decisão da OMS poderá ainda levar a um aumento do financiamento e recursos para conter o surto. Essa é, à primeira vista, a principal diferença que podemos constatar em relação aos últimos dias. Mas não é fácil imaginar como é que os países podem reforçar ainda mais o esforço que têm demonstrado na vigilância, detecção e acompanhamento de novos casos. Este novo coronavírus manifesta-se com uma gravidade variável, desde sintomas ligeiros semelhantes a uma gripe ou constipação até sintomas mais graves como a pneumonia (entre os 7818 infectados há 1370 num situação considerada grave). O período de incubação varia entre dois e 12 dias \nO dinheiro poderá servir para impor mais medidas no terreno, mas também para investir na “máquina” científica que está a trabalhar neste campo desde muito cedo. O primeiro genoma do vírus foi partilhado pela equipa da China com a comunidade internacional no início deste mês. Esta quinta-feira, mais uma vez, o director-geral da OMS elogiou a China pela colaboração em todo o processo. “Já teríamos visto muitos outros casos fora da China - e provavelmente mortes - se não fossem os esforços do governo e o progresso que eles fizeram para proteger a população da China e de todo o mundo.”\n“A única maneira de derrotar este surto é com todos os países a trabalhar juntos em um espírito de solidariedade e cooperação”, concluiu Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus deixando ainda o aviso em tom de apelo: “Este é o momento dos factos, não do medo. Este é o momento da ciência, não de rumores. Este é o momento da solidariedade, não do estigma.”\nSerá com a cooperação entre todos os países que será possível reduzir o número de pessoas infectadas. E essa é a chave para travar a epidemia, diz ao PÚBLICO Nuno Faria, professor associado em epidemiologia genómica da Universidade de Oxford, Reino Unido. Assim, prossegue, “há duas maneiras de conseguir reduzir o número de pessoas infectadas”. “Uma é através de vacinas e tratamento, que infelizmente ainda não estão disponíveis para o novo vírus. Embora já existam equipas na China continental, Estados Unidos e Hong Kong, a trabalhar numa vacina vai demorar algum tempo até termos uma vacina eficaz. A outra envolve controlo da epidemia através de uma serie de intervenções que visam reduzir o contacto entre pessoas infectadas e pessoas ainda susceptíveis ao novo vírus.”\nA Aliança para Inovações de Prontidão para Epidemias (CEPI, na sigla em inglês) anunciou pouco tempo depois que três diferentes equipas de investigação estão a tentar desenvolver vacinas contra o novo coronavírus. O objectivo é que comecem em Junho os ensaios clínicos para, pelo menos, uma das vacinas.\nAs equipas de investigação terão diferentes abordagens: uma será liderada pela empresa farmacêutica Moderna em conjunto com o Instituto Nacional para Alergia e Doenças Infecciosas dos EUA; outra pela empresa Inovio; e a terceira por uma equipa da Universidade de Queensland, na Austrália. “Não há garantias de sucesso, mas esperamos que este trabalho seja um passo significativo e importante no desenvolvimento de uma vacina para esta doença”, afirmou Richard Hatchett, director-executivo da CEPI.\nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\nA verdade é que os casos de infecção esta semana aumentaram substancialmente. Será que é um reflexo do aumento da vigilância. “Em apenas uma semana pelo menos sete universidades e instituições de saúde pública desenharam e partilharam com a comunidade novos métodos de diagnóstico para o novo vírus. Com o aumento de casos a serem testados, espera-se um aumento do número de casos confirmados também”, constata Nuno Faria.\nO impacto deste novo vírus vai depender de vários factores que ainda não estão completos ou completamente claros, incluindo a taxa de mortalidade e a sua transmissibilidade, ou seja, a facilidade com que se propaga na população. As actuais estimativas situam a taxa de mortalidade do 2019-nCoV abaFFixo dos 3%. “Para contextualizar, os outros coronavírus que causaram surtos recentes como o SARS [em 2003] e o MERS [em 2012] têm uma taxa de mortalidade bastante superior na ordem dos 10% e 37%, respectivamente. Contudo, uma das preocupações em relação ao novo coronavírus 2019-nCoV é maior facilidade com que se transmite entre humanos em comparação aos seus ‘primos' SARS e MERS”, sublinha o epidemiologista português que colabora com a OMS.\nA última vez que a OMS declarou uma emergência global de saúde pública foi em 2019 para o surto do vírus do ébola, que ainda está em curso na República Democrática do Congo e já matou mais de 2000 pessoas. A OMS também considerou como emergências de saúde pública de nível internacional as seguintes epidemias: em 2016, o vírus Zika; em 2014, o anterior surto de ébola na África Ocidental e que matou mais de 11.000 pessoas entre 2014 e 2016; em 2014, a poliomielite; em 2009, a gripe suína (o vírus H1N1).\n"}, {"content": "Exclusive: Citadel turns 2020 profit after spotting virus risk early. BOSTON (Reuters) - Citadel, the Chicago-based hedge fund giant led by billionaire Ken Griffin, has so far weathered the coronavirus market storm well, turning a slight profit in its flagship Wellington hedge fund for the year through Monday, according to a person familiar with the situation.\nThe fund, which practices a so-called multi-strategy array of bets on stocks, bonds, commodities and other securities using teams of traders, was as of Friday down 5.25% for March, the person said, who requested anonymity because the information is private. The exact year-to-date gain, which is net of fees, was not finalized.\nBy comparison, Goldman Sachs’ prime services division estimated that the average equity-focused hedge fund is down 15.5% for the month through Thursday, with average year-to-date losses at nearly 16%.\nCitadel’s multi-strategy competitors are still down for the year amid the coronavirus-led market rout. Millennium Management LLC’s main hedge fund is down about 4.3% for 2020 through March 20, while Schonfeld Strategic Advisors LLC is down about 15% through March 16, according to people briefed on the returns.\nThe exact drivers of Citadel’s relative outperformance were unclear. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Citadel’s fixed-income portfolio recently lost hundreds of millions of dollars, in part from so-called basis trades on pricing gaps between U.S. Treasuries and futures, although those unrealized losses were recovered within days. The Citadel Global Fixed Income Fund is now positive for the year through Monday, the person with knowledge of Citadel said.\nCitadel showed it was thinking about coronavirus and its market impact relatively early.\nOn Feb. 6, Griffin called the coronavirus “probably the most concrete short-run risk we see in the financial markets globally” during an appearance at The Economic Club of New York.\n“It’s not a Chinese health crisis. It is a global health crisis,” he said.\nCitadel had three days earlier announced that its executives had mobilized $7.5 million to support relief efforts in the United States and China, including more than $1 million in medical supplies to a hospital in hard-hit Wuhan.\nThe firm recently set up the Citadel Relative Value Fixed Income Fund, according to a March 13 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a bid to take advantage of new market volatility.\nCitadel has placed an emphasis on risk management since the last financial crisis, when its main funds lost 55% over 2008 and were forced to temporarily limit client withdrawals.\nIts website touts “a quarter of a century establishing risk management as a core discipline” and a global risk management center in Chicago, anchored by a 27 foot by 8 foot data visualization touchscreen.\nThe firm still uses significant leverage, or borrowed money, to amplify its potential profits. A Jan. 17 SEC filing notes regulatory assets under management of about $194 billion as of Dec. 31, 2018, implying leverage of approximately six and a half times Citadel’s $30 billion in invested assets as of February, according to its website.\n2020 marks 30 years since Citadel was founded by Griffin, who famously started the firm after trading from his Harvard College dorm room. The annualized return for Citadel’s Wellington fund, launched in 1990, was 18.78% net of fees through 2019, the person said, more than double the S&P 500 Index.\n"}, {"content": "Autarca de Wuhan admite ter escondido informação sobre coronavírus e põe cargo à disposição. Zhou Xianwang, presidente da Câmara Municipal de Wuhan, a cidade chinesa onde o novo coronavírus (2019-nCoV) foi inicialmente detetado, admitiu ter escondido informações sobre o surto. O tempo que o governo local demorou a transmitir os dados que já tinha foi suficiente para que da cidade saíssem pelo menos cinco milhões de pessoas, antes de ter sido decretado o isolamento, facto que pode ter contribuído para que o vírus se espalhasse pelo país. Xianwang confessou também que a transmissão estava a ser feita entre pessoas e não através de bactérias ou outros meios.\nCom a revelação feita esta segunda-feira à televisão estatal chinesa, o autarca concluiu que a única saída era pôr o cargo à disposição. O mesmo fez o secretário do Partido Comunista da China em Wuhan, Ma Guoqiang. “Os nossos nomes viverão na infâmia, mas enquanto for benéfico ao controlo da doença e à vida e segurança das pessoas, o camarada Ma Guoqiang e eu assumiremos qualquer responsabilidade”, disse ainda.\nO número de casos de infeção em Wuahn aumentou 50% só no último fim de semana, o que levou as autoridades a anunciar a construção de um segundo hospital de emergência, com espaço para 1300 doentes — o primeiro abre no dia 3 de fevereiro e terá mil camas. Nesta altura, as contas apontam para 81 mortos e 2744 feridos na sequência da infeção com o coronavírus.\nAlém do caso de possível demissão, as autoridades chinesas têm sido alvo de críticas pelos cidadãos chineses nas redes sociais, sobretudo por causa da forma como tem sido gerido o surto do coronavírus. Muitos internautas chineses ficaram indignados com o que denunciam ser uma série de erros que ocorreram durante a conferência de imprensa acima referida, em que participaram três autoridades locais.\nO governador da província de Hubei (onde está localizada a cidade de Wuhan), Wang Xiaodong, esteve na conferência sem usar máscara, violando as regras que tornam o seu uso obrigatório em espaços públicos. Já o autarca Zhou Xianwang, a seu lado, lembrou-se da máscara, mas usou-a ao contrário, o que provocou piadas na rede social Weibo, o equivalente chinês do Twitter.\nO presidente da Câmara de Wuhan já havia sido fortemente criticado por ter autorizado, a 18 e 19 de janeiro, um banquete gigante para o qual foram convidadas 40 mil famílias, para celebrar o Ano Novo chinês. Os comentários de crítica são as exceções no meio da censura que o Governo chinês continua a promover na internet, onde se incluem publicações eliminadas das redes sociais, notícias apagadas ou investigações por supostas “notícias falsas”. Ainda assim, esta segunda-feira a 'hashtag' da conferência de imprensa já havia ultrapassado 682 milhões de visualizações na Weibo.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavirus deaths rise to six in Seattle area as U.S. pushes for more testing.

Tests were being conducted on about 200 samples a day, and health officials expect to boost the number of tests to at least 1,000 a day soon.\nDuchin said his county was not recommending school closures or cancellation of any events.\nAs of Sunday, the number of confirmed and presumptive cases in the United States had risen to 91, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.

The CDC will confirm the tests sent by states with their own diagnostics. So far, 10 states, including California and New York, have confirmed or presumed cases.\nU.S. stock markets briefly pared gains following the announcement of an increase in fatalities but closed higher - the S&P 500 by 4.6%, the Dow Jones by 5% and the NASDAQ by 4.5%.

The United States appeared poised for a spike in cases, partly because there would be more testing to confirm infections.\nProtective gear and test kits were being distributed to U.S. military facilities with a priority on distribution to the Korean Peninsula, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army General Mark Milley, said at a briefing.\nSouth Korea is one of the hardest hit countries with 4,335 cases and 26 deaths.\nU.S. government military laboratories were working to develop a vaccine, Milley said.\nTrump said his administration has asked pharmaceutical companies to accelerate work on the development of a coronavirus vaccine, but provided no details.\nTop U.S. health officials have said any vaccine is up to 18 months away and there is no treatment for the respiratory disease, although patients can receive supportive care.\nU.S. health secretary Alex Azar said the administration is working on supply chain challenges for pharmaceutical companies in response to coronavirus as many active ingredients come from China.\nThe White House is also expected to meet this week with top executives from U.S. airlines and the cruise industry over the impact of the virus to their businesses, two people briefed on the matter said.\nAs early as this week, the U.S. Congress could debate and pass emergency funding, possibly in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion, to help battle the virus and aid businesses.\n"}, {"content": "UPDATE 1-Hong Kong leader increases funds to tackle coronavirus.

Phone calls to the vendor went unanswered, and attempts to connect to its social media accounts were rejected. \n The Beijing News published a photo on Tuesday showing the same vendor's now-shuttered store front, as authorities in white hazmat suits milled about. \n  \n The paper also quoted other merchants as saying trade in wildlife took place up until the market was shuttered for disinfection shortly after the outbreak. \n A number of the early sufferers of the virus, now known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), were employees of the market. \n VIRUS 'SPILLOVER' \n Many exotic species are still widely consumed in China or other Asian countries where they are considered a delicacy - like the civet or some rats or bats - or for purported health benefits. \n But this brings growing human health risks, said Christian Walzer, executive director of the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society's Health Program. \n Walzer said 70 per cent of all new infectious diseases come from wildlife, with habitat encroachment increasing the chances of pathogens spreading. \n  \n \"Wildlife markets offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spill over from wildlife hosts,\" he said. \n \"It is essential to invest resources not only into discovering new viruses, but more importantly, in determining the epidemiological drivers of ... (the) spillover, amplification, and spread of infectious diseases.\" \n Bats are thought to have spawned SARS, which in 2002-03 killed hundreds of people in Asia, mostly China. \n SARS was also found in civets in wildlife markets in China, with many scientists believing the bat virus infected the cat-like creatures and then humans who ate them. \n Following SARS, China cracked down on consumption of civets and some other species, but conservationists say the trade continues. \n China has so far won praise for its openness and handling of the current outbreak in stark contrast to SARS, when it was accused of stifling information and failing to cooperate with the rest of the world. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram \n "}, {"content": "coronavirus cases in china's hubei fall for second day, apple and markets feel impact. BEIJING/GENEVA - New coronavirus cases in the Chinese province at the epicentre of the outbreak fell for a second straight day, but deaths rose after the World Health Organization had cautioned there was not yet enough data to know if the epidemic had slowed.  \n Hubei reported 1,693 new cases as of Tuesday, down from 1,807 the previous day and the lowest number in the province since Feb. 11. But deaths rose by 132, up from 93 the previous day. The latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to over 74,000 with about 2,000 deaths.  \n The head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, died of the disease, becoming one of the most prominent victims since the novel virus first appeared at the end of last year.  \n Illustrating the impact of the outbreak on worldwide growth and corporate profits, oil prices tumbled and equity markets slid after Apple Inc issued a revenue warning due to the disruption the disease is causing to global supply chains.  \n World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Chinese data \"appears to show a decline in new cases\" but any apparent trend \"must be interpreted very cautiously.\"  \n Outside China, there have been 827 cases of the disease, known as COVID-19, and five deaths, according to a Reuters count based on official statements. More than half of those cases have been on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan.  \n Tedros said there had been 92 cases of human-to-human spread of the coronavirus in 12 countries outside China.  \n \"We have not seen sustained local transmission of coronavirus except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship,\" he said.  \n Russia, however, was taking no chances. Starting on Thursday, it will suspend entry of many Chinese citizens.  \n By the end of this week, the WHO said, 40 countries in Africa and 29 in the Americas are due to have the ability to detect COVID-19.  \n \"Many of these countries have been sending samples to other countries for testing, waiting several days for results. Now they can do it themselves within 24-48 hours,\" Tedros said.  \n China says figures indicating a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.  \n The WHO's Mike Ryan said China had success with \"putting out the fire\" first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday are monitored.  \n \"Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one,\" Ryan said  \n The numbers appear encouraging, said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Britain's University of Edinburgh, who described himself as cautious.  \n Chinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to fall victim. The hospital was designated solely for treating virus-infected patients.  \n  \n GLOBAL REPERCUSSIONS  \n Despite global concerns about the economic impact of the disease, China's ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday this would be \"limited, short-term and manageable\" and that Beijing had enough resources to step in if needed.  \n Chinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020 despite the epidemic.  \n Economists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon.  \n \"The employment situation is OK in the first quarter, but if the virus is not contained by end-March, then from the second quarter, we'll see a big round of layoffs,\" said Dan Wang, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Job losses could run as high as 4.5 million, he forecast.  \n Britain's biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks because of the coronavirus.  \n Components made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world, and Hubei province is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments.  \n South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the economy there was in an emergency situation and required stimulus as the epidemic had disrupted demand for South Korean goods.  \n Singapore announced a $4.5 billion financial package to help contain the outbreak in the city-state and weather its economic impact.  \n Japan, where the economy was already shrinking and the epidemic has created fears of recession, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to put limits on public crowds while some companies are telling employees to work from home.

Vinaya Chandran knew exactly what he wanted to do even before he was released from the army quarantine camp in Manesar, Har­yana eat a home-cooked meal with his family in his hometown Alappuzha in Kerala. The camp has looked after us well. We have all become close friends. But the food is not what I am used to, says the 31-year-old medical student from Wuhan University, China. He and the 647 other Indians evacuated from Wuhan on January 30 and February 1 in two batches were released on February 19 after they tested negative for the Novel Coronavirus (nCoV). However, to avoid taking chances, each person has been home quarantined for an additional 14 days, with their respective district hospitals monitoring the situation. With over 80,239 cases worldwide and 2,700 deaths (as of February 26), the human cost of nCoV has been making headlines since December 2019, and no country wants to take the threat lightly. The virus was first identified as nCoV, then changed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and finally named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization.\nThe devastating effects of a virus pandemic are being felt all the more by the global community this time around, because of the visual outpouring from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. This is not a tragedy happening in a forgotten corner of the planet. It is unfolding in the heart of the world’s largest economy. Footage of helpless residents not being able to come close to their own family and desperate foreigners begging to return to their home countries have been doing the rounds for over two months. In India, the impact of nCoV has been considerably small, with just three confirmed outbreaks in Kerala. All of whom have now recovered and are under medical supervision. The state has experienced virus outbreaks before and its health department began precautionary measures for nCoV even before they were implemented at a national level.\nIndia might have escaped nCoV, but given the worrying trend of virus outbreaks every few years, we need to ask do we have a system in place to handle a Wuhan-sized pandemic?\nThe burden of control and eradication of disease when it reaches alarming proportions does not fall entirely on a country’s health system. It is supported by various other agencies. While in India, the ministry of health and family welfare is the nodal ministry handling biological and health emergencies, such crises also come under the purview of disaster management agencies, the ministry of home affairs and the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC). India has pioneered the Delhi Declaration on Emergency Preparedness’ which identifies risks, implements disaster risk reduction measures and prepares and operationalises readiness for a broad range of disasters, including diseases and outbreaks, says Professor S.S. Vasan, an Indian-origin scientist who is leading the vaccine development against the nCoV at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia.\nHowever, for a long time, disaster management in India followed no defined path and remained an informal state subject, since after the Bengal famine of 1943 it was assumed that the only disasters India could face would be related to food shortages. There was no mention of disaster management in the Constitution as a state or a central subject. Despite such calamities as the 1950 Assam earthquake or the Bhopal gas disaster of 1984, it was only after the 2001 Bhuj earthquake and the setting up of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in 2005 that disaster management protocols and policies were evolved. An outbreak of nCoV, a biological disaster, would be part of Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. As such the states or the health ministry can request additional assistance from the NDMA, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) as well as the armed forces.\nA NATION ALERTED\nThe standard procedure for a health emergency would start at the point of outbreak, then be tackled from a state perspective and, finally, be seen through a national lens. However, when the threat is coming from an international source, like nCoV, the system is reversed. The first level of action is national to prevent the virus from reaching Indian soil.\nIndia’s initial response to nCoV was slow compared to other countries. The outbreak in Wuhan began to show signs of a serious epidemic in early January, and the European countries, Singapore, Japan and the US began to trace and isolate their China returnees almost immediately. In India, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) only monitors public health. We are yet to establish an organisation meant to watch health emergencies around the world, a practice followed by many countries in the West. As a result, India began rolling out its emergency health machinery to tackle nCoV only by the end of January.\nA group of ministers (GoM) was constituted on the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 30 and held its first meeting on February 3 for the management of nCoV. Members included the Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, minister of civil aviation Hardeep S. Puri, external affairs minister S. Jaishankar, minister of state for home G. Kishan Reddy, minister of state for health and family welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey, and minister of state for shipping Mansukh Lal Mandaviya.\nFollowing the first meeting, the health ministry addressed four key issues a risk advisory, travel screening, lab testing and quarantine facilities. Screening posts were set up at 21 international airports and 12 major ports. Staff at these entry points were trained to screen for possible infections after the Ebola outbreak in 2014, when the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) outlined the roles of health officers at airports to handle future infections. Passengers from suspected routes are given a leaflet to check if they are displaying certain symptoms and then screened on deboarding. Immigration officers and security personnel have been sensitised on how to handle passengers and equipped with personal protection equipment. Around 4,214 flights and 448,449 passengers have been screened till date.\nThe second step was to isolate China returnees and suspected cases. A total of 23,259 people have been brought under community surveillance. Every state is equipped with a rapid response team and government hospitals in each district are marked as isolation wards. The health teams can also ask for private hospitals to be on standby in Delhi, for instance, both RML Hospital and Safdarjung Hospital have 25-bed isolation wards for nCoV cases. In case of a pandemic, hospitals will suspend regular work, which takes up about 80 per cent of the beds, to accommodate more patients, says Dr Jagdish Prasad, former director general of health services. Zika and Ebola, he says, were major turning points for health emergency services in India. We started to rethink our requirements for disease control at a national level, adds Prasad, who is also the founder principal of Safdarjung Hospital and presently a principal consultant with the DGHS.\nThe National Institute for Virology (NIV) Pune, one of the 15 global laboratories identified by the WHO to provide reference testing for the nCoV, was also put on alert. Though India has a long way to go for native virological studies and vaccine development teams, we are not too far behind either in terms of laboratory training and testing. The US’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, has been training lab staff in India to handle, test and identify viruses. The NCDC, too, is equipped to support labs in testing. There are 105 viral research and diagnostic labs across India to support NIV if needed. For nCoV, 2,707 samples have been sent so far to NIV for a full report; only three from Kerala have tested positive.\nThe health ministry has issued advisories for the public, health workers and airport and lab staff, including travel and discharge advisories, guidelines for managing infected persons, isolating patients, and packaging and transporting test samples.\nDISASTER MANAGEMENT AGENCIES ON STAND BY\nIn the event that a health outbreak is identified as a national threat, each state has a disease surveillance programme which sends a daily report to the NCMC and the NDMA. The latter then view the crisis from a national and inter-state perspective and work with state teams to recommend measures, check resources and connect states to border and central agencies, if needed. The first step was to have screenings at all porous and non-porous borders, and identify isolation wards. In Kerala, for example, there were two hospitals in each district where isolation wards for nCoV cases were set up, says Saurabh Dalal, consultant for medical preparedness and biological disasters, NDMA, who was in Kerala to monitor nCoV management. Going forward, we plan to have a pandemic preparedness plan for each district. Only when all community resources have been exhausted will assistance from NDRF be requested. As it was during the Nipah outbreak of 2018, the NDRF is on stand-by were nCoV to turn into a serious health pandemic. The NDRF functions as a force of assistance to states under the assumption that there is a requisition made, says S.N. Pradhan, director general of NDRF. We have 12 battalions and 18 specialised teams, two of which are specifically trained to handle biological emergencies. Once nCoV was identified as a possible threat, we distributed about 100 suits to our battalions and sent our doctors to sensitise the immigration bureau that would be dealing directly with passengers from high-risk routes. In China, a 1,000-bed hospital was set up within 10 days and Wuhan was cordoned off. In India, the army can rapidly deploy such resources and shut down a state if needed. But it can be decided only at the cabinet level, along with the ministry of home affairs, says Pradhan.\nSTATE ACTION PLAN\nStates can use disaster response funds from the NDMA to detect and handle a crisis. Each state is also equipped with district emergency centres, and district magistrates become incident commanders. A private limited company under the state health department and the National Health Mission maintains stockpiles of personal protection equipment, masks and biological suits.\nKerala became the first state to declare a state emergency for a public health disaster. It was lifted within the first week of February. Widely praised for its handling of the nCoV crisis, not only did Kerala ensure mass isolation for suspected cases, it also made sure that 4 million children in schools were educated about the virus. Special advisories were issued for the blind, elderly, illiterate, differently-abled and health workers (demographic segments often overlooked during disaster communication). However, it is important to note state discrepancies in cases of health crises. Kerala enjoys a better quality of public healthcare and better health indicators than several northern states. Not every state has the capacity to handle a virus outbreak in the same manner. The NDMA has plans to document Kerala’s management of nCoV as a future example to other states.\nOverall, our health disaster management largely rests on short-term steps for control and eradication. The long-term repercussions still need to be considered. There are other aspects of a pandemic that could have crippling effects on morale and economy. Food shortages, financial loss, miscommunication and human rights abuse are aspects of disaster management that have never been handled before. The 2003 SARS outbreak, for instance, is estimated to have resulted in global economic losses to the tune of $30-100 billion, according to the Asian Development Bank; nCoV is predicted to have a similar impact.\nAnother loophole in the system is the presence of multiple agencies the health and home ministries, NCMC, NDMA, NDRF, NCDC and state health departments each with a stake in biological disaster management. Having too many bureaucratic players inevitably leads to longer decision time, confusion and overlap in responsibilities. While we have the guidelines on paper, real life implementation is an altogether different story.\n"}, {"content": "a black swan arrives: investors keep watch as covid-19 outbreak changes market sentiments. The coronavirus outbreak has been very much in the news and, apart from its impact on public health and the economy, is also affecting investments. \n Investors should position their portfolio carefully and watch markets closely during this period. \n IMPACT ON STOCK MARKETS \n Concerns about the Covid-19 coronavirus in various countries continue to roil the markets with a heavy dose of volatility, financial advisory firm ETF Database observed. \n British newspaper The Guardian reported that financial markets remain confident the crisis will soon blow over, as share prices have been rebounding because investors think the coronavirus can be contained. \n Yet, it also noted that Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser to insurance company Allianz, thinks that the economic damage could be a black swan event equivalent to the collapse of the US sub-prime mortgage market. \n Black swan events is a term popularised by writer Nassim Taleb and based on a saying that black swans did not exist (until they were discovered in the wild). \n They are events that come as a complete surprise, have profound consequences and are rationalised by people who never saw the crisis coming and who then say after the fact that it was glaringly obvious that there was trouble ahead.  \n The epidemic in China caused by coronavirus Covid-19 and the infections spreading in other countries have already become a black swan event for the Asia-Pacific tourism industry, business information company IHS Markit says. It could hit other sectors as well. \n MARKET FORECASTS \n While investors understandably want to know what to do at this time of uncertainty. financial advisory firm Evergreen Gavekal’s adviser Arthur Kroebel says that it is a “fool’s errand” to come up with highly specific forecasts for the ultimate impact on Chinese, regional or global gross domestic product (GDP) given the uncertainties involved. \n If it does turn into a global pandemic, he said, global supply chains would face more disruption, commodity prices would fall more severely, and central banks would face pressure to offset the impact.  \n Already, though, financial services firm ING expects that potential spreading of the virus across the globe could last until March or April and mark a new downside risk to the global economy in the first half of 2020. \n Investment bank JP Morgan said that the coronavirus remains in its early stages and “is likely to worsen before getting better”. \n Here in Singapore, DBS bank said that the outbreak has thrown the Singapore economy a curveball. \n Supply chain disruptions such as extended factory closures within China will have a significant impact on Singapore’s manufacturing sector, for example, and consumer spending is expected to be dampened as residents take more precautionary actions in their daily lives. \n As a result, “we are downgrading our 2020 real GDP forecast to 0.9% (from 1.4%) in response to the potential impact. The concern is that the impact could be deeper than Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome).” \n Over in Hong Kong, The Guardian said that the economy risks being plunged deeper into recession as the outbreak wreaks havoc, with consumers panic-buying staple goods and airlines stopping flights.   POSITION YOUR PORTFOLIO PROTECTIVELY \n Amid all these uncertainties, a key question for investors is how to position their investment portfolio well and prepare effectively for whatever the next several months may bring. \n “When you don’t know,” Mr Ray Dalio, founder of hedge-fund giant Bridgewater Associates told MarketWatch, “the best investment strategy is to be smartly diversified across geographic locations, asset classes, and currencies.” \n So far, he said, “fears of the spreading coronavirus have triggered a ‘flight-to-quality’ that continues to pressure stocks while giving a lift to hedges such as gold, bonds and the (US) dollar.” \n British financial research firm Trustnet similarly said that some investors have started taking more defensive positions, with government bonds and gold being preferred options. \n For stocks, it could be advantageous to avoid vulnerable companies in the tourism sector such as airlines and cruise lines or hotels and to buy companies such as e-commerce or food delivery firms that will benefit even if consumers stay at home. \n Investors can also benefit by taking advantage of shifts in the market. \n While JPMorgan Chase analysts noted that previous global health scares such as Sars and Zika did not unsettle equities for an extended period, the MSCI Hong Kong index lost about 9 per cent during the Sars epidemic and then jumped17 per cent in the three months after the disease faded from view. \n Investment brokerage Schwab similarly said that although there is always a chance that this outbreak could have greater consequences, the global economy and markets have been relatively immune to the effects of past viral epidemics. “A short-term dip in stocks tended to be followed by the continuation of the upward trend,” it said. \n While there is uncertainty about the impact on investments and a panicked rush to buy less risky assets is not appropriate, investors would be well-advised to examine their portfolio and ensure that it is sufficiently diversified. \n Given the uncertainties, it could also be advisable to take a more defensive posture than usual over the next several months and increase the allocation to investments in bonds while reducing the allocation to stocks and potentially shifting the types of stocks in the portfolio. \n Even though the timing of an upturn is uncertain, watching trends and taking advantage of dips to buy if markets rebound could also be beneficial. \n "}, {"content": "Barcelona doa 30.000 máscaras às autoridades de saúde da Catalunha.

These include: \n Mandatory temperature taking and declaration of travel history, health and contact details for contact tracing by all visitors to Safra clubs and activities with strict entry requirements. All employees at the club are also required to take their temperature twice daily, and seek medical attention and stay home if they have any flu-like symptoms or are unwell. \n Increased cleaning of frequently touched surfaces to once hourly. \n Frequency of cleaning at common areas tripled, along with the provision of hand sanitisers. \n Health advisories displayed at all Safra clubs and emailed to members to encourage good personal hygiene practices to keep the community safe. \n On Monday, MOH said that there are 36 people who have contracted the virus and are linked to a private dinner function held at Safra Jurong on Feb 15.

SINGAPORE - Singapore banks' loan growth will slow to 1.5 per cent in 2020, down from 3.1 per cent last year, given the stiff economic headwinds facing Singapore from the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, Fitch Solutions Macro Research forecast in a report released on Friday (Feb 14). \n The likelihood of a more pronounced slowdown is likely to weigh on credit demand, with businesses across a broad range of sectors including retail, tourism and the export-oriented manufacturing sector, likely to encounter tougher conditions as a result of the cornavirus epidemic around the world, said the research firm. It nopted that Singapore banks have already been contending with a contraction in consumer loan growth. \n Furthermore, likely monetary easing from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) would prevent interest rates from falling too far to offset lower credit demand, it said. \n Fitch Solutions said that while interest rates would normally fall in order to adjust to lower credit demand, Singapore is likely to undergo monetary easing in 2020 in a bid to support the economy, especially the exporting sectors, limiting the extent to which this is possible. \n Unlike other countries which use interest rates as the policy lever, Singapore uses the exchange rate instead. Easing monetary policy under such a system tends instead to have an upward effect on interest rates as they would adjust to maintain the attractiveness of assets denominated in the Singapore dollar, all other things equal. Therefore, as the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor) rises in tandem with a weaker Singapore dollar, banks will find it hard to lower their rates significantly to bolster credit demand, further weighing on loan growth. Sibor is a key benchmark rate to price most home loans here. \n Its report comes a day after DBS flagged the risks to its earnings from the virus outbreak as it announced quarterly and full-year results.. CEO Piyush Gupta said that if the outbreak is controlled by the summer,  the hit to revenue could be 1 to 2 per cent. OCBC and United Overseas Bank are set to announce their results on Feb 21. \n Fitch Solutions observed that loan growth last year was due to a recovery in lending to businesses that began in April 2019, in line with Singapore's stronger economic performance towards the latter half of 2019. But consumer loans (around 40 per cent of total loans) remained in contraction last year, mostly a reflection of the cooling property market and by extension, slower mortgage growth. \n However, the recovery in business loans (around 60 per cent of all loans) is unlikely to be sustainable in 2020 given that Singapore's open economy is heavily exposed to the likely deeper slowdown in the Chinese economy from the Covid-19 outbreak, said Fitch Solutions. It has revised down China's 2020 real GDP growth to 5.6 per cent from 5.9 per cent. \n \"As a result, our current 2020 real GDP growth forecast of 1.7 per cent for Singapore is exposed to heavy downside risks, and we will revisiting this figure over the coming weeks,\" said the firm. \n The report also noted that Singapore's export-oriented manufacturing sector is closely tied to those of China's economy and that the outbreak will hit a sector already weakened by the ongoing US-China trade war and the slowdown in China. Singapore's non-oil domestic exports posted 12 straight months of contraction at an average pace of 10.8 per cent year on year between December 2018 and November 2019, it calculated. \n It also said the tourism and related hospitality and retail sectors in Singapore will take a hit, not just from the plunge in Chinese visitors, who make up 18.5 per cent of arrivals here, but also as the climbing infection toll in Singapore and the Orange outbreak response level likely deters visitors from other countries as well. \n Fitch Solutions is part of the Fitch Group, which also comprises credit rating agency Fitch Ratings. \n "}, {"content": "Two Malaysian evacuees from Wuhan positive for coronavirus - Health Minister.

It’s quite devastating,” he said. \n In 2019, three flight routes within Asean were among the world’s top five busiest flight routes of the whole year, according to travel data provider OAG. \n The Singapore-Kuala Lumpur route topped the list at 30,187 flights, while the Singapore-Jakarta route came in third at 27,046 flights. \n The Kuala Lumpur-Jakarta route took fifth spot at 19.741 flights every year. \n Already, Singapore has progressively banned travellers from China, Iran, Italy, France, Germany, South Korea and Spain from entering the country. \n These newest restrictions on Asean nationals, would “kill a lot of business travel”, said Mr Terence Wong, founder of Azure Capital. \n “Most of them are intra-Asean travel, probably just in the country a day or two right? There is no reason why you want to be subjected to a 14-day stay-at-home requirement,” he said. \n Ms Pan Jingyi, market strategist at IG, said that the market selloff is not just due to restrictions imposed in Singapore. \n Australia and New Zealand, which are destinations close to Asean, have also put up restrictions as part of their containment efforts. \n “There is a consolidated effort across the board,” she said. \n Yet while the market is down dramatically, analysts to whom TODAY spoke said investors should exercise caution and not rush in just because share prices look very cheap. \n While Asian countries, such as Singapore, are generally perceived to be doing a better job at containing the Covid-19 outbreak, Ms Pan noted that financial markets here are still influenced externally, particularly with what’s going on in the United States. \n Over the past week, financial markets in the US have suffered whiplash, rising and falling dramatically — but the net movement is a huge dive, from above 29,000 points in mid February to just above 22,000 in early trading on Monday. \n Last Thursday, the US market suffered its single largest percentage fall — 9.5 per cent — since Oct 19, 1987 when the US market lost 25 per cent in a single session. \n “The outlook for the US market in the short-term, and I mean in the next one month, the outlook is not so positive. I don’t recommend trying to catch this falling knife at this point in time,” said Ms Pan. \n Mr Wong also warned not to jump into the market as there might be more downside risk in the future. \n However, Mr Chew said it is a good time to buy though his advice would be to pace the investments as the situation is still deteriorating. \n “The market will remain weak until we reach a peak in the number of new patients… Whenever the numbers rise, the market will take it that the detrimental economic impact will be more entrenched,” he said. \n “The positive side is we see that the virus can be contained but at the cost of huge economic damage.” \n   \n "}, {"content": "Was, wenn das Virus Afrika erreicht?. Vier Kontinente hat das neue Coronavirus schon erreicht: Von China aus haben Menschen es in andere Teile Asiens getragen, nach Australien, Europa und Nordamerika. In Afrika aber ist es noch nicht angekommen. Doch was, wenn? Der Erreger, der schon 500 Menschen getötet und Zigtausende infiziert hat, würde hier auf Länder treffen, deren Gesundheitssysteme so schwach sind wie vielleicht nirgendwo anders auf der Welt. Im schlimmsten Falle könnte das eine Epidemie mit Hunderttausenden Infizierten und vielen Tausenden Toten bedeuten. Denn viele Regionen im Afrika südlich der Sahara haben schon heute große Probleme: Epidemien von Malaria, HIV und Tuberkulose und eine Zunahme von chronischen Erkrankungen wie Diabetes und Bluthochdruck schwächen nicht nur die Menschen, sondern überlasten Länder, in denen es an Kliniken, Ärztinnen, Pflegern und medizinischer Versorgung fehlt.\nAuch wenn sie sich mit Zahlen und Vorhersagen schwertun, viele Experten haben vor diesem Szenario große Angst. Auf der Sitzung des Exekutivrats der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO am 3. Februar sei die Stimmung unter den afrikanischen Mitgliedstaaten sehr nervös gewesen, berichten Anwesende. Und John Nkengasong, der die erst vor drei Jahren gegründete Seuchenschutzbehörde der Afrikanischen Union leitet, sagte ZEIT ONLINE zwischen zwei Telefonkonferenzen: \"Wir sind mit einer beispiellosen Gefahr konfrontiert.\"\nNoch bei der Sars-Epidemie 2003 waren die Staaten von Afrika südlich der Sahara weitestgehend verschont geblieben, nur Südafrika registrierte einen einzigen Fall. Beim neuen Coronavirus aber sollte niemand hoffen, dass es so glimpflich abläuft – zu eng sind die Verbindungen zwischen China und vielen afrikanischen Staaten geworden. Hunderttausende chinesische Gastarbeiter arbeiten auf dem afrikanischen Kontinent, Tausende afrikanische Studentinnen und Studenten reisen jährlich mit einem Uni-Stipendium nach China. Der Flugverkehr von Afrika nach China und zurück hat sich in den vergangenen zehn Jahren versiebenfacht.\nEnde 2019 meldeten die chinesischen Behörden der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO eine Häufung von Lungenentzündungen unklarer Ursache in der zentralchinesischen Stadt Wuhan. Bereits eine Woche später identifizierten chinesische Forscher ein neuartiges Virus als Ursache der Krankheitsfälle. Es gehört zur Gruppe der Coronaviren. Wenige Tage darauf veröffentlichte eine Gruppe um den Virologen Christian Drosten von der Berliner Charité den ersten diagnostischen Test für das neue Virus, das Forscher provisorisch 2019-nCoV nennen. Mit dem Test kann das Virus im Labor nachgewiesen werden. Als Quelle des Erregers vermuten die chinesischen Behörden einen Lebensmittelmarkt in Wuhan, auf dem neben Fisch und Meeresfrüchten auch exotische Tiere wie Schlangen verkauft wurden. Der Markt wurde geschlossen und desinfiziert.\nSowohl die Atemwegserkrankungen Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) als auch Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) werden von Coronaviren verursacht, die ihren Ursprung in Tieren haben. Während der Sars-Pandemie infizierten sich in den Jahren 2002 und 2003 etwa 8.000 Menschen, mehr als 750 starben. Mit dem Mers-Virus haben sich seit seiner Entdeckung 2012 bis zum Jahresende 2019 etwa 2.500 Menschen angesteckt, jeder Dritte ist daran gestorben. Insgesamt gibt es aber mehrere Hundert Arten von Coronaviren. Viele von ihnen betreffen die Atemwege und können zum Beispiel Erkältungen verursachen.\nIn China sind inzwischen mehrere Tausend Personen erkrankt, einige von ihnen – die meisten wohl mit Vorerkrankungen – sind an einer Lungenentzündung infolge des Virus gestorben. Die ersten Infektionsfälle außerhalb Chinas wurden in Thailand, Japan und Südkorea bekannt. Es handelt sich um Reisende, die vorher in Wuhan gewesen waren. Am 21. Januar meldeten US-Behörden die erste Infektion bei einem Touristen, der aus Wuhan zurückkam, am 24. Januar wurden die ersten Fälle in Frankreich bekannt. Mittlerweile wurden auch erste Fälle in Deutschland bestätigt. Typische Zeichen einer Infektion sind Fieber, Husten und Atembeschwerden. Das Virus kann eine Lungenentzündung verursachen, die tödlich enden kann. Da es sich um eine virale Krankheit handelt, helfen Antibiotika nicht.\nInzwischen ist klar, dass das Virus von Mensch zu Mensch übertragen werden kann. Chinesische Behörden haben mehrere solcher Übertragungen bestätigt, nachdem auch etwa ein Dutzend Fälle bei medizinischem Personal bekannt wurden. Medizinerinnen und Mediziner gehen davon aus, dass das Virus vor allem über Tröpfcheninfektion übertragen wird. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation rechnet, wie sie am 24. Januar mitteilte, momentan damit, dass ein Infizierter im Schnitt 1,4 bis 2,5 andere Menschen ansteckt. Bewahrheiten sich diese Zahlen, ist das Virus weniger ansteckend als Sars und auch die Virusgrippe. Die WHO empfiehlt generelle Hygieneregeln zu beachten: Man solle sich häufig die Hände waschen und engen Kontakt zu Personen mit Atemwegserkrankungen und wilden Tieren meiden.\nDas lässt sich noch nicht mit Sicherheit sagen. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation teilte am 28. Januar mit, dass ungefähr ein Fünftel der gemeldeten Fälle durch das Virus schwer krank werde, im Zweifelsfall also intensivmedizinisch behandelt werden muss. Berichten zufolge handelte es sich bei den ersten Todesopfern um Patienten, die teils schwere Vorerkrankungen hatten. Auch bei anderen Infektionskrankheiten sind Menschen mit Vorerkrankungen besonders gefährdet – etwa bei der Grippe. Coronaviren sind dafür bekannt, dass sie mutieren, also ihr Erbgut verändern können. Das kann dazu führen, dass sie im Laufe eines Ausbruchs gefährlicher für Menschen werden – aber auch zum genauen Gegenteil. Das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) erwartet zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt keine ähnlich hohe Mortalität wie beim Ausbruch von Sars.\nViele Länder des Kontinents haben starke wirtschaftliche Beziehungen zu China. Kenia und Äthiopien etwa. Für Äthiopien ist China mit einem Handelsvolumen von mehr als fünf Milliarden US-Dollar der wichtigste Wirtschaftspartner. In Kenia sponserte die chinesische Regierung eines der größten Infrastrukturprojekte in der Geschichte des Landes, einen Hochgeschwindigkeitszug, der die Hauptstadt Nairobi mit der Küstenmetropole Mombasa verbindet. Der Zug ist Teil der Neuen Seidenstraßeninitiative, die der chinesische Präsident Xi Jinping 2013 ins Leben rief. Um weltweit Handelsstützpunkte aufzubauen, investiert China Billionen Euro in Infrastrukturprojekte.\nUnd sowohl in Äthiopien als auch in Kenia gab es vergangene Woche gleich mehrere Coronavirus-Verdachtsfälle, erzählt Michel Yao, der bei der WHO Afrika für Notfallprogramme zuständig ist, am Telefon. \"Wir hatten schon viele Alarme\", sagt Yao. Das sei aber ein gutes Zeichen, denn es zeige, dass die Überwachungssysteme an vielen Orten funktionierten.\nAber stimmt das? Oder gibt es in einzelnen afrikanischen Staaten längst Fälle, die niemand registriert hat? Ein 2019 erschienener Bericht des Global Preparedness Monitoring Boards zumindest fand weltweite Lücken in der Vorbereitung auf Epidemien und eine Untersuchung des Center for Health Security der Johns Hopkins Universität zeigte: Die am schlechtesten vorbereiteten Länder finden sich fast alle in Afrika. Eigentlich mangele es an allem: an Laboren, um Erreger nachzuweisen, an Isolationsräumen und an Personal.\nAber der Reihe nach: Um eine Epidemie möglichst schon im Keim zu ersticken, braucht es zunächst gute Meldesysteme. Denn je schneller Fälle aufgespürt werden, desto weniger Menschen können die Infizierten anstecken. John Nkengasong sagt, die Afrikanische Seuchenschutzbehörde habe bereits eine Taskforce eingerichtet, die die Länder dabei unterstützen soll. Außerdem solle jedes Land eine schnelle Eingreiftruppe vorhalten, und schon heute würde an allen Flughäfen nach Infizierten gesucht, mit Fragebögen und Temperaturscannern. Ein derartiges Screening würde wegen des seit eineinhalb Jahren andauernden Ebola-Ausbruchs im Kongo ohnehin durchgeführt.\nWie gut diese Maßnahmen im Falle eines Coronafalles wirklich greifen, ist aber schwer zu sagen. Es hängt sicher auch davon ab, welches Land in Subsahara-Afrika es mit den ersten Coronavirusfällen zu tun bekommt. Manche Länder – wie etwa Ghana oder Nigeria – sind darauf besser vorbereitet als Regionen, in denen Krieg herrscht und Regierungen instabil sind, etwa der Südsudan oder die Zentralafrikanische Republik. Dort etwa dürfte das Virus nahezu freie Bahn haben.\nAuch das Ausfindigmachen neuer Fälle wird nicht leicht sein, sagt Gérard Krause vom Helmholtz-Zentrum für Infektionsforschung: \"In weiten Teilen Afrikas denken die Menschen erst einmal an Malaria, wenn jemand Fieber hat.\" Es gehe also auch darum, Gesundheitsfachkräfte zu schulen, dass sich nun neben Erkrankungen wie Malaria, Lassa, Ebola und einer Hirnhautentzündung durch Meningokokken auch das Coronavirus hinter einem Fieberschub verstecken könne.\nKrause hilft seit 2017 in Nigeria und zuletzt auch in Ghana ein System einzurichten, das Sormas heißt. Man muss es sich als eine Plattform vorstellen, die alle Beteiligten eines Gesundheitssystems digital miteinander verbindet: das Labor, den Distriktarzt, die Gesundheitshelferin auf dem Dorf und die Gesundheitsbehörde. Wenn zum Beispiel eine Gesundheitshelferin den Verdacht auf eine Infektion mit dem neuen Coronavirus hat, dies auf einem Tablet hinterlegt und eine Blutprobe nimmt, erklärt Krause, passieren verschiedene Dinge gleichzeitig: Das Labor wird benachrichtigt, dass eine Probe auf dem Weg ist. Die Gesundheitsbehörden und der Distriktarzt bekommen einen Alarm und die Gesundheitshelferin wird angewiesen, den Verdachtsfall zu isolieren und nach Menschen zu suchen, mit denen er zu tun hatte.\nWenn es gelingt, einen Verdachtsfall zu finden, bleibt noch die Frage, wie er bestätigt wird. Anfang Februar gab es in ganz Afrika nur zwei Labore, die Proben von Patientinnen und Patienten auf das Virus 2019-nCoV testen. Die Proben eines Verdachtsfalles in der Elfenbeinküste mussten erst nach Europa geschickt werden, erklärte Michael Yao, ZEIT ONLINE. Es dauerte Tage, bis feststand: Fehlalarm. In den kommenden Tagen sollen in Subsahara-Afrika zwölf Labors den Test auf das neue Coronavirus machen können, sagt Yao. John Nkengasong geht davon aus, dass er bald in 15 bis 20 Ländern verfügbar sein wird.\nPatienten zügig zu finden und dann zu isolieren ist in weiten Teilen Afrikas noch viel wichtiger als anderswo. Denn die meisten Gesundheitssysteme Subsahara-Afrikas dürften zu schwach sein, um sich bei einem größeren Coronavirus-Ausbruch um die Erkrankten zu kümmern. Flächendeckende Quarantänestationen mit Beatmungsmaschinen, die im Fall einer schweren Lungenentzündung durch das Coronavirus gebraucht werden, gibt es nicht. Zudem gibt es in fast alle Länder Subsahara-Afrikas Fachkräftemangel. Während in Deutschland statistisch etwa 42 Ärztinnen und Ärzte auf 10.000 Menschen kommen, ist es in Äthiopien genau einer, in Somalia sogar nur 0,2*.\nIn vielen Ländern fehle es am Elementarsten, sagt die Politikwissenschaftlerin Ilona Kickbusch, die die Bundesregierung in globalen Gesundheitsfragen beraten hat: \"Das fängt schon beim Schutzkittel und Medikamenten an.\" Auch gebe es in vielen Ländern mit schwachen Gesundheitssystemen logistische Probleme. Atemmasken etwa in betroffene Gebiete zu bringen, kann dann Tage dauern – viel zu lang für das ansteckende Coronavirus.\nDie Schwäche mancher Gesundheitssysteme sei auch der Hauptgrund gewesen, einen internationalen Gesundheitsnotstand auszurufen, sagte der Generaldirektor der WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, am 30. Januar: \"Wir wissen nicht, was für einen Schaden dieses Virus anrichten kann, wenn es sich in ein Land mit einem schwächeren Gesundheitssystem ausbreitet. Wir müssen jetzt handeln, um uns auf diese Möglichkeit vorzubereiten.\"\nJohn Nkengasong sagt: \"Ich kann die internationale Gemeinschaft nur aufrufen, afrikanischen Ländern jetzt zu helfen – und nicht zu warten, bis der Kontinent komplett überwältigt ist.\" Einem Ausbruch wie in China würden die Gesundheitssysteme der meisten Staaten nicht standhalten.\nDie Gates-Stiftung, die seit Jahren Millionen in die globale Gesundheit investiert, hat Nkengansongs Behörde bereits 4,5 Millionen Euro zugesagt, um Maßnahmen gegen das neue Coronavirus zu ergreifen. Am 05. Februar erklärte die Stiftung dann, dass sie weitere 90 Millionen Euro investieren wolle, um das Coronavirus zu bekämpfen, ungefähr 18 Millionen davon sollen an afrikanische Länder gehen. Einige afrikanische Staaten wie etwa der Sudan baten am 04. Februar auf der Sitzung des Exeuktivrates der WHO explizit um Hilfe. \"Es ging dabei zum einen um Schulungen von Fachkräften zur Prävention und Behandlung des Coronavirus\", sagt Mathias Bonk vom Institut für Globale Gesundheit in Berlin. Und zum anderen darum, dass sie Materialien wie Test-Kits, Masken und Schutzanzüge bräuchten. Manche dieser Probleme soll ein eigens auf das neue Coronavirus zugeschnittener Strategieplan lösen, den die WHO diese Woche vorstellte.\nJohn Nkengansong von der afrikanischen Seuchenschutzbehörde hat außerdem mit der Weltbank gesprochen und die öffentlichen Gesundheitsbehörden der USA und China um logistische Hilfe gebeten. Gerade die US-Amerikaner hatten bei vergangenen Gesundheitskrisen in Subsahara-Afrika oft geholfen. Was aber, wenn die USA selbst einen schweren Coronavirus-Ausbruch erleben? Auch diese Angst treibt momentan viele um: Dass die klassischen Geberländer so sehr mit Ausbrüchen des Virus beschäftigt sein könnten, dass sie nicht mehr helfen.\nMichel Yao sagt, das WHO-Notfall-Team sei auch mit Nichtregierungsorganisationen wie dem Roten Kreuz und Ärzte ohne Grenzen in Kontakt. An einigen Orten könnten afrikanische Staaten, wenn das Virus sie erreicht, von solchen bereits bestehenden Partnerschaften profitieren. Im Fall der Fälle könnten dann zum Beispiel Ebola-Behandlungszentren im Kongo zu Orten umgewandelt werden, an denen Menschen mit einer Coronavirus-Infektion isoliert und therapiert werden.\nIlona Kickbusch betont aber auch, dass es nicht allein Geld und Hilfsgüter brauche, sondern auch eine Strategie, wie man Maßnahmen wie Quarantäne und Isolation von Patienten den Menschen in den betroffenen Gebieten erklärt. Bei vergangenen Ebola-Ausbrüchen stellte sich das als Problem heraus: Männer in gelben Schutzanzügen, so muss es sich vielen Dorfbewohnern dargestellt haben, kamen, nahmen gesunde Menschen mit und brachten Tote zurück. Natürlich entstanden dabei Verschwörungstheorien, was es den Behandlungsteams noch schwerer machte, das Vertrauen der Bevölkerung zu gewinnen.\nGérard Krause vom Helmholtz-Institut für Infektionsforschung ist derweil mit verschiedenen afrikanischen Staaten in Kontakt. Sie denken darüber nach, sein Sormas-System genau wie Ghana und Nigeria einzusetzen. Dort hat das System schon 2017 und 2018 geholfen, einen Affenpockenausbruch unter Kontrolle zu bekommen, sagt Krause. Selbst wenn es für das neue Coronavirus zu spät sein könnte: Eine nächste Epidemie mit einem neuen Erreger kommt bestimmt. Darauf sollte sich ein immer enger vernetztes Afrika vorbereiten.\nAlles zum neuen Coronavirus lesen Sie auf unserer Themenseite.\n*Korrekturhinweis: Zunächst war im Text die Angabe, wie viele Ärzte auf 10.000 Menschen im jeweiligen Land kommen falsch angegeben.

(Reuters) - Another group of nearly 350 Americans airlifted from the epicenter of China’s fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak were placed under quarantine at two military bases in California on Wednesday, as the number of confirmed U.S. cases of the disease rose to 12.\nThe travelers aboard two State Department-chartered cargo jets were met by personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for screening, and are to remain under mandatory quarantine for 14 days, the incubation period of the virus.\nFive of the passengers arrived exhibiting possible symptoms, two of them children, and were immediately hospitalized, along with the mother of one of the youngsters, the CDC said.\nThe latest evacuees, together with 195 Americans flown out of Wuhan, China, a week ago by the U.S. government, bring to 540 the number people subject so far to the CDC’s first public health quarantine in 50 years. Wuhan, in China’s Hubei province, is the epicenter of the disease.\nThe two planes in Wednesday’s airlift arrived at Travis Air Force Base in northern California, where 178 passengers from one plane disembarked to begin two weeks of round-the-clock health screening while barred from contact with the general public.\nNone of the group showed signs of disease, except for a small child who developed a fever during the flight and was taken to a nearby hospital with its mother for further testing and medical treatment in isolation, officials said. The other evacuees at Travis will be housed in a hotel on base.\nAfter refueling, the second evacuation plane flew on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, near San Diego, arriving with 167 passenger. Of that group, three adults and a child “were determined to have a fever or a cough that warranted them being transported to a local hospital for further evaluation,” the CDC said. The rest were placed under quarantine at two housing sites on base.\n“Because these individuals were in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, where there is intense and escalating community-wide spread of this novel coronavirus, we consider them at high risk of exposure,” said Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.\n“We are in a critical time period in the international spread of the virus, and this action is necessary to try to prevent the spread here,” Braden told reporters during a briefing at Miramar.\nHe stressed that the CDC’s strategy of early detection and containment of individuals who are sick or at high risk of exposure has been successful in preventing widespread transmission in the United States so far.\n“If there were ongoing community spread of this virus we would know it, and that’s not happening,” Braden said. “So right now, in the United States, communities across this country are at very low risk of being exposed to this virus, including in San Diego and including on this base.”\nThe United States and other countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate their citizens from China, where the coronavirus outbreak has killed more than 500 people, most in and around Wuhan, and infected more than 28,000.\nTwelve cases have been confirmed in the United States, none fatal. The latest patient, reported in Wisconsin on Wednesday, is isolated at home and “doing well,” the state health agency said in a statement.\nAs with nine other U.S. cases documented to date, that person fell ill after traveling to China and was exposed to known cases there, the state health department said. Just two confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases were transmitted person-to-person within the United States - both between spouses.\nThe protocols in place at Travis and Miramar were previously instituted at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles, where the first group of Americans airlifted from Wuhan landed last Wednesday and are midway through their quarantine.\nThe CDC said the government expects to fly additional groups of Americans and their families from China to other U.S. military bases designated for quarantine in Texas and Nebraska.\nAs part of a U.S. public health emergency declared on Jan. 31 in response to the coronavirus crisis, the Trump administration has barred U.S. entry of all foreign nationals who have recently visited China.\nThe CDC also has ordered a mandatory two-week quarantine for all U.S. travelers who have visited Wuhan or anywhere else in China’s Hubei Province during the past 14 days. Americans who traveled elsewhere in mainland China are subject to two weeks of self-quarantine and monitoring.\nAll commercial flights carrying Americans home from China will be directed to one of 11 U.S. international airports, where passengers will be screened by the CDC.\nThe State Department also has issued a “Do Not Travel” advisory warning U.S. citizens against visits to China.\n"}, {"content": "taiwan embraces cute mascots for virus prevention campaign. TAIPEI — While China deploys stern communist slogans in its battle against a deadly new coronavirus, democratic Taiwan has embraced cuddly mascots and humour to ease public anxiety and educate on best practices. \n Images of cute animals have featured in daily social media updates from government agencies to tackle disinformation and prevent the spread of infections. \n The health ministry has deployed a cartoon \"spokesdog\" — a Shiba Inu called Zongchai — that has proved a hit with hashtags of his name going viral and posts shared hundreds of thousands of times. \n Recent contributions have included advice on hygiene and quarantine regulations as well as reminding people to use face masks judiciously given the ongoing shortages since the new virus exploded in China. \n \"Leave face masks for the people who need them, frequently wash your hands with soap, reduce touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands,\" read one update.  \n A photo illustration shows a man displaying a smartphone with an image of a cartoon of Taiwan's Premier Su Tseng-chang promoting the prevention of the deadly Covid-19 coronavirus, in Taipei, on Feb 14, 2020.

Photo: AFP \n The island — which Beijing views as its own territory and keeps frozen out of the World Health Organization — recorded its first death on Sunday (Feb 16) but has kept confirmed infections to just 20. \n There was brief panic buying of face masks before authorities limited each person to just two face masks every seven days using health insurance cards. \n The island has also restricted the number of face masks a person can take abroad to 250. Last week, the coast guard stopped a fishing boat for attempting to smuggle out 71,000 masks. \n The ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which is loathed by Beijing for leaning towards Taiwanese independence, has been deft at deploying cute memes to win public support. \n President Tsai Ing-wen won a landslide second term in January after an election where she regularly featured as an anime-style cartoon character in campaign literature. \n In a similar vein, Premier Su Tseng-chang took to his social media accounts in cartoon form this week to warn against panic-buying toilet paper. \n \"We only have one butt, don't hoard, don't trust rumours,\" the post read.  \n Once again, a clever homophone was deployed. In Mandarin, the first characters for \"hoard\" and \"butt\" are pronounced the same. AFP \n "}, {"content": "Itália em alerta máximo com dois casos mortais de coronavírus.

When the severe acute respiratory (Sars) epidemic ended in 2003, many people in China thought that the government had learned its lesson. \n Sars was the most serious epidemic the country encountered in the reform era, killing 349 people in China. \n The government was roundly criticised for its cover-ups in the early phases of the epidemic, leading to some frantic bureaucratic reshuffles, greater transparency and an expensive control and prevention system for infectious diseases. \n In March 2019, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention Gao Fu confidently predicted that China would never again suffer from another Sars-like epidemic. \n Mr Gao is facing a storm of anger for this prediction since the outbreak in December 2019 of new coronavirus Covid-19, which has caused infections and deaths than Sars. \n As of March 7, according to the World Health Organization, Covid-19 has caused 3,073 deaths and infected 80,813 people in China, with hundreds of thousands more under medical observation. \n A medical and humanitarian tragedy has wreaked havoc in Wuhan city and Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic. \n A widely circulated social-media article describes 11 striking mistakes China has repeated this time around. \n The most grievous failings are the government cover-ups and censorship in the early phases of the epidemic which cost the country a precious three weeks in January to fight the virus. \n The most notorious cover-up surrounded Dr Li Wenliang, the now renowned whistle-blower who drew attention to early cases of Covid-19 infection. \n The police admonished him for warning people about the virus on social media and he later died from the infection himself. \n As news of his death began to circulate online on the evening of Feb 6 Feb, there was an outpouring of mourning and anger — too much for the censors to manage. \n Dr Li is already a martyr in the eyes of his mourners. But will the present crisis tragically embodied by his death spur China to learn any real lessons? \n Leaning from history is one of the most difficult skills for humankind to master. \n German philosopher Hegel once cynically remarked that “the only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history”. \n Twentieth-century American philosopher George Santayana offered a dark warning that “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”. \n The value of historical learning is just as venerated in the Chinese tradition. The great 11th-century classic work of Chinese historiography Comprehensive Mirror to Aid Governance by Zi Zhi Tong Jian trawls the entirety of Chinese history up to that point for lessons in politics and governance. \n Courageous Chinese intellectuals are signing online letters calling for the authorities to respect freedom of speech, supposedly guaranteed by the country’s constitution. \n They believe that if freedom of speech as an individual right were protected, voices like Dr Li’s would have been heard more widely and effectively, perhaps forestalling the spread. If Dr Li’s death led to real freedom of speech in China, that would be a lesson well learned. \n But there is no sign as yet of such learning taking place. No sooner had demands for freedom of expression gained traction than they too fell victim to censors. \n Information control is hardening, not loosening. Truthful depictions of the tolls of the crisis in Wuhan are condemned as rumours and swiftly deleted. \n This happened to Fang Fang, a resident of Wuhan and professional writer whose first-hand blogs of the humanitarian disaster unfolding in her city have gripped millions of readers. \n The length to which the censors have gone to eliminate dissent is extraordinary. On Feb 22, authorities killed an article run by the official Xinhua News Agency for its assertion that “the sky is not going to fall upon the telling of truth”. \n A more promising avenue for learning is governance reform. This is where most Chinese discussions on managing the epidemic are centred. \n Various experts are weighing in on the need for institutional reform. Unlike Western commentaries which tend to blame the authoritarian system of President Xi Jinping, Chinese scholars raise a multitude of questions beyond politics. \n These include concerns about state–society relations, centre–local relations and the role of social organisations (including non-governmental organisations) and professional groups. \n While the rigidity of the Chinese system and the consequent governance failure are part of their criticisms, their comments are more nuanced and fine-tuned. \n Some of these views may reach the very top of the Chinese system, but it is unclear how the leadership will learn from this crisis. \n There are likely to be plenty of technical fixes, such as those recently announced by President Xi. \n But will the learning be so deep as to inaugurate systemic governance reforms and ensure long-term progress? \n As China continues its fight against Covid-19, the best hope is that the country can learn real lessons from this crisis and prove Hegel wrong.

Los efectos del coronavirus han infectado las Bolsas europeas, que han despertado este lunes con caídas por el temor al avance del 2019-nCoV, o virus de Wuhan —como también se ha bautizado en referencia a la ciudad china donde el microorganismo saltó por primera vez de un animal a un ser humano—. Este lunes el miedo al avance de la enfermedad, que ya ha infectado a más de 2.700 personas y ha matado a 80, ha saltado plenamente a los mercados financieros: el selectivo español, Ibex 35, cerraba la jornada con una caída del 2%, unas décimas por debajo de sus pares europeos. El CAC40 de París, el Dax alemán y el FTSE londinense sufrían caídas de más del 2,2%. Las Bolsas chinas esquivaban el impacto al permanecer cerradas por la festividad del año nuevo lunar, pero el Nikkei japonés se ha dejado también del 2%.\nUno de los sectores que directamente se ha visto más afectado ha sido el turístico. El grupo de aerolíneas IAG (que engloba a British Airways, Iberia, Vueling y Air Lingus, entre otras) registraba pérdidas este lunes del 5%, mientras que la agencia de viajes online eDreams superaba el 7%. El sector hotelero no se libraba del pánico de los inversores: Meliá Hoteles caía en torno al 5% y Amadeus, proveedor de soluciones tecnológicas para empresas turísticas, perdía más del 6%. El color rojo se repetía en otras empresas europeas del sector: Easyjet y AirFrance sufrían pérdidas similares a las de IAG. Lufthansa, de más del 4,5%. El miedo al virus provoca una disminución de los movimientos de viajeros con origen o destino China, lo que se traduce en una menor venta de billetes e incluso la potencial cancelación de vuelos.\nEl barril de crudo Brent, el de referencia en Europa, bajó solo ayer casi un 3% y marcó su precio mínimo en tres meses, por debajo de los 59 dólares, frente a los casi 65 a los que se vendía hace una semana. El golpe encajado por el mercado petrolero afecta también a las divisas de algunos países productores, como Rusia o México.\nEl ministro de Energía de Arabia Saudí, el príncipe Abdulaziz bin Salman, ha atribuido el derrumbe a “factores psicológicos” ante los medios de comunicación, y ha recordado que el brote del SARS de 2003 finalmente “no causó una significativa reducción en la demanda de petróleo”. Sin embargo, las presiones bajistas en el mercado de crudo han sido lo suficientemente potentes como para compensar el aumento de la incertidumbre en Oriente Próximo (tras el ataque a la embajada de EE UU en Bagdad), un factor que suele provocar alzas en el Texas y el Brent.\nEl rebote ha afectado también a bancos, metalúrgicas y petroleras, y ha acabado propagando el rojo a todos los valores de la Bolsa española en los primeros compases de la jornada de este lunes. Acerinox y ArcelorMittal, cedían más del 3%. Sabadell, un 1,8% y Bankia, superaba el 1%. La petrolera Repsol cerró la jornada con pérdidas superiores al 3% y Ence, dedicada a la energía y celulosa, rebasó el 5%.\nEl brote del corona virus se ha originado en la ciudad donde están los principales productores chinos de automóviles y acero del país, dos industrias clave en la segunda mayor potencia económica mundial. La ciudad de Wuhan, situada en la provincia de Hubei (centro del gigante asiático), cuenta además con la presencia de más de 300 multinacionales, de ahí que los temores se hayan disparado a medida que se han ido conociendo más datos sobre la infección. Mientras, los inversores se mantienen atentos la reunión de este miércoles de la Reserva Federal de Estados Unidos y de la reunión del Banco de Inglaterra del jueves —un día antes de la salida del país británico de la UE— se ha disparado la compra de tradicionales activos refugio como el oro o el yen. \nNo obstante, son muchos países los que ya han empezado a tomar medidas directas para frenar la expansión del coronavirus. Las operadoras de viajes rusas dejaban esta mañana de vender vuelos a China, ha asegurado este lunes Dimitry Gorin, el vicepresidente de la Asociación de Turoperadores Rusos, acorde a las recomendaciones del regulador del país. Solo se mantenía, de momento, la venta de billetes de vuelta.\nOtros países han tomado medidas incluso más radicales: Mongolia anunció el domingo el cierre de todos sus cruces fronterizos con China, mientras que el país originario del brote ha empezado a imponer el estado de cuarentena en las principales ciudades afectadas, afectando a más de 50 millones de personas. Mientras tanto, el Comité de Seguridad Sanitaria de la Unión Europea se ha reunido este lunes para decidir el marco de actuación, después de que se hayan diagnosticado tres casos en Francia. La comisaria de Salud de la Unión Europea, Stella Kyriakides, aseguraba antes de la reunión que estaban “listos para actuar y intensificar nuestra respuesta si es necesario”.\n“Es demasiado pronto para cuantificar el impacto económico del coronavirus, pero a la hora de afrontar shocks inesperados como este, la aproximación más razonable parece la de evaluar los precedentes”, explicaba en un comunicado el analista económico de AXA Investment, Gilles Moëc, que recordaba el episodio del SARS en 2003, un virus de la misma familia que también se originó en el gigante asiático. “En este sentido, la crisis ocasionada por el SARS rebajó el PIB de China un 1,1% y un 2,5% el de Hong Kong, mientras que solo supuso un impacto del 0,1% en el PIB de EE UU”, apunta el economista de AXA. Los cálculos preliminares de Standars & Poor's coinciden con esta: la calificadora sugiere que una caída del 10% en los sectores afectados mermaría en un 1,2% el crecimiento del PIB del país asiático.\nSin embargo, el analista de AXA Investment recuerda que desde entonces el peso de China en la economía mundial ha crecido significativamente, así que el contagio en la economía mundial probablemente debería ser mayor. Si bien conviene insistir que en este momento todavía es demasiado pronto para saber si el SARS y sus efectos económicos constituyen el precedente correcto para evaluar el coronavirus”. Moëc enfatizaba que “los contactos entre China y el resto del mundo se han disparado en los últimos 15 años y la aparición de focos de contagio a larga escala más allá de la región de Gran China obviamente cambiaría la ecuación”.\n"}, {"content": "Coronavírus.

SINGAPORE — A Singaporean who was hospitalised in Hubei province after being infected with the Covid-19 virus has been discharged, said Minister of Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan in Parliament on Monday (March 2). \n “To date, we're aware of one Singaporean who was infected with the virus and hospitalised in Hubei province,” Dr Balakrishnan told fellow Members of Parliament (MP).  \n “Our embassy in Beijing has been in touch with him to offer assistance, and I’m very pleased to inform the House he has been discharged from hospital in China.” \n Dr Balakrishnan also gave an update on the status of the Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan city, the epicentre of China’s Covid-19 outbreak. \n On Jan 30 and Feb 9 this year, the Singapore Government deployed two evacuation flights to repatriate 266 Singaporeans and their family members from Wuhan back to Singapore. \n Among these Singaporeans, seven of them tested positive for the novel coronavirus.  \n “I'm glad to report that all have since been discharged from hospital,” said Dr Balakrishnan. \n He also spoke of the importance of Singaporeans electronically registering themselves with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) when they head overseas.  \n He said that many of the evacuees from Wuhan were electronically registered with the MFA, which made it easier to contact them and arrange for their flights home. \n “Given the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak in China and... many other countries, we urge Singaporeans to e-register with us,” said Dr Balakrishnan. “It enables us to stay in touch with them (in times of emergencies)... as well as for them to stay in touch with us.” \n During his speech, he also commended the MFA’s consular officers for “working extra hard in this critical period to look out for overseas Singaporeans”.   \n Mr Lim Biow Chuan, MP for Mountbatten, then asked whether the MFA has reached out to Singaporeans who are still in China to find out why they are not coming back. \n In response, Dr Balakrishnan said there are many reasons some Singaporeans have chosen to remain in China. \n Earlier, he told Parliament that there are currently more than 1,900 Singaporeans in mainland China who are electronically registered with the MFA. He said he believes the number is “actually much higher”. \n However, he told Mr Lim that the MFA was given a variety of reasons for why they chose not to return. \n Some of them said that their livelihoods depend on them remaining in China. Others have families there and feel an obligation to look after their extended families. \n “There were others — perhaps not so much now, but in the earlier phase of the crisis — who were worried even about travelling, making the journey to Wuhan and therefore decided that they would stay in place.” \n Said Dr Balakrishan: “The key point is this: We will remain in touch, we will do our best to help and it would also help if they e-register with us because that gives us an immediate direct line to them, and similarly for them to us.”   \n "}, {"content": "Olympic boxing qualifiers in Wuhan NIXED!. \nQualifying boxing matches for Asia and Oceania for the 2020 Olympic Games that were set to take place in China's Wuhan next month have been cancelled due to fears over the new flu-like coronavirus, Japan's Kyodo news agency said on Wednesday.\nBoxing preparations for the Games have already been upended after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in June took over the competition and suspended the international boxing federation due to issues with its finances and governance.\nThe IOC have instead set up a task force, led by its member and International Gymnastics Federation head Morinari Watanabe, to organise the boxing events.\nThe Kyodo report cited organisers as the source of the news.

El coronavirus de Wuhan no solo ha dejado aislados a los 46 millones de personas que habitan en las ciudades bloqueadas de la provincia china de Hubei, el foco de la epidemia. Después de que la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) declarara el jueves una emergencia sanitaria internacional, es toda China la que se encuentra cada vez más desconectada del resto del mundo. Numerosas aerolíneas se han precipitado a cancelar sus rutas chinas. Distintos países han anunciado el cierre de sus fronteras para quienes hayan estado en ese país en los últimos 14 días, incluidos los nacionales de terceros países.\nDentro de China, la situación que ha creado el 2019-nCoV no remite. El número de infectados ronda los 14.380; las víctimas mortales llegan a 304; las personas bajo observación, 163.000, de los que de 19.544 se sospecha que se hayan contagiado. La noticia positiva: el número de pacientes curados, 328, supera al de fallecidos. La madrugada de este domingo, el Departamento de Salud de Filipinas anunció la muerte de un hombre de nacionalidad china de 44 años a causa del coronavirus.\nEl brote ya ha llegado a 24 países, que acumulan más de 150 casos, entre ellos uno en España. Solo África y América del Sur se encuentran aún libres del virus.\nUna situación que, según Estados Unidos, justifica una declaración de “emergencia de salud pública” en su territorio. Este país —el primero que anunció la repatriación de sus ciudadanos en Wuhan tras el abrupto cierre de esa ciudad el día 23— cerrará sus fronteras a cualquier extranjero que no tenga lazos familiares con ciudadanos o residentes permanentes de EE UU y que haya estado en China en las dos semanas previas a su llegada, el periodo máximo de incubación. El veto entrará en vigor este mismo domingo. Además, las líneas aéreas estadounidenses también han anunciado la suspensión temporal de sus vuelos a China.\nOtros países han hecho lo mismo. Este sábado se multiplicaban los anuncios de retirada de vuelos. A las ya conocidas de British Airways, Iberia o Lufthansa se sumaban la australiana Qantas, las aerolíneas vietnamitas o las compañías de bandera de Uzbekistán, Turkmenistán o Irán.\nLos viajeros que hayan pasado por China en las últimas dos semanas tampoco serán admitidos en naciones como Australia, El Salvador, Mongolia, Italia o Singapur.\nLas medidas han causado un profundo malestar en el Gobierno chino, que trata de atajar la epidemia lo antes posible y sin reparar en costes. Pekín quiere dejar claro que errores como el de la gestión del SARS —la epidemia similar a la actual que mató a casi 800 personas en todo el mundo en 2003— no se van a repetir.\n\"No es necesario que cunda el pánico inútilmente, ni tomar medidas excesivas\", ha declarado el embajador chino en Ginebra, Xu Chen, en una rueda de prensa. La OMS, ha subrayado el diplomático, no deja de recalcar que tiene “plena confianza” en la capacidad de la segunda economía del mundo para resolver la crisis. Esta organización de la ONU no considera necesario restringir los viajes ni el comercio con el país asiático.\nPara este país, el cierre de fronteras o la salida en tropel de los extranjeros de Wuhan representa  un voto de no confianza en sus medidas de control y de su sistema sanitario, pese a la saturación y falta de material protector que el mismo Gobierno ha admitido. En muchos casos, los obstáculos burocráticos han retrasado horas o días enteros los vuelos de repatriación de extranjeros.\nPese a ello, un segundo avión fletado por Francia aterrizó este domingo en la base aérea de Istres, en el sur del país, con 250 extranjeros de 30 nacionalidades diferentes repatriados desde Wuhan, dos días después de la llegada de los primeros 180 ciudadanos franceses desde la ciudad identificada como la zona cero del coronavirus. Ninguno de los nuevos pasajeros, 65 franceses y “muchos europeos”, según dijo el ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, Jean-Yves Le Drian, presentaban síntomas a la hora de abordar el vuelo. Tampoco los primeros ciudadanos repatriados han desarrollado hasta el momento la enfermedad, agregó el secretario de Estado Adrien Taquet. Mientras que los extranjeros tenían previsto ser enviados a sus países de origen —entre otros Bélgica, Suecia y Noruega— según un protocolo no revelado, los 65 franceses serán distribuidos entre el centro de vacaciones a 30 kilómetros de Marsella donde se encuentran los primeros repatriados y una escuela de bomberos próxima a Aix-en-Provence totalmente aislada y acomodada para su llegada, según las autoridades.\nHasta cierto punto, no cabe duda de que existe un componente político, y no solo sanitario, en algunas de las decisiones de cerrar fronteras o mantenerlas abiertas. Pese a las numerosas recomendaciones de especialistas médicos, y de haber confirmado ya 13 casos en su territorio, el Gobierno de Hong Kong se ha negado hasta ahora a cerrar por completo la frontera. Sí ha suspendido las conexiones por transbordador o tren de alta velocidad y reducido el número de vuelos hacia la China continental. Los sindicatos del personal médico amenazan con declararse en huelga este lunes si la jefa del Gobierno, Carrie Lam, no declara un cierre completo.\nOtros países con una gran dependencia económica de China se han colocado decididamente al lado de esta potencia. Pakistán se resiste a evacuar a sus universitarios en Wuhan, pese a los llamamientos de los estudiantes, para mostrar “solidaridad” al Gobierno en Pekín. Un argumento similar utiliza el primer ministro de Camboya, Hun Sen. En una rueda de prensa en Phnom Penh el jueves insistía en que sus nacionales en China, incluida Wuhan, “tienen que permanecer allí para ayudar al pueblo chino a combatir esta enfermedad. No hay que huir del pueblo chino en estos momentos difíciles”.\nPero las medidas de Estados Unidos, en concreto, amenazan con abrir un frente más en las difíciles relaciones entre las dos grandes potencias, que habían firmado en diciembre una tregua en su guerra comercial que duraba ya casi dos años. Antes del anuncio del cierre de fronteras, esta semana el secretario de Comercio, Wilbur Ross, aseguraba que el coronavirus en China beneficiaba a EE UU en tanto que obligaría a las empresas a sacar sus cadenas de suministro del país asiático.\n“Las palabras y los actos de algunos responsables estadounidenses ni se basan en hechos ni son adecuados”, ha declarado la portavoz del Ministerio de Exteriores chino, Hua Chunying, en un comunicado. “Justo en cuanto la OMS se pronunció contra restricciones de viaje, Estados Unidos se apresuró a tomar el camino opuesto.

WUHAN/BEIJING (CAIXIN GLOBAL) - The Chinese doctor who was punished by police for trying to warn the world of the emergence of the new strain of coronavirus died on Friday (Feb 7) from the disease. He was 34. \n Dr Li Wenliang, one of the whistle-blowers on China's coronavirus, officially known as 2019-nCoV, died at 2.58am on Friday in the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic, the hospital said early on Friday. \n The end came following extraordinary efforts to keep the critically ill doctor alive in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). \n Caixin learnt that treatments included a procedure known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Ecmo), which circulates blood through an artificial lung back into the bloodstream, starting at around 9pm on Thursday. \n News of Dr Li's death broke at around 10pm on Thursday. But the Central Hospital later said on its official Weibo account that a medical rescue effort was still under way. \n Around midnight, a nurse at the hospital told Caixin outside the ICU that Dr Li \"won't make it\". \n Dr Li disclosed on his social media account last Saturday that he had been diagnosed with a 2019-nCoV infection, most likely as a result of treating patients, but said he planned to return to work after recovery. By Wednesday, his condition had worsened, he told Caixin over WeChat. \n \"I haven't felt as good the last couple of days,\" he said. \"It's getting harder to breathe.\" \n An ophthalmologist in Wuhan, Dr Li received national attention after China's top court on Jan 28 criticised Wuhan police for reprimanding eight Wuhan citizens for \"spreading rumours\" about an illness in late December, in a commentary on its official WeChat account. \n Dr Li is considered to be one of the eight, although the police did not identify who specifically they had accused or punished. \n On Dec 30, Dr Li sent a message to his medical school alumni WeChat group, warning that the ophthalmology department in his hospital had put seven patients from a local seafood market into isolation wards after they were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). \n A screenshot of the message was leaked, and Dr Li was summoned by the hospital's inspection unit for a talk. Later, on Jan 3, he was called in and reprimanded by local police for allegedly spreading rumours online and disrupting social order. \n The commentary posted on the social media account of China's Supreme People's Court said that in retrospect, the eight Wuhan citizens should not have been punished, as what they said was not entirely false. \n \"It might have been a fortunate thing if the public had believed the 'rumours' then and started to wear masks and carry out sanitisation measures, and avoid the wild animal market,\" the commentary said. \n Dr Li told Caixin in an interview on Jan 30 that he had been worried the hospital would punish him for \"spreading rumours\" but felt relieved after the top court publicly criticised the police. \n \"I think there should be more than one voice in a healthy society, and I don't approve of using public power for excessive interference,\" Dr Li said. \n A few days after the police summons, Dr Li treated a patient who initially came in for glaucoma but later had a fever. A lung scan showed viral pneumonia. \n On Jan 12, as he felt unwell and was suspected of having contracted the virus, he was moved to an isolation ward, Dr Li told Caixin. His parents were also infected and sent to the hospital. \n On Jan 30, Dr Li said his test result had come back negative, but he remained in the isolation ward. \n He said he did not plan to go through official judicial channels to get an explanation, saying that it would be troublesome for him and the public security bureau. \n \"It's more important that people know the truth,\" Dr Li said. \"Justice is less important to me.\" \n He did take the opportunity, however, to clarify that rumours saying his medical licence was suspended were not true. \n As of Friday morning, China confirmed more than 31,000 coronavirus cases, and the epidemic's death toll had risen past 600. \n This story was originally published by Caixin Global. \n "}, {"content": "Lufthansa vai parar 150 aviões devido a queda no tráfego aéreo.

In particular, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam’s refusal to seal the border with mainland China, seen by many as a move to appease Beijing, has infuriated many.\nLam has said a full closure of the border would be impractical, inappropriate and discriminatory and that the government’s response to the crisis was based on scientific advice and had no political considerations.\nThere have been sporadic weekend protests drawing hundreds since Hong Kong reported its first patient last month, demanding full closure of the border and opposing some buildings being turned into quarantine centers.

Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at what drove Singaporeans across the island to wipe supermarket shelves clean of daily essentials earlier this month, and what it says about the population’s resilience in times of crisis. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here. \n SINGAPORE — While Singaporeans have earned a reputation for being kiasu (Hokkien for the fear of missing out), the scene that played out on Feb 7 at supermarkets across the island was something no one has witnessed here before — not even during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003 or the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. \n Hours before, the Ministry of Health (MOH) raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) alert level from Yellow to Orange. \n The risk-alert level was raised after several novel coronavirus cases were detected in the Republic without any links to previous cases or travel histories to China. \n To allay public anxiety, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made a speech a day after the panic buying, assuring Singaporeans that there was no need to panic as the city was not being locked down, and there was ample supply of food for everyone.  \n Now that a sense of normalcy has returned, questions remain to be answered: What caused all that panic-buying over that fateful weekend, which had left some quarters fuming — and embarrassed — over the behaviour of “ugly Singaporeans”, and others to question whatever happened to decades of efforts aimed at building a resilient society? \n And what does it say about Singaporeans, many of whom have stoically and quietly got on with their lives, despite the uncertainty and disruptions to daily life?  \n Customers picking out instant noodles and other non-perishables at Giant Supermarket in Beauty World Centre on Feb 7, after the Dorscon alert level was changed to Orange. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n THE SITUATION ELSEWHERE \n So far, apart from Singapore, there have been no reports of panic buying in places outside of China.  Residents in Thailand for example, which has 33 confirmed cases as of Friday, told TODAY that the situation was calm and there has been no run on daily essentials. \n Some experts believe that events in Hong Kong, which was gripped by scenes of panic buying recently, had influenced Singaporeans’ behaviour.  \n Speaking to TODAY, Mr Wong Bai Chun, a Hong Kong citizen, said that two weeks ago, there was a brief but acute shortage of toilet paper and other paper goods in the territory, which was sparked by an Internet rumour that the Chinese spring holiday was being extended and there would be insufficient supplies of such products. \n OTHER TRIGGERS \n Negativity bias \n A spokesperson for the Singapore Psychological Society (SPS) council said this is a phenomena where our brains tend to focus more on negative information than positive ones. \n “Our brains are hardwired to register negative stimuli more readily and also to dwell and worry on them for a longer period of time,” the spokesperson told TODAY. \n Self-preservation and groupthink \n Whenever there is a life-threatening epidemic or emergency, the notions of safety, protection, and self-preservation usually come into play. \n “Research suggests that when people are in panic, the thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system and we start to act illogically,” said the spokesperson. “Our ability to decide on our own is minimised.” \n The spokesperson added that people tend to follow others in the hope that the latter could get them out of a dangerous situation. \n In Singapore’s case, this could be a possible reason why people started to hoard or buy things impulsively if everyone else around them was doing the same, or if they were told to do so on social media platforms. \n Social-media \n Mr Lars Voedisch, the managing director of public relations firm PRecious Communications, said the panic-buying is triggered by one or two initial incidents which then get amplified by social media. \n “(This leads) to a snowball effect of more and more people thinking of it, then hearing from the first people acting on their fear, sharing about it and through that fuelling the whole panic,” he said. \n Singapore Management University sociologist Paulin Straughan said it did not help that the public was seeing these images circulated on social media late in the night. As a result, these became the abiding images for many Singaporeans overnight.  \n “For the next 12 hours, the shelves remain empty (in their minds),” she said. “And that’s 12 hours of festering, and it entrenches (the fear that there are no supplies).” \n Agreeing with Mr Voedisch, she reiterated that while technology has helped to disseminate information a lot faster, it has similarly allowed misinformation to spread just as quickly as well. \n This was not something that Singaporeans had to worry about during the past virus outbreaks, she added. \n Empty shelves at Fairprice Finest in Bukit Timah Plaza on Feb 7, after the Dorscon alert level was changed to Orange. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n PUBLIC COMMS ‘COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER’  \n Communications experts told TODAY that the panic-buying in Singapore might have been avoided if the information disseminated by the authorities had been clearer.   \n “The problem with the message was that it was too bureaucratic at the start,” said Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Assistant Professor Liew Kai Khiun.  \n “Much of the Government’s message involved military terms (and) colour codes,” said Asst Prof Liew, who teaches at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI). \n Prof Straughan agreed, noting that the definition of Dorscon Orange was not explained enough as well. \n Dorscon is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation.  \n Orange refers to a situation in which a virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. Previously, the risk assessment level was at Yellow, signifying that the virus was severe and could infect from person to person, but was chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The highest level, Red, indicates that the virus is spreading widely and can result in major disruption such as closing schools. \n “Some people didn’t know what it meant. All they saw was the visual,” said Prof Straughan. “There are four levels. Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. Red is bad, everybody knows that right? Green is good. Now Orange. It is closer to Red than it is to Green. So visually, it lights up all your flags.”  \n Asst Prof Liew pointed out while the message from the authorities was accurate, it did not cater to the layman. To that end, they could have used dialect or Singlish to reach out more effectively, he noted.  \n During the Sars outbreak in 2003, local sitcom character Phua Chu Kang was used to educate Singaporeans on the importance of washing their hands.  This, he said, was an effective way of reaching out to the public, and many people still remember it today. \n A leaked MOH press release a few hours before the official Dorscon Orange announcement, which left many befuddled, might have also fuelled the public panic.  \n The press release was circulated on social media and through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp. \n Up till this incident, Prof Straughan felt that the Government had been doing well in being upfront with Singaporeans about the virus situation. But when the press release was prematurely leaked out, it created some confusion.  \n She said it did not help that recipients of the leaked document were initially told by others that it was fake news, only to be informed by the authorities a few hours later that it was indeed true.   \n Such contradictory information would have led some to question if the authorities were trying to hide something, she said.  \n The authorities have yet to announce the source of the leak, but Mr Chan said on Feb 9 that the various agencies involved in tackling the virus will remind their staff that they have a professional responsibility not to prematurely share information that has not been finalised. \n Despite these short-comings in public communications, some of the experts felt that Mr Lee’s nine-minute long speech on Feb 8 went some way in restoring some sense of normalcy.   \n The SPS council spokesperson said Mr Lee’s message gave people very concrete actions that “handed back a measure of control to people whose sense of control felt threatened”. \n Mr Voedisch said having the Prime Minister step in to address the public helped, because it went beyond technocratic statements and directly addressed what people were concerned with. \n “While authorities should not get emotional when communicating, they have to be empathetic appealing to the hearts and minds of the audience,” said Mr Voedisch. \n However, he was uncertain if an address by Mr Lee to the public at an earlier juncture would have helped.  \n Instead, he said that the authorities should have foreseen the responses from the public as part of proper scenario planning with “ready-to-go action plans”. \n Also, they should have anticipated and addressed the public’s concerns and fears across the different platforms, he added.  \n  \n Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a recorded message which was televised a day after Singapore raised its Dorscon alert level to Orange. Photo: MCI \n ​HERE COMES THE GOOD \n Still, despite the panic buying grabbing the headlines, Mr Chan and other government leaders took pains to point out that a large majority of Singaporeans had been “calm and rational”.  \n Many Singaporeans had come forward to thank the cashiers and supermarket staff constantly working behind the scenes to restock the empty shelves, Mr Chan noted.   \n Countless others have also stepped in to do their part for their fellow citizens, with numerous ground-up initiatives started in the community. \n For example, TODAY had reported about two primary school girls who used their pocket money to buy and deliver breakfast to doctors and nurses. On Valentine’s Day which fell on Friday, community group StandUpForSG also gave out “love letters” to frontline healthcare workers. \n QUIET RESILIENCE  \n Away from the public spotlight and media glare, ordinary Singaporeans have got on with their lives, despite the disruptions and worries brought on by the Covid-19 outbreak.  \n Scores of Singaporeans — such as taxi and private-hire drivers, as well as those in the retail and tourism industries — have seen their livelihoods taken a hit. Others have had to adjust to working from home as business continuity plans swung into place. \n Cleaners, for example, are putting in longer hours while healthcare workers not only have to work longer each day but are also putting themselves at risk on the frontlines.     \n A 23-year-old outbreak nurse who works with Covid-19 patients said that while her family understands the risks of her occupation, it does not stop them from worrying.  \n “Most nurses are worried too, but it’s our job and this is what we do for a living,” said the nurse, who wanted to be known only as Sharmaine due to the sensitivity of her role. \n When she was first assigned to handle suspected Covid-19 cases, Sharmaine said she was scared as no one knew what exactly they were dealing with.  \n “But over time, I grew immune to it, even if a patient were to test positive for the virus. Now I don't feel so scared anymore.” \n However, she feels disappointed at the discrimination against healthcare workers shown by some Singaporeans, even as many others expressed gratitude for their work. \n “It truly is demoralising when you hear of such incidents. We feel ostracised at times because all we want to do is perform our job and go home,” she said. “But we continue to keep an open mind because we are the first line of defence.” \n Some businesses have had to adjust their operating models due to the outbreak. \n Ms Jazz Chong, the owner and director of contemporary gallery Ode To Art, has noticed fewer people visiting the gallery as well as the Raffles City Shopping Centre, where the gallery is located.   \n “With the virus outbreak becoming more severe, we have now decided to take the extra measure of bringing the art to our clients directly,” she said. “If they like the work then it can remain in their home, making it extra convenient for them as they do not even have to leave their house.” \n Business owners like Ms Chong are hoping that people would continue life as normal, albeit taking the necessary precautions.  \n Or as NTU’s Asst Prof Liew put it: “We must have a courageous sense of normality and go on living life normally.”  \n Indeed, Prime Minister Lee noted on Friday that the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to last longer than Sars, with a greater impact already hitting the economy. \n But he stressed: “We have to keep Singapore going and we have to keep making a living. Life has to go on.”     \n    \n   \n "}, {"content": "WRAPUP 9-Americans disembark from virus-hit cruise; China says new cases slow. SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - American passengers were taken off a cruise liner on Sunday to fly home after being quarantined for two weeks off Japan, while China said the rate of new coronavirus cases had slowed, calling that proof its steps to fight the outbreak were working.\nAn announcement aboard the Diamond Princess, where 3,700 passengers and crew have been held since Feb. 3, told Americans to get ready to disembark on Sunday evening for charter flights home. Passengers wearing masks could later be seen waving through the windows of buses parked near the ship.\nOf the roughly 400 Americans on the cruise, more than 40 are infected with the virus and will stay in Japan for treatment, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n“They are not going to go anywhere. They’re going to be in hospitals in Japan,” Fauci told the CBS News program “Face the Nation.” “People who have symptoms will not be able to get on the evacuation plane. Others are going to be evacuated starting imminently to air force bases in the United States.”\nKyodo News Agency said the flights carrying U.S. passengers left Haneda Airport at around 1700 ET (2200 GMT).\nCanadian, Italian, South Korean and Hong Kong passengers were expected to follow soon, after their governments also announced plans to repatriate passengers.\n“Leaving in a few hours. No details. Might be going to Texas or Nebraska,” U.S. passenger Gay Courter told Reuters.\nSeventy new coronavirus cases were confirmed on board, bringing the total on the ship to 355, by far the largest cluster of cases outside China. Fauci told the Washington Post there were 44 infected Americans.\nWithin China, authorities reported 2,009 new cases on Sunday, noting that this was down from more than 2,600 the previous day. They said this showed their efforts to halt the spread of the virus were bearing fruit.\n“The effect of the coronavirus controls is appearing,” Mi Feng, spokesman for the Health Commission, told reporters.\nThe new cases brought the total to 68,500 in mainland China, with 1,665 deaths, including 143 fatalities reported on Sunday. Outside China, more than 500 cases have been confirmed, mostly of people who traveled from Chinese cities, with five deaths.\nThe coronavirus is thought to have emerged at a wildlife market in China’s central province of Hubei. China’s response has included putting Hubei and its capital Wuhan - a city of 11 million people - on virtual lockdown.\nMi said the proportion of confirmed cases who were critically ill had fallen to 21.6% on Saturday, from 32.4% on Jan. 27. He said this showed the authorities were able to treat patients more quickly, preventing cases from becoming critical.\nMark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Britain’s University of Edinburgh, said if the numbers suggested the epidemic has peaked in Hubei, “then this would be encouraging news for the rest of the world too”.\nBut he added: “We should be cautious though; it could simply be that reporting is not keeping up with events in circumstances where the health services are under enormous pressure.”\nDeclining numbers of reported new infections could mean the virus was being contained, but could also mean it was simply running out of susceptible new hosts in Wuhan, he said.\nRestrictions were tightened further in Hubei on Sunday with vehicles, apart from essential services, banned from the roads and companies told to stay shut until further notice.\nAfter an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. But in some cities streets are still deserted.\nOn board the Diamond Princess, American passenger Matthew Smith posted a photo on Twitter showing buses parked on the shore to take U.S. nationals to the airport. American officials in hazmat suits and masks had visited his room to check if he would disembark. He said he wanted to stay.\nThe ship, owned by Carnival Corp., has been held in the port of Yokohama and those with the disease have been taken to hospital onshore. No one from the ship has died.\nCountries that have announced plans to fly their citizens home from the ship say they will take them only if they are symptom-free, and quarantine them on arrival.\nThe U.S. Department of Defense is preparing to receive two flights with passengers - one to land at Travis Air Force Base, California and the other at Kelly Field/Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.\nThe evacuees will be subject to a 14-day quarantine.\nAnother cruise ship, Holland America’s MS Westerdam, docked in Cambodia on Thursday after being rejected by ports elsewhere. An 83-year-old American passenger tested positive upon arriving in Malaysia, authorities there said. A second test requested by the cruise operator confirmed the finding.\nTaiwan reported its first fatality on Sunday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A war of words between China and the United States showed no signs of let up on Monday, with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a phone call with a top Chinese diplomat expressing “strong U.S. objections” over what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to shift blame for the spread of the coronavirus.\nTies between the world’s top two economies, already complicated due to issues including trade, intellectual property rights as well as press freedoms, have further been tested by the outbreak of coronavirus, which causes the sometimes fatal, highly contagious respiratory illness COVID-19.\n“Secretary Pompeo conveyed strong U.S. objections to PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,” Morgan Ortagus, State Department spokeswoman said in a statement about Pompeo’s call with Yang Jiechi, director of the Office of Foreign Affairs of the Communist Party of China.\n“The Secretary stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat,” Ortagus said.\nThe United States on Friday summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest against comments by Beijing suggesting the U.S. military might have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan. David Stilwell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, delivered a very “stern representation” to China’s ambassador Cui Tiankai.\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV reported on Monday that in the phone call Yang told Pompeo that attempts to smear China’s efforts to control the coronavirus “will not succeed” and that actions that harmed China’s interests would be retaliated against.\nThe coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, has spread around the world, upended many countries’ daily lives, pummeled financial markets, brought flights to a standstill, shut down schools and forced the postponement of almost all gatherings including sports and arts events.\nGlobally over 174,100 have been infected and nearly 6,700 have died. U.S. death toll reached 71, with more than 4,100 people having tested positive for the disease.\nBeijing was criticized for initially attempting to censor some Chinese doctors who sounded an alarm over the virus. Since January, it has imposed draconian containment measures, effectively locking down Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, home to 60 million people.\nPompeo, who has sharply criticized Beijing on a number of issues from its trade practices to religious freedoms, has complained that the U.S. response had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from Beijing.\nHowever on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised China for its “data sharing” and appeared to brush off any concern, saying he had read one article on the subject, but that he did not think it was representative of his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n"}, {"content": "a third of coronavirus cases may be ‘silent carriers’, classified chinese data suggests. HONG KONG — The number of \"silent carriers\" — people who are infected by the new coronavirus but show delayed or no symptoms — could be as high as one-third of those who test positive, according to classified Chinese government data seen by the South China Morning Post. \n That could further complicate the strategies being used by countries to contain the virus, which has infected more than 280,000 people and killed nearly 13,000 globally. \n More than 43,000 people in China had tested positive for Covid-19 by the end of February but had no immediate symptoms, a condition typically known as asymptomatic, according to the data. They were placed in quarantine and monitored but were not included in the official tally of confirmed cases, which stood at about 80,000 at the time. \n Scientists have been unable to agree on what role asymptomatic transmission plays in spreading the disease. A patient usually develops symptoms in five days, though the incubation period can be as long as three weeks in some rare cases. \n One obstacle is that countries tally their confirmed cases differently. \n The World Health Organisation classifies all people who test positive as confirmed cases regardless of whether they experience any symptoms. South Korea also does this. But the Chinese government changed its classification guidelines on Feb 7, counting only those patients with symptoms as confirmed cases. The United States, Britain and Italy simply do not test people without symptoms, apart from medical workers who have prolonged exposure to the virus. \n The approach taken by China and South Korea of testing anyone who has had close contact with a patient — regardless of whether the person has symptoms — may explain why the two Asian countries seem to have checked the spread of the virus. Hong Kong is extending testing to airport arrivals in the city, even if travellers have no symptoms. Meanwhile in most European countries and the US, where only those with symptoms are tested, the number of infections continues to rapidly rise. \n A growing number of studies are now questioning the WHO's earlier statement that asymptomatic transmission was \"extremely rare\". A report by the WHO's international mission after a trip to China estimated that asymptomatic infections accounted for 1 to 3 per cent of cases, according to a European Union paper. \n \"The number of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) cases worldwide continues to grow, and the gap between reports from China and statistical estimates of incidence based on cases diagnosed outside China indicates that a substantial number of cases are underdiagnosed,\" a group of Japanese experts led by Mr Hiroshi Nishiura, an epidemiologist at Hokkaido University, wrote in a letter to the International Journal of Infectious Diseases in February. \n Based on their research, Mr Nishiura put the proportion of asymptomatic Japanese patients evacuated from Wuhan, ground zero of the outbreak in China, at 30.8 per cent — similar to the classified Chinese government data. \n But official figures from South Korea — which had carried out nearly 300,000 tests on all close contacts of its confirmed cases as of Wednesday — are the most comparable to China's. More than 20 per cent of the asymptomatic cases reported to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention remained without symptoms until they were discharged from hospital. \n \"Korea currently has a significantly higher rate of asymptomatic cases than other countries, perhaps due to our extensive testing,\" Ms Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of South Korea's CDC, told a press briefing on March 16. \n Another useful point of reference is the data collected from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined for weeks in Yokohama, Japan. All of its passengers and crew were tested, with 712 people testing positive — 334 of whom were asymptomatic, according to official Japanese figures. \n An EU report has put the proportion of asymptomatic cases in Italy at 44 per cent, but in most parts of the country people without symptoms are not tested. \n In Hong Kong, 16 of the 138 confirmed cases as of March 14 were asymptomatic or presymptomatic, according to Mr Ho Pak-leung, a professor with the microbiology department of the University of Hong Kong. \n All of these numbers point to a significantly higher ratio of asymptomatic cases than indicated by data publicly released by China so far. There were 889 asymptomatic patients among the 44,672 confirmed cases as of February 11, epidemiologists from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention wrote in a paper published online in JAMA Network Open on February 24. \n The WHO has said the role of asymptomatic transmissions in the spread of the disease was not clear, but carriers without symptoms were unlikely to be a key factor overall. \n However, some scientists are asking whether asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmissions have been underestimated. \n A joint study by experts in China, the US, Britain and Hong Kong estimated that undocumented cases of the pneumonia, mostly with mild or even no symptoms, were the source of infection for 79 per cent of documented ones before Wuhan was locked down on Jan 23. \n \"These undocumented infections often experience mild, limited, or no symptoms and hence go unrecognised, and, depending on their contagiousness and numbers, can expose a far greater portion of the population to the virus than would otherwise occur,\" the specialists from Columbia University, the University of Hong Kong, Imperial College London, Tsinghua University, and the University of California, Davis wrote in the report. \n A separate study by scientists from the University of Texas at Austin estimated that people who had not yet developed symptoms transmitted around 10 per cent of the 450 cases they studied in 93 Chinese cities. Their findings are awaiting publication in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. \n Mr Ho from the University of Hong Kong said some asymptomatic patients had a viral load similar to those with symptoms. \n \"Of course it is hard to say if they may be less infectious if they don't cough. But there are also droplets when you speak,\" he said, referring to how the respiratory virus is transmitted. \n Mr Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiology and biostatistics professor at the University of Hong Kong, said there was \"clear evidence that infected persons could transmit infection before symptoms appear\". \n \"There are many reports of transmission around one to two days before symptom onset,\" he said. \n A better understanding of asymptomatic cases could lead to adjustments in public health policy, experts said. \n \"The asymptomatic ratio ... could be higher among children than in older adults,\" Mr Nishiura wrote in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. \"That would considerably change our scope of the outbreak, and even the optimal interventions can change.\" SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST \n "}, {"content": "Maskendiplomatie. Die Flughafenfeuerwehr schoss Wasserfontänen auf die weiße Boeing 747, die am vergangenen Freitag auf dem Flughafen des belgischen Lüttich landete. Sodann wurden eine halbe Million Atemschutzmasken, ungezählte Ballen Schutzkleidung und Testkits für das Coronavirus entladen, die auf mehrere europäische Länder verteilt wurden. In den darauffolgenden Tagen kamen weitere Maschinen mit dringend benötigten Hilfsgütern. Eine Spende der Alibaba-Stiftung sowie der Jack-Ma-Stiftung.\nAm Mittwoch dann landeten 300 chinesische Ärzte in Italien, dem zurzeit am schlimmsten von der Covid-19-Pandemie betroffenen Land. An Bord befand sich auch Sun Shuopeng, der Vizepräsident des chinesischen Roten Kreuzes. Am darauffolgenden Donnerstag sagte er Medienberichten zufolge auf einer Pressekonferenz: \"Hier in Mailand, dem am meisten von Covid-19 betroffenen Gebiet, sind die Lockdown-Maßnahmen sehr lax. Ich sehe, dass der Öffentliche Personennahverkehr immer noch in Betrieb ist, die Leute gehen umher, treffen sich in Hotels und tragen keine Masken. Ich weiß nicht, was die Leute hier sich denken.\"\nSolche Kritik ist freilich keine typische Botschaft aus China in diesen Tagen. Meistenteils sind salbungsvolle Worte zu hören. Chinas KP-Chef und Staatspräsident Xi Jingping munterte beispielsweise den spanischen Premier Pedro Sanchez mit der hoffnungsvollen Bemerkung auf, \"nach dem Sturm kommt Sonnenschein\". Nicht ohne hinzuzufügen, nach der Pandemie sollte man über intensivere Zusammenarbeit nachdenken.\nIn einem Telefongespräch mit Italiens Premierminister Giuseppe Conte sprach Xi von einer \"Seidenstraße der Gesundheit\" als Bestandteil von Chinas \"One Belt, One Road\"-Initiative. Ein deutlicher Hinweis darauf, dass die Hilfe für notleidende Europäer auch einen geopolitischen Aspekt hat (wodurch sie natürlich nicht weniger wertvoll wird). Die chinesische Seidenstraßen-Initiative wird in Europa überwiegend kritisch betrachtet, als Expansionismus und als Methode, die teilnehmenden Länder in die Schuldenabhängigkeit von China zu treiben. Das Bild soll sich nun aufhellen und vergessen machen, dass die Corona-Krise mit Chinas Untätigkeit und Verschleierungstaktik begonnen hatte.\nDass China gegenwärtig die Massenproduktion von Schutzmasken in ungeahnte Höhen treibt, um das Material weltweit zur Verfügung zu stellen, spiegelt sich prominent in der Propaganda wider. \"Trump kann ohne chinesische Fabriken sein Maskenversprechen nicht halten\", tönen die Websites des Regimes. Es wird sogar gestreut, dass das Virus aus den USA komme – eine verblüffend plumpe Antwort auf die Versuche des amerikanischen Präsidenten, mit Formulierungen wie \"chinesisches Virus\" die Gesundheitskatastrophe für nationalistische Zwecke zu instrumentalisieren.\nAnsonsten aber gibt sich China als freundliche Großmacht voller Humanität. Und das kommt an. Etwa beim alten Verbündeten Serbien, dessen Präsident Aleksandar Vučić mit folgender Aussage zitiert wird: \"Die europäische Solidarität gibt es nicht. Sie ist ein Ammenmärchen. Wir setzen unsere Hoffnung in das einzige Land, das in der Lage ist, uns in dieser schwierigen Situation zu helfen: die Volksrepublik China.\"\nDa trifft er einen empfindlichen Punkt. Hatte Deutschland nicht zunächst den Export von Atemschutzmasken nach Italien verboten, und ist es nicht so, dass wenige Kilometer vom notleidenden Elsass entfernt deutsche Intensivstationen freie Kapazitäten haben? Und was ist aus Amerika geworden, dem Land der Carepakete und Rosinenbomber?\nChina will diese Rolle übernehmen. Wiedererstarkt, mit allen ebenbürtig in der Welt. Das ist der \"chinesische Traum von der großen nationalen Renaissance\", die Losung Xi Jinpings. Seit Jahrtausenden wird in China für Herrschaftsperioden eine solche Losung ausgegeben, die der jeweiligen Ära ihren Namen geben soll. Der Begriff der chinesischen Renaissance hat hundertjährige Tradition, nun aber soll es unter der Führung der KP Chinas so weit sein. Die Corona-Krise schien diesen Kurs zu Anfang schwer zu erschüttern – jetzt aber kehrt Peking die Energie dieser Erschütterung um und will sie für den eigenen Aufstieg nutzen.\n"}, {"content": "US advises citizens against travelling to China.

Para o presidente da Associação Portuguesa das Agências de Viagens e Turismo (APAVT), Pedro Costa Ferreira, em entrevista ao PÚBLICO/Renascença, que pode ouvir completa esta quinta-feira a partir das 13h, no que concerne ao novo coronavírus, ​o importante são os “números” e os “factos”, seguir os conselhos aos viajantes do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros e as indicações da Organização Mundial de Saúde. O resto é “ruído”, diz, lembrando que, tirando a China e parte da Itália, não há limitação às viagens.\nDesde o fim-de-semana passado que há literalmente pânico na Europa, o número de países afectados está a crescer. França, Itália, agora Espanha, fala-se de muitos voos cancelados, muitos clientes que não sabem se devem ou não manter as suas viagens. É alarmismo ou é suficiente para abalar o sector? É um pouco tudo isso. É um pouco de pânico, de desconhecimento dos factos, mas também um pouco do sector a ser abalado. Tenho a sensação de que a primeira coisa que temos de fazer antes de começar a falar do coronavírus é sair da “discoteca”, tem muito ruído. O circo mediático que está montado à volta deste tema tem produzido um enorme ruído e esse ruído tem dificultado de sobremaneira a configuração, o enquadramento, a relativização de todo o problema.\nVamos lá configurar o problema fora do ruído: o que temos à data de hoje e sabendo que os números são muito dinâmicos. Cerca de 80 mil infectados, cerca de 2700 mortos, o que indicia uma taxa de mortalidade francamente baixa, sobretudo se comparada com outros acontecimentos similares que tiveram taxas de mortalidade bem superiores. Temos quase 30 mil pacientes curados ou recuperados da infecção, coisa que o circo mediático nunca aponta. Esta terça-feira estava a olhar para uma televisão que falava de 80 mil infectados, 2700 mortos e mais nada. Há que acrescentar: e 30 mil recuperados. E depois há que relativizar e enquadrar.\nPor ano em Portugal deverão morrer cerca de 3 mil pessoas [de gripe], por ano em Itália – onde contamos, no momento em que estamos a falar, 12 mortos – morrem cerca de 8 mil pessoas de gripe. Quer isto dizer que não temos nenhum problema? Com certeza que não. Temos é que o enquadrar.\nCompreendo que queira serenar, sendo o presidente da APAVT, mas esta terça-feira ouvimos um especialista mundial que voltou da China a dizer que o mundo não está preparado para uma coisa destas. Se o mundo não está preparado de acordo com um especialista, talvez seja bom o sector preparar-se. Mas não estou a dizer que o sector não está preparado. Em primeiro lugar, estou a relativizar e a afastar o circo. Vamos falar de números. Isto não quer dizer que não tenhamos um problema. Mas qual é para já o principal problema? É o desconhecimento do vírus, do seu modo de transmissão, das suas consequências, do seu momento de transmissão, se é sazonal ou ao longo de todo o ano, é a imprevisibilidade. É a imprevisibilidade que provoca este caos e o pânico.\nRelativamente a esta imprevisibilidade acho que há um caminho, ou vários. Acho que há um caminho que é o certo, o da racionalidade, o da prudência, e eu até diria o da humildade. Racionalidade: vamos estudar, vamos acompanhar, vamos verificar os números, como é que se está a transmitir, onde é que isto vai parar. Por exemplo, na China as recuperações estão a acontecer a um ritmo muito mais elevado do que os novos infectados, é uma coisa boa. Mas na Europa estamos a começar um processo de transmissão que, provavelmente, se vai agravar nos próximos dias, o que é uma coisa má.\nTemos de ter alguma humildade relativamente a esta falta de conhecimento. É uma certeza que dentro de dois meses, muito provavelmente, nós não estamos todos enfiados em casa sem viver, mas podemos estar com as nossas vidas relativamente afectadas. É também se calhar uma certeza que não vamos ter uma vida normal, mas podemos ter uma vida muito próxima do normal.\nE se tivermos uma viagem já comprada para a China? Se eu tenho uma viagem para daqui a quinze dias, que comprei numa agência de viagens, a agência está disponível para reembolsar-me da viagem?Não está disponível, está obrigada legalmente e já o faz.\nMas isso para todo o ano ou para curto prazo? Falar de reembolsos tem de ser caso a caso. Mas há alguns casos que podemos determinar. Reservas realizadas antes da eclosão do problema, que vão ser viajadas até final de Março, podem ser reembolsadas, estão enquadradas legalmente. Em Junho, se calhar não podem ser reembolsadas já, temos de aguardar a evolução.\nE quando é que se considera a eclosão do problema?Julgo que é 31 de Dezembro. Uma coisa é certa, uma viagem que foi reservada ontem não tem direito a reembolso hoje. Até porque uma viagem reservada ontem teve de ter da parte do agente de viagens, e é isso que ditam as boas práticas da agência de viagens, toda a informação ao cliente. O cliente vai ciente do que vai encontrar.\nE reservada há oito dias para Itália?Neste momento é cedo para dizer. Se for para o Norte da Itália, incluindo Milão, é muito provável que a resposta seja um reembolso. É provável – mas, uma vez mais, tem de ser caso a caso. Quando foi feita a reserva, qual o objectivo, por que é que a pessoa quer cancelar. Se for só um voo não tem direito a reembolso, tem pelo menos que ter dois serviços comprados numa agência de viagens. Só voo não tem direito a reembolso.\nNunca? Nem para a China?Legalmente, não está enquadrado. O que está enquadrado pela lei das agências de viagens é dois serviços vendidos ao mesmo tempo, o voo mais hotel, o voo mais transfer. O que chamamos de viagens organizadas.\nContinuamos sempre a falar de curto prazo, ou seja, ainda no “esperar para ver”, tanto pela associação, como as próprias agências. As decisões que referiu são um conselho da associação a todas as agências ou cada agência pode decidir de outra forma?É mais do que isso. No caso da China, é um caso de força maior, há um desaconselhamento no portal das comunidades, portanto se a viagem é organizada, e com mais do que um serviço, tem direito a reembolso. E é preciso que se diga que as agências de viagens estão muito preparadas para isso porque têm seguros. Uma viagem a Itália, hoje, para Milão, se foi reservada antes da eclosão do problema e se vai ser viajada até final de Março, essa viagem, se organizada e reservada numa agência de viagens, [está enquadrada]. Se foi reservada fora de uma agência não está enquadrada, não tem qualquer protecção. Os problemas das agências de viagens hoje são também as oportunidades das agências de viagens. É numa agência que o consumidor tem maior protecção.\nEntre a razão e algum alarmismo, que é natural, porque nós olhamos para o nosso mapa interactivo no site do PÚBLICO, em que vemos cada caso a surgir e os casos a aproximarem-se e a rodearem Portugal, as pessoas naturalmente entram em algum alarme. Haverá gente já a cancelar viagens inclusive para a Europa, com receio do coronavírus? Essas pessoas têm direito a cancelar a viagem já? Gostava de aproveitar falar-se em alarme, com ou sem razão, que alguém tem o dever aqui de citar a Organização Mundial de Saúde: a situação actual pede factos, não pede medo; pede ciência, não pede rumores; pede solidariedade, não pede estigma. Nós começamos por ter o estigma dos chineses, provavelmente no final deste processo vamos agradecer-lhes o modo como eles resolveram o problema em casa deles.\nGostava que em Portugal estivesse a acontecer alguma coisa, que o Governo tivesse já a adoptar medidas preventivas, alguma coisa assim?Vamos falar do efeito: a nível macroeconómico, à data de hoje, se falarmos de viagens, acho que o efeito não é significativo para o sector, teve efeito nas viagens para a China, que acabaram, nas viagens da China para cá, que acabaram. Esse é o efeito até à semana passada.\nE qual foi o maior efeito? Os chineses que não vieram? Apesar de tudo, os chineses que não vieram. Apesar de o mercado emissor chinês ser importante, estar em crescimento, tem uma quota inferior a 2,5% no mercado português. E, portanto, teve o efeito que teve, é um período, vamos ver quando é que regressam. E se falarmos no destino China, ainda tem menos efeito. Porque não é um destino muito importante no mercado português e porque este momento não é um momento muito importante de férias dos portugueses. Claro que há problemas.\nSe me pergunta ‘para a China não há reservas?’ – claro que não há reservas neste momento, há cancelamentos, haverá ainda alguns cancelamentos. Para a Itália esperamos reservas esta semana? Com certeza que não há reservas esta semana para a Itália, parece-me lógico. Vai haver cancelamentos? Vai haver muito diálogo, “posso ir?”, “devo ir\"?, \"devo mudar de destino?”, “posso mudar de altura?”, “posso esperar para ver?”, “até que altura é que posso esperar antes de ter ou não pagar alguma coisa sem reembolso?”, há todo esse diálogo, mas todo esse diálogo não inclui com toda a certeza reservas novas. Temos um problema para a Páscoa? Parece-me razoável dizer que sim, que o sector vai ter um problema na Páscoa. As grandes reservas iniciam-se agora durante Março, a Páscoa é em Abril e não se espera um pico de reservas com todo este ambiente, que ainda não chegou ao seu auge.\nE o efeito Páscoa? O efeito Páscoa vai ter um efeito negativo no sector.

Vamos imaginar que a crise se agrava até à Páscoa, isso significa o quê? A Páscoa até para o lazer é um ponto importante. Vamos dizer que ainda não é crítico. Se recuperarmos até ao Verão – e nós tivemos outras epidemias em que dois meses depois as coisas estavam clarificadas –, eu julgo que se nós tivermos um Verão normal, os efeitos sentir-se-ão, mas não serão tão significativos.\nConsegue contabilizar?Não consigo dar um número exacto.

Que direito tenho se a cancelar?”Temos de ter aqui alguma organização, não diria legal, mas pelo menos mental. Nós temos que seguir e seguimos com muito rigor as informações do portal das comunidades, essas são a base da existência ou não de uma possibilidade legal de reembolso, se o portal das comunidades não aconselha a viagem para determinada região ou se aconselha. A grande verdade é que o portal, hoje, por causa do coronavírus, não aconselha para a China e para o Norte de Itália e Milão, algumas zonas do Sul, para pessoas jovens. Fora essas duas regiões, hoje não há uma limitação às viagens.

Nos piores cenários, todo o modelo económico mundial vai ter dificuldades. À partida, e à frente de todos, o turismo, porque é a circulação de pessoas e, portanto, se o turismo terá dificuldades nos piores cenários, também em Portugal teremos de ter uma redução da velocidade. Não estou a dizer que vai acontecer.

BEIJING/GENEVA (Reuters) - New coronavirus cases in the Chinese province at the epicenter of the outbreak fell for a second straight day, but deaths rose after the World Health Organization had cautioned there was not yet enough data to know if the epidemic had slowed.\nHubei reported 1,693 new cases as of Tuesday, down from 1,807 the previous day and the lowest number in the province since Feb. 11. But deaths rose by 132, up from 93 the previous day. The latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to over 74,000 with about 2,000 deaths.\nThe head of a leading hospital in China’s central city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, died of the disease, becoming one of the most prominent victims since the novel virus first appeared at the end of last year.\nIllustrating the impact of the outbreak on worldwide growth and corporate profits, oil prices tumbled and equity markets slid after Apple Inc (AAPL.O) issued a revenue warning due to the disruption the disease is causing to global supply chains.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Chinese data “appears to show a decline in new cases” but any apparent trend “must be interpreted very cautiously.”\nOutside China, there have been 827 cases of the disease, known as COVID-19, and five deaths, according to a Reuters count based on official statements. More than half of those cases have been on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan.\nTedros said there had been 92 cases of human-to-human spread of the coronavirus in 12 countries outside China.\n“We have not seen sustained local transmission of coronavirus except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship,” he said.\nRussia, however, was taking no chances. Starting on Thursday, it will suspend entry of many Chinese citizens.\nBy the end of this week, the WHO said, 40 countries in Africa and 29 in the Americas are due to have the ability to detect COVID-19.\n“Many of these countries have been sending samples to other countries for testing, waiting several days for results. Now they can do it themselves within 24-48 hours,” Tedros said.\nChina says figures indicating a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.\nThe WHO’s Mike Ryan said China had success with “putting out the fire” first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday are monitored.\n“Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one,” Ryan said\nThe numbers appear encouraging, said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Britain’s University of Edinburgh, who described himself as cautious.\nChinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to fall victim. The hospital was designated solely for treating virus-infected patients.\nDespite global concerns about the economic impact of the disease, China’s ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday this would be “limited, short-term and manageable” and that Beijing had enough resources to step in if needed.\nChinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020 despite the epidemic.\nEconomists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon.\n“The employment situation is OK in the first quarter, but if the virus is not contained by end-March, then from the second quarter, we’ll see a big round of layoffs,” said Dan Wang, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Job losses could run as high as 4.5 million, he forecast.\nBritain’s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks because of the coronavirus.\nComponents made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world, and Hubei province is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said the economy there was in an emergency situation and required stimulus as the epidemic had disrupted demand for South Korean goods.\nSingapore announced a $4.5 billion financial package to help contain the outbreak in the city-state and weather its economic impact.\nJapan, where the economy was already shrinking and the epidemic has created fears of recession, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to put limits on public crowds while some companies are telling employees to work from home.\n"}, {"content": "Getting ready for Covid-19. \nA recent Sunday afternoon at the Bangalore International Centre featured dastangoi (storytelling), an avant garde dance performance and an uplifting talk on improving public education.\nThe Thursday of Gautam Menon's talk on Covid-19 in late February is also a busy one that coincides with the opening day of an exhibition of artisanal work inspired by Mahatma Gandhi.\nAs soon as Menon, a professor of biology and physics at Ashoka University and a leading authority on the spread of viruses, has tested the audio-visual system, I ask him if the government's public campaigns on how to avoid becoming infected have been too muted.\n\"You have to balance the fact that you don't want to scare the public,\" he says, before going on to say that the public health messaging on adopting different types of behaviour such as, say, not shaking hands had been inadequate.\nIn the past few days as the numbers of infected in India have escalated, there has been a greater sense of urgency.\n\"The PM cancelling his attendance at Holi functions sends out the right message,\" Menon said in an e-mail.\nOne of the problems for health officials worldwide in slowing the infections is that the symptoms do not show for several days.\nThis makes isolating the infected quickly and tracing people they have been in contact with extremely difficult when compared with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that infected 8,000 people and killed 800 in 2003.\nTemperature tests at airports have proved inadequate, leading to long quarantines that may need to be even longer.\n\"The medical science is still to be established; 14 to 21 day (quarantines) is probably optimal,\" he says.\nGlobally, Covid-19 has been less lethal than SARS or the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but it has been incredibly virulent.\nIn addition to droplets from coughs and sneezes, a less typical mode of transmission could be faecal-oral because the virus has been found in stool samples, which \"would be a problem in a country with poor sanitation like ours\".\n\nTea for attendees is laid on by the BIC, and is a choice of tea and 'instant' True South filter coffee decoction and salty biscuits.\nMenon, who worked at Chennai's Institute of Mathematical Sciences before joining Ashoka, is quickly surrounded by friends from academia.\nAs Menon's lecture begins, he seems an academic who, like the dastangoi artistes, dispenses wisdom through storytelling.\nMenon then details how the first victim from Korea travelled across the Middle East before returning home and infecting his wife, people who had visited him in the hospital and other visitors to the hospital.\nA rapid history of viruses, before pausing to reflect on the Spanish flu in 1918-1919, which infected 500 million worldwide and killed 17 million in India, follows.\n\"Infectious disease is a given of humankind. There will always be another around the corner.\"\nA poster of the Hollywood film Contagion pops up on a slide.\n\"It's not a bad film,\" he says -- in case we wish to download it that evening.\nThe Covid-19 belongs to the family of coronaviruses that is \"the second leading cause of the common cold\", he says.\nHe then briskly explains why SARS and Covid-19 originated in wet markets in China: The killing of animals and sloshing of water on the floors to clean up the blood allowed a mixing of fluids and made it easier for the virus to \"spillover\" from species such as civet cats, bats and pangolins to human beings.\nMenon enthuses about the \"groovy nature\" of studying viruses because this spans virology, geopolitics and mathematics.\nMenon uses numbers to highlight that the disease is progressing rapidly into a pandemic, but also to reassure the audience that the chances of dying from it is \"minimal\".\nThe fatality rate of 2 per cent to 3 per cent is well below that of MERS, which was as high as 37 per cent, and of SARS at 10 per cent.\nThe Covid-19 death rate also obscures that the elderly suffer much higher fatality rates (15 per cent).\n\"Children tend to be hardly affected,\" he tells me.\n\nDemystifying the epidemic, he debunks the effectiveness of masks when worn by the average person.\n\"The mask has to be worn and taken off in a specific way and one should take care not to touch it. (It provides) more psychological than real protection.\"\nAmerican doctors on Twitter have argued that the stampede to buy masks by people not trained to use them will leave medical personnel on the frontline short of them.\nOn stage, Menon regrets not having a bowl to demonstrate how thoroughly one has to scrub one's hands -- on both sides, fingernails included and all the way up to the elbow.\nIn a country where public toilets are often devoid of soap and people eat with their hands, this seems of mission-critical importance.\nA Canadian public official has likened it to washing one's hands as if one had chopped chillies and was about to put on contact lenses.\n\nHow prepared is India?\nThe first health system to be tested was Kerala's, which, Menon points out, enjoys immense public trust.\nThis is required when administering stay-at-home rules or quarantines such as those seen in China, where 60 million people were in lockdown for a month after the outbreak was made public on January 23.\nPeople accept these extraordinary conditions for the most part, he observes, when such rules are perceived to be \"for the greater good and everyone is seen to suffer equally. One analogy could be demonetisation\".\nWhile Kerala dealt with the Nipah virus effectively and India handled the quarantines of returnees from Wuhan well, \"the number of cases was small\".\nA Wuhan-sized outbreak involving tens of thousands would likely overwhelm India.\nChina has many more doctors and hospital beds relative to its population than India and is a single-party government administered by technocrats.\n\"Even the Chinese system was creaking at the seams,\" he says.\n\nIndia's high levels of pollution leave large numbers battling coughs.\nCoughs in the audience punctuate Menon's talk, and he himself was suffering from one.\nThis is an additional challenge for overloaded hospitals in India.\n\"Respiratory distress as one possible symptom of the coronavirus infection in a country that contains 18 of the 20 world's most polluted cities, isn't particularly useful,\" he wryly points out.\nAfter questions about how long a vaccine might take and whether Covid-19 came from a biological warfare lab, which Menon dismisses, the talk is wrapped up.\nMenon is surrounded by people who want the professor to play doctor.\nIs it safe to fly? (Yes.)\nAre vegetarians immune?\nWould cow urine help?...\n\nMenon is taken for a brisk tour of the centre.\nIn an illustration of the energetic private sector/appalling public infrastructure dichotomy that characterises Bengaluru especially, I am pursued by mosquitoes from the stinky nallah nearby and dust from a giant construction site as my Uber taxi drives away.\nThe philanthropy of Nandan and Rohini Nilekani and corporate managerial smarts has made the BIC a unique place. Bengaluru, however, is characterised by dust pollution that rivals Delhi's as the city's pavements and roads are dug up in a manner that suggests an earthquake has struck.\nThis has created a slow-motion crisis of recurrent coughs, asthma and lung ailments.\nWith the Covid-19 epidemic upon us, years of apathy about pollution may have handicapped India's ability to fight it.\n\n\n"}, {"content": "Growing fears over global spread of virus. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has urged countries around the world to act quickly, as the window of opportunity to curb the wide spread of the disease known as Covid-19 is shrinking. \n Urging nations to invest in preparedness, the United Nations agency's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \"If we do well within the narrowing window of opportunity, we can avert any serious crisis. If we squander the opportunity, then there will be a serious problem on our hands.\" \n The warning follows a spike in the number of infected cases outside of China, with South Korea yesterday reporting that its new infections had more than doubled in a single day to 433, while Iran registered another 10 new cases. \n Japan's cases are also climbing, with 26 new cases reported yesterday to bring the total to 135. \n Meanwhile, mainland China held out hope that it was getting a grip on infections after reporting 397 new confirmed cases on Friday, down from 889 a day earlier. Just 31 new cases were reported outside the epicentre, Hubei province. There were 109 deaths on the same day. \n So far, the number of infections worldwide has climbed to more than 77,000 in some 30 countries and territories and killed more than 2,300 people, mostly in China. \n At a briefing in Geneva yesterday, Dr Ghebreyesus described the trend in cases having no clear links to China as \"very worrisome\", citing the growing number of cases in Iran in the past few days. Five people out of its 28 cases have died. \n \"Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for Covid-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems,\" said Dr Ghebreyesus, noting that the agency is helping to prepare African countries for \"the potential arrival of the virus\". \n It has identified 13 priority countries in the continent that have direct links to China and has appealed for US$675 million (S$944 million) in funds to support the most vulnerable. \n WHO has been advising countries on screening, testing, contact tracing and treatment. \n WHO's warning comes as a study in Britain predicted that as many as two-thirds of infections exported from China may have gone undetected globally, which had the potential for a massive outbreak. \n Using data from air travel, scientists at Imperial College London found some countries to have identified far fewer cases than expected based on the number of passengers arriving from Wuhan. \n Lebanon confirmed its first case on Friday, a 45-year-old Lebanese woman who had travelled from Qom in Iran. New cases were also reported in the United Arab Emirates, which yesterday confirmed that an Iranian tourist and his wife had been sickened by the coronavirus, raising the total number to 13. \n Iran's outbreak is worrying public health officials there and in the WHO. The authorities have not confirmed its origin, but one health official has suggested that it could have been imported by Chinese workers. \n Neighbouring countries have started to take action. Turkey has said all travellers from Iran will have to undergo medical checks, while Bahrain has issued an advisory against travel there. \n Northern Italy is also on alert after two deaths were caused by the coronavirus - a 75-year-old woman yesterday in Lombardy and a 78-year-old man the day before in Veneto. The region has 51 cases now. \n Meanwhile, a WHO-led mission in China for the past week travelled to Wuhan yesterday. State media Global Times said the expert team will collect wild animal samples to trace the origin of the new coronavirus and check quarantine conditions in the makeshift hospitals. \n "}, {"content": "Lungenkrankheit in China: Was Reisende wissen müssen. \nIn China treten immer mehr Fälle der tödlichen Lungenkrankheit auf. Mit der gerade laufenden Reisewelle zum chinesischen Neujahrsfest am kommenden Samstag (25. Januar) wächst die Gefahr einer Übertragung weiter. Bei der größten jährlichen Völkerwanderung sind einige Hundert Millionen Chinesen unterwegs.\nIm Kampf gegen die Ausbreitung hat die chinesische Hauptstadt Peking alle größeren Veranstaltungen und Tempelfeste anlässlich des chinesischen Neujahrsfestes nun gestrichen. Die städtische Tourismusbehörde teilte mit, dass damit „die Ansammlungen von Menschen verringert werden sollen“. Die Gesundheit habe Vorrang.\nDie Anweisung gilt von sofort an und betrifft auch die traditionellen Jahrmärkte in den Tempeln der Hauptstadt, die normalerweise über die zwei Wochen andauernden Neujahrsfeierlichkeiten stattfinden. Auch der Kaiserpalast und Teile der Großen Mauer sind von Samstag an für Besucher geschlossen. Betroffen ist der bei Touristen beliebte Mauerabschnitt Badaling im Norden von Peking.\nChinas Gesundheitskommission erklärte, die anfänglichen Infektionen wurden mit einem inzwischen geschlossenen Fischmarkt in Wuhan in Verbindung gebracht, auf dem auch Wildtiere verkauft wurden. Der Großteil der Infektionen konzentrierte sich weiter auf die 11-Millionen-Metropole.\nIm Kampf gegen eine Verbreitung der Lungenkrankheit sind in der schwer betroffenen zentralchinesischen Provinz Hubei strikte Bewegungsbeschränkungen für rund 37 Millionen Menschen erlassen worden. Als die jüngsten drei Metropolen wurden in Jingzhou (5,6 Millionen Einwohner), Xiaogan (5 Millionen) und in Dangyang (470.000) der öffentliche Verkehr und die Züge in andere Orte gestoppt, wie die Stadtregierungen berichteten. Damit sind mit der Provinzhauptstadt Wuhan mindestens elf Städte praktisch abgeschottet worden.\nCoronaviren verursachen oft harmlose Erkrankungen wie Erkältungen - Analysen des Erbguts hatten dem Berliner Virusforscher Christian Drosten zufolge aber ergeben, dass es sich bei dem Erreger um eine Sars-Variante handelt. Sars steht für „Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome“, also Schweres Akutes Atemwegssyndrom. Ein Sars-Virus hatte von China ausgehend 2002/2003 eine weltweite Pandemie mit 8000 Infizierten zur Folge, etwa 800 Menschen starben.\nAm Flughafen Frankfurt werden Reisende aus und Reisende in die Region bei Wuhan über die Symptome aufgeklärt und wie sie damit umgehen sollen, erklärte ein Sprecher des Gesundheitsamtes in Frankfurt. Das geschieht etwa auf großen Informationstafeln am Flughafen oder auf der Internetseite des Auswärtigen Amtes. „Man muss einfach schauen, wie sich das Geschehen global weiterentwickelt und dann müssen wir natürlich auch die Informationen anpassen“, erklärte der Sprecher weiter. Aktuell seien Reise- und Verhaltensempfehlungen ausreichend. Bei begründeten Verdachtsfällen würden betroffene Menschen isoliert sowie beobachtet werden, hieß es vom Amt.\nDeutsche Reiseveranstalter und Lufthansa sind wegen der Ausbreitung der neuen Lungenkrankheit in China im Austausch mit den Behörden. „Die Veranstalter halten engen Kontakt zum Auswärtigen Amt und beobachten die Entwicklung aufmerksam“, sagte eine Sprecherin des Branchenverbandes DRV. Die Lufthansa spürt nach Angaben eines Sprechers bislang keine Zurückhaltung der Kunden bei den Buchungen. Man könne jederzeit fertig geplante Notfallmaßnahmen starten, sagte der Sprecher.\nDer deutsche Branchenprimus Tui hat nach eigenen Angaben derzeit nur sehr wenige Gäste in China. \"Entsprechend verzeichnen wir aktuell auch keinen erhöhten Informationsbedarf\", sagte eine Sprecherin. Gäste vor Ort seien via SMS über die Reise- und Sicherheitshinweise des Auswärtigen Amtes informiert worden. Bei DER Touristik gingen nach eigenen Angaben bisher nur wenige Anfragen von Kunden zum Corona-Virus ein. Auch der Veranstalter Berge & Meer verzeichnet bislang weder vermehrte Rückfragen noch Stornierungsanfragen.\nChina-Reisende können ihren Pauschalurlaub nicht allein aus Angst vor der neuen Lungenkrankheit kostenlos absagen. Ein Rücktritt vom Reisevertrag rein aus Furcht sei derzeit nicht ohne Stornogebühren möglich, erklärt die Reiserechtsexpertin Sabine Fischer-Volk von der Kanzlei Karimi in Berlin.\n„Eine Ausnahme bestünde nur dann, wenn für ein konkretes Reiseziel oder Hotel eine Quarantänemaßnahme ausgerufen würde, sodass man dort keinen Urlaub machen kann oder nur mit großen Einschränkungen“, sagt die Rechtsanwältin. Das ist derzeit nicht der Fall.\nFischer-Volk rät China-Reisenden, sich regelmäßig über die Reise- und Sicherheitshinweise des Auswärtigen Amtes (AA) zu informieren. Dieses rät aktuell nicht von China-Reisen ab - eine wichtige Bedingung, um Pauschalurlaub kostenlos stornieren zu können.\nIn den Reise- und Sicherheitshinweisen heißt es lediglich: „Vermeiden Sie den Kontakt mit kranken Menschen und allen Tieren, meiden Sie Märkte mit Tierprodukten und achten Sie gesteigert auf ihre Handhygiene.“ Außerdem sollten Reisende umgehend zu einem Arzt, wenn sie Fieber und Anzeichen einer Atemwegsinfektion entwickeln.\nIndividualreisende, die nicht fliegen wollen, können sich die Ticketkosten nicht von der Airline erstatten zu lassen.\nDie EU-Präventionsbehörde ECDC sieht vorerst ein moderates Risiko, dass der Erreger in die Europäische Union eingeschleppt wird. Dies teilte das Europäische Zentrum für die Prävention und die Kontrolle von Krankheiten im schwedischen Solna mit.\nZum Schutz gegen die Lungenkrankheit schloss Nordkorea nach Angaben von Reiseagenturen vorerst seine Grenzen für ausländische Touristen. Nordkorea lasse seit Mittwoch (22. Januar) keine Touristen mehr einreisen, teilten die in China ansässigen Agenturen Young Pioneer Tours und Koryo Tours auf ihren Webseiten mit. Von Nordkorea gab es zunächst keine offizielle Bestätigung.\nChinas asiatische Nachbarn, die USA und Großbritannien haben wegen der Lungenkrankheit inzwischen Fieberkontrollen bei der Einreise aus Wuhan eingeführt. Auch Italien setzt nach Angaben des Gesundheitsministeriums in Rom auf Kontrollen am Flughafen in Rom, um mögliche Verdachtsfälle an Bord von Flugzeugen aus Wuhan zu überprüfen. Und Russland verstärkte die Kontrollen an allen Grenzposten zu China.\nDie französische Fluggesellschaft Air France hat vorerst alle Direktverbindungen von und nach Wuhan in China gestrichen. Die Airline halte sich damit an von Behörden wie der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) empfohlene Maßnahmen, teilte Air France mit.

Some US political leaders’ insistence of labelling COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” has rattled many Asian Americans who are concerned that they will be the targets of more hate crimes. \n One of them is Tzi Ma, the veteran Chinese-American actor who starred in The Farewell and the upcoming Mulan, who fell victim to racial harassment. Speaking to Variety, Ma, 57, recalled an encounter in early February at a Whole Foods grocery store in Pasadena, where a car approached him as he made his way to the store entrance. \n “He rolls down the window and goes, ‘You should be quarantined,’ and then he took off,” said Ma. He added that incident left him speechless and he yelled back at the drive-by verbal assaulter, who had already fled the scene. “This is emotional,” he said. “This affected my psyche.” \n Last week, Ma joined the digital campaign called #WashTheHate, which aims to raise awareness of COVID-19-related anti-Asian sentiment. The campaign features videos from Asian-American artists, influencers and leaders washing their hands for 20 seconds and sharing personal stories about how the virus has impacted their lives.  \n #WashTheHate pic.twitter.com/NTfYHA0JGZ \n In the Variety interview, Ma urged other members of the Asian-American community to stay alert when they’re out and about. “I think we all need to be very vigilant. I think we all need to be a little bit more hypersensitive to our surroundings, keep our eyes and ears open.” \n Ma also has a few words for the anti-Asians out there. “Does it stop the virus?,” he asked. “I don’t think so. Does it make you immune to the virus? I don’t think so. With this kind of hatred, you’re going to be sick, ‘cause it can’t be good for you.” \n Korean-American actor Daniel Dae Kim, who revealed he was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Thursday, also condemned the COVID-19-inspired racism. “Please, please stop the prejudice and senseless violence against Asian people,” he said in Instagram. \n “Randomly beating elderly, sometimes homeless Asian Americans is cowardly, heartbreaking and it’s inexcusable. Yes, I’m Asian, and yes, I have coronavirus, but I did not get it from China. I got it in America, in New York City.” \n Bernice A King, the daughter of civil rights leader Dr Martin Luther King Jr, showed her solidarity with Asian-Americans by sharing Kim’s quote in her Twitter post.  \n “Please, please stop the prejudice and senseless violence against Asian people. Randomly beating elderly, sometimes homeless Asian Americans is cowardly, heartbreaking and it’s inexcusable.”https://t.co/cO1zlbrVFV \n Using dangerous rhetoric to incite racism isn't what is needed right now.

Stay safe ❤️ \n Hey @JohnCornyn “This is Chinese culture and every disease comes from there.” is factually false and worse is a clear rallying call for idiots to go after people who look Asian.

Existem, neste momento, 60 milhões de italianos debaixo de uma quarentena apertada. Um país fechado em casa que só pode sair por “motivos comprovados de saúde ou trabalho”, como ditou o decreto do Governo de Giuseppe Conte. São medidas extremas para tentar travar a progressão do novo coronavírus, porque em 17 dias Itália passou de ter três doentes diagnosticados com covid-19 e transformou-se no país com o maior número de casos e mortes fora da China: 17.660 e 1266, respectivamente.\nComo se a pressão que estes números colocam no sistema de saúde e no Governo não bastasse, Itália também está a enfrentar uma taxa de letalidade acima da média — cerca de 7% da população infectada (ou pelo menos diagnosticada) já morreu.\nA 31 de Janeiro de 2020 foram identificados os primeiros casos em dois turistas chineses de visita a Roma. E este número manteve-se estável durante semanas, com as autoridades a tentarem perceber o percurso dos infectados em Itália.\nSó quase 20 dias mais tarde, a 22 de Fevereiro, seria confirmado o primeiro caso de contaminação interna numa cidade a cerca de 60 quilómetros de Milão: a pequena Codogno, no Norte de Itália, confirmou seis casos de infecção pelo novo coronavírus e decidiu encerrar todos os locais públicos e privados, incluindo escolas, serviços e supermercados. \nNo dia seguinte, os “alarmes” voltavam a soar: as autoridades italianas confirmaram duas mortes por coronavírus e cerca de seis dezenas de novas infecções, quando 24 horas antes existiam menos de dez casos confirmados. E desde esse dia que os números não param de se multiplicar.\nAs regiões do Norte da Lombardia, Véneto e Emilia Romagna estão a ser as mais afectadas pelo surto — 85% dos infectados são dessa região, que regista cerca de 90% das mortes. Mas o vírus já foi confirmado em todas as 20 regiões do país.\nEsta quinta-feira, a contagem de mortos do surto do novo coronavírus subiu 250, para 1266 óbitos. O número total de casos aumentou para 17.660​, face aos 15.113 desta quinta-feira, uma subida de 16,8%. É a maior subida diária em números absolutos desde que o contágio se acelerou.\nPara a situação ter evoluído de uma forma tão rápida, as autoridades italianas acreditam que o novo coronavírus entrou no país muito antes de o primeiro caso ter sido detectado, como diz à revista Time Flavia Riccardo, investigadora do Departamento de Doenças Infecciosas do Instituto Nacional de Saúde da Itália. “Tudo isto aconteceu exactamente quando estávamos a lidar com o nosso pico de gripe A, quando os cidadãos apresentavam sintomas dessa patologia”, refere.\nAinda antes da confirmação dos primeiros casos, existia um número anormalmente alto doentes com pneumonia num hospital em Codogno e estas instalações de saúde podem ter-se tornado focos de infecção. Como o vírus se espalhou durante algumas semanas sem ser detectado, as autoridades acreditam que este pode ser um dos motivos que explicam porque é que os números italianos no que toca à covid-19 são tão altos. “No momento em que nos apercebemos [da doença], já existiam muitas cadeias de transmissão activas “, diz a investigadora à Time.\nAlém disso, avança a especialista, a Itália pode ter um número maior de casos registados como resultado da realização de testes mais rigorosos do que os restantes países: já testou mais de 40 mil pessoas. No entanto, isso não explica a letalidade.\nPor enquanto, o padrão de mortes registado em Itália é semelhante ao verificado na China. São os mais idosos e com doenças associadas, como cancro, diabetes, doenças respiratórias e outras que deprimem o sistema imunitário que estão a ser mais afectados. Segundo revelou o Instituto Nacional de Saúde, a média das idades dos pacientes com coronavírus que morreram em Itália é de 81 anos.\nMas os números são altos: a Alemanha, com 2369 infectados soma apenas cinco mortos, enquanto a Itália, com um número parecido (2502 a 4 de Março) já registava 80; a Espanha tem 4209 casos e 120 mortes, enquanto Itália com 4636 casos (a 7 de Março) tinha 197 mortes.\nComo já se sabia, os idosos são um dos grupos particularmente susceptíveis ao vírus e a Itália tem a população mais envelhecida da Europa, com 23% com 65 anos ou mais. Em termos mundiais, é apenas ultrapassada pelo Japão. Mas pode isso ajudar a explicar um número tão elevado de mortes?\nConstantino Sakellarides, antigo director-geral da Saúde, professor jubilado da Escola Nacional de Saúde Pública e actual membro do Conselho Nacional de Saúde Pública, explica que o caso italiano pode estar relacionado com o facto de o Norte de Itália ser umas das regiões mais “prósperas” do mundo. “Não é por acaso que isto aconteceu em Milão e não em Lisboa. Tem que ver com as intensas relações que a China mantém com os núcleos empresariais mais desenvolvidos do mundo, entre estes Milão”, refere o especialista, realçando que, no entanto, o facto de o Norte de Itália ser uma região rica faz com que esteja muito bem servida em termos de serviços de saúde.\nSobre as mortes associada ao vírus e registadas até à data no país, nomeadamente entre as pessoas mais idosas, o especialista de saúde pública prefere focar-se no método de cálculo dos óbitos. “É difícil associar as mortes em Itália apenas a uma população envelhecida, e não podemos falar em taxa de mortalidade, mas sim em taxa de letalidade. A primeira é o número de mortos na população e a segunda são as vítimas na população infectada. Quando dizemos 6%, estamos a falar de 6% dos doentes e não de 6% da população italiana, já que isso seria uma catástrofe”, explica o ex-director-geral da Saúde. Constantino Sakellarides argumenta que a situação em Itália é “dramática”, mas é difícil baseá-la só no envelhecimento dos cidadãos, porque a Coreia do Sul ou o Japão são tão (ou mais) envelhecidos. Segundo os últimos dados divulgados, a Coreia do Sul regista, até agora, 7979 casos confirmados e 66 mortes, e o Japão detectou 639 casos e 16 mortes. \nO especialista rejeita encarar Itália como um caso especial face aos outros países exportadores do novo coronavírus e considera que o caso italiano, o mais grave da epidemia fora da China, se relaciona com “a perda de capacidade de contenção”.\nÀ luz das recentes medidas tomadas pelo Governo italiano, num esforço desmedido para conter o vírus, Constantino Sakellarides explica que, enquanto outros países tiveram tempo de aprender e estudar a forma como o SARS-CoV-2 se transmite, a Itália não teve essa sorte. “Nós, tal como outros países, já tivemos mais de dois meses da experiência chinesa e outras semanas de experiência italiana para lidar com o vírus. As medidas chinesas foram muito musculadas, e a maior parte dos países não são capazes de implementar esforços deste tipo”, explica o especialista em saúde pública. “A Itália não teve o benefício de aprender com outros países sem ser a China e tenho a impressão que actuou mais tarde; daí que agora vários países estejam a actuar mais cedo, como é o caso de Portugal.”\nSegundo o especialista, este vírus, devido à sua transmissibilidade e ao seu período de incubação, está a circular muito mais depressa do que parece. “Há um aumento pequeno no início e depois um aumento exponencial, como já vimos em vários países, como Espanha, Dinamarca e a própria Itália. Nós tomámos a decisão de encerrar muitos espaços públicos e escolas aos 80 casos, a Dinamarca aos 500, e a Espanha aos 2000. Apesar de “benefício” ser uma palavra perigosa nesta altura, nós pudemos beneficiar dos exemplos e tomar uma decisão destas muito antes dos outros”, acredita o ex-consultor do anterior ministro da Saúde. “E não nos podemos esquecer que a pressão social também tem muito impacto nestas decisões políticas de fechar escolas e outros espaços públicos”.\nDe acordo com um estudo publicado esta sexta-feira na revista científica The Lancet por dois investigadores italianos, o número de pacientes infectados desde 21 de Fevereiro na Itália está a seguir uma “tendência exponencial”. “Se esta tendência continuar durante mais uma semana, existirão 30 mil pacientes infectados”, avançam.\nSegundo esta investigação, que fornece informações actualizadas sobre o cenário italiano, a média das idades das pessoas que morreram no país foi de 81 anos e mais de dois terços destes pacientes tinham diabetes, doenças cardiovasculares ou cancro. “Ainda que seja verdade que estes doentes já tinham outros problemas de saúde, também é importante notar que, por causa do SARS-CoV-2, precisavam de suporte respiratório e não teriam morrido de outra forma”, avança o estudo.\nDas primeiras 827 vítimas mortais, 14,1% tinham mais de 90 anos, 42,2% tinham entre 80 e 89 anos, 32,4% entre 70 e 79 anos, 8,4% entre 60 e 69 anos e só 2,8% entre 50 e 59 anos.\nExistem, em Itália, cerca de 5200 camas nas unidades de cuidados intensivos. Destas, avançam os investigadores, mais de mil já estão a ser ocupadas por cidadãos infectados pelo SARS-CoV-2. “Num futuro próximo, este número aumentará progressivamente até ao ponto em que milhares de camas serão ocupadas por pacientes com covid-19. Dado que a mortalidade de pacientes gravemente doentes é alta, o número de pessoas infectadas em Itália vai, provavelmente, pôr uma grande pressão nos cuidados intensivos dos hospitais, alguns dos quais não dispõem de recursos ou equipas adequados para lidar com esta emergência”, acreditam os investigadores. Este factor pode fazer subir a mortalidade.\nOs dois especialistas acreditam que as medidas de restrição têm de continuar a ser impostas para que o que aconteceu na China não aconteça em Itália. “Se o surto italiano seguir uma tendência semelhante ao da China, podemos esperar que o número de pacientes recém-infectados comece a diminuir. Da mesma forma, podemos prever que a curva cumulativa de pacientes infectados atingirá seu pico 30 dias depois”, sugere os autores.\nEnquanto os outros países lidam todos os dias com novos casos do SARS-CoV-2, a China registou esta sexta-feira apenas oito novos casos de infecção, o número mais baixo desde que iniciou a contagem diária, em Janeiro. Até à meia-noite de quinta-feira (16h00 horas de quarta-feira, em Lisboa), a China continental registava 3169 mortes e um total de 80.793 infectados. Mas 62.793 pessoas receberam alta após terem superado a doença, até à data, restando 14.831 em tratamento.\nOs papéis parecem ter-se invertido: face aos casos importados, uma das prioridades das autoridades chinesas é agora “protegerem-se contra a importação” de infecções de outros países. Os números têm vindo a cair acentuadamente face ao mês passado, altura em que o número de novos casos ascendia aos mais de mil por dia. O porta-voz da Comissão Nacional de Saúde, Mi Feng, disse quinta-feira que o pico da epidemia já passou na China, mas que “o rápido desenvolvimento da epidemia no exterior trouxe novas incertezas”.\nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\nNota: os números que constam das infografias deste artigo foram recolhidos pelo PÚBLICO durante a manhã do dia 13 de Março.

NEW DELHI - India could face between around 100,000 and 1.3 million confirmed cases of the disease caused by the new coronavirus by mid-May if it continues to spread at its current pace, according to a team of scientists based mainly in the United States.  \n The estimates reinforce concerns among some medical officials and experts in India that the country of 1.4 billion people could see coronavirus cases jump sharply in the coming weeks and put its health system under severe strain.  \n The scientists said projections could change as the country conducts more testing, while also putting in place stricter restrictions and measures to stem the spread of the virus.  \n \"Even with the best case scenarios, probably, you are in a very painful crisis,\" said Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan who was involved in the study.  \n The study was carried out by the COV-IND-19 Study Group of scholars and scientists looking into the threat posed by the coronavirus, and COVID-19, the disease it causes, in India.  \n The analysis first appeared on Medium, a U.S. publishing platform, on Saturday.  \n India probably has only around 100,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 40,000 ventilators, said Dhruva Chaudhry, president of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, based on industry estimates and other data.  \n \"We can handle it if an even number (of cases) come over a period of time,\" Chaudhry said. But he warned that there was not sufficient infrastructure or staff to handle a sharp spike in critical patients.  \n India's federal health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research did not respond to questions about the forecasts.  \n  \n PARTIAL LOCKDOWN  \n So far, India has reported 471 cases of the coronavirus and 9 deaths, numbers dwarfed by countries like China, Italy and Spain, but which are nonetheless beginning to accelerate.  \n Authorities have imposed a lockdown across large parts of the country, including in the capital city New Delhi and the financial hub of Mumbai.  \n The original study was based on data up to March 16, but following a request from Reuters, the team updated their model using cases from Indian health authorities up to March 21.  \n The model was based on one used by colleagues to analyse the coronavirus outbreak in Hubei, China, and employed a set of equations taking into account the number of susceptible people, those infected and those who recovered.  \n That created a predictive model for case counts in India and provided projections under hypothetical public health interventions of varying intensities.  \n According to the estimates, the number of confirmed cases could rise to more than 4,000 by the end of March and to between 30,000 and 230,000 by end-April.  \n Although the researchers have not projected the number of fatalities, Mukherjee said India could be hard hit because of large numbers of people with existing conditions who were potentially more vulnerable to the virus.  \n  \n EARLY CONTAINMENT  \n India has tested around 20,000 individuals, and health authorities have said the virus has remained largely restricted to those who travelled to affected areas and others who came into direct contact with them.  \n India has shut down its massive railways network, banned all incoming international flights and has ordered commercial airlines to stop domestic operations from midnight on Tuesday.  \n But some health officials are concerned that individuals from high-risk areas may not have been caught by multiple safety nets, allowing the virus to spread.  \n Over the weekend, a group of federal lawmakers and bureaucrats in New Delhi were forced to self-quarantine after a Bollywood singer who travelled from London tested positive for the virus in a neighbouring northern state.  \n The singer had earlier been at an event attended by a member of parliament, who subsequently went to several meetings in New Delhi.  \n Mukherjee said India needed quickly to undertake large-scale testing and contact tracing for exposed individuals.  \n \"But if there is expanded community transmission, central lockdown may be the only way,\" she said.

The latest country after Singapore to confirm its first case is Vietnam.  \n CONTRACT TRACING \n With the results confirmed, Mr Dolp said that the Government is aware of the identities of the four isolated hotel employees and their conditions are being monitored by the Government as well.  \n The hotel will support MOH’s efforts in contact tracing beyond the four workers, through the use of surveillance footage and so forth, he added.  \n  Mr Josef Dolp, the executive vice-president of operations for Southeast Asia and Australasia of Shangri-La Group, said that hotel employees have been reminded to practise strict hygiene habits at all times. Photo: CNA \n In recent weeks, due to the growing threat of the virus which causes fever, pneumonia and other flu-like symptoms, Mr Dolp said that the hotel has been taking more precautionary measures. After guests have checked out, the rooms have been thoroughly disinfected and sanitised. \n “We have increased our cleaning and sanitising frequency of guest rooms, hotel facilities and all public areas. Temperature checks are in place for our guests and colleagues.  \n “We have also reminded our staff to practise strict hygiene habits at all times, to stay at home if they are not feeling well and to seek medical attention immediately if they believe they have some symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness,” he added.  \n Mr Dolp said that they will work with other hotel guests who might have concerns about transmission.  \n “We will, of course, install information desks… we will address questions the guests have. We will also, if they want to move, help them to move.” \n The authorities in China confirmed a few days ago that the coronavirus could be transmitted from human to human.  \n Coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people. In rare cases, they evolve and spread from human to human. \n The new virus, known as 2019-nCoV, is a strain that has not been previously identified in humans. \n It is in the same family as the ones that caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), as well as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak which killed almost 800 people worldwide from 2002 to 2003, including 33 in Singapore. \n The Sars virus was transmitted from civet cats to humans and the one causing Mers was from one-hump camels to humans. \n To date, the source of the new virus has not yet been established. \n "}, {"content": "Coronavírus.

SINGAPORE — China’s embassy in Singapore has slammed former diplomat Bilahari Kausikan over a commentary in The Straits Times, saying that it misinterpreted and smeared China’s political and leadership systems, and was no different from the stereotypical “cliche of Western anti-China voices”. \n The embassy said in its 589-word broadside published on its Facebook page on Tuesday (Feb 25): “All constructive comments and suggestions are welcomed, but arrogance and prejudice through coloured glasses are unacceptable. \n “This kind of arrogance and prejudice is manifested as… hostility towards anything related to China.” \n The embassy added: “Aiming to obstruct China’s sound development momentum, they attack China's political system and development model, and try to undermine China's social stability.”   \n Asked for his response to the Chinese embassy’s criticism, Mr Bilahari, who chairs the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore, told TODAY: “What else could they say? All Chinese diplomats are under pressure to respond to President Xi’s instruction to assert China’s narrative.” \n He added that the embassy did not address any substantive point that he made. \n “Instead, they raise arguments against points I did not make, which is quite typical. It is not something I can take seriously.” \n In his commentary published on Monday, titled Coronavirus: China’s inflection point and the CCP’s fundamental dilemma, Mr Bilahari, a former permanent secretary at Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, described China as a Leninist state led by a vanguard party that insists on absolute control. \n The Covid-19 outbreak — which began in Wuhan, China and has since spread around the world — is a consequence of this Leninist value system. It has also dented the credibility of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with the Chinese people, Mr Bilahari said.  \n He wrote that the CCP’s legitimacy rests on economic performance and it has to confront a fundamental dilemma: The essence of a Leninist state is the party’s insistence on control, yet the market — by definition — means less control. \n Mr Bilahari said that it was unclear if China would go beyond fixing the serious flaws in its healthcare system after the coronavirus crisis tails off, and deal with the fundamental challenge of finding a new balance between control and economic efficiency. \n He noted that in the long sweep of Chinese history, the times of maximum danger for ruling dynasties were when periods of internal uncertainty coincided with those of external uncertainty. \n “We may be in such a time,” Mr Bilahari wrote, arguing that the CCP is nearing an “inflection point” and fundamental decisions “cannot continue to be postponed indefinitely”. \n ‘WHETHER THE SHOE FITS OR NOT, ONLY THE WEARER KNOWS’ \n In its Facebook post, the Chinese embassy said that at a time when China is “making enormous efforts and sacrifices” to fight the virus outbreak, Mr Bilahari’s sense of justice to “ideologically denigrate China and sell his long-held prejudice and even hostility towards China has to be questioned”. \n “Whether the shoe fits or not, only the wearer knows. \n “Whether a country's development path is right or not only depends on whether it is in line with the country's reality,” the embassy said. \n The embassy also set out a series of feats that China has achieved in the last seven decades, including rising to become the world’s second-biggest economy and lifting more than 800 million people out of poverty. \n “Such achievements, unique in human history, have been made under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and under the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics. \n “It has not only benefited the Chinese people, but also brought abundant opportunities to the prosperity and development for the rest of the world,” the embassy stated. \n It added that China’s political system and development path have effectively solved the principal social contradictions and problems across different periods of China’s growth. \n “Though Mr Bilahari himself did not deny China's great achievements, he still criticised the political system and the leadership system that created them,” the embassy said. \n “Actually, it is logically self-contradictory.” \n The embassy said that China’s firm commitment to upholding the CCP and its central committee, with Chinese President Xi Jinping at its core, would not waver. \n It reiterated: “Facts have proved and will continue to prove that nothing can derogate the advantages of the socialism with Chinese characteristics.” \n The embassy also stressed that Mr Xi, who is the general secretary of the CCP, is in “full command” and the country is united in fighting the coronavirus epidemic, which it called “the enemy to all mankind”. \n The embassy added: “Mr Bilahari put the blame of the outbreak on China's political system. Then regarding… the H1N1 flu that originated in North America and spread worldwide, which one should be blamed? \n “At the moment, what the world needs most is unity and trust, not the political virus that keeps people at bay.” \n "}, {"content": "Vírus chinês empurra bolsas para o vermelho.

BEIJING (XINHUA) - China and Italy reaffirmed bilateral ties in a phone call between the two countries' foreign ministers, with Beijing offering to provide Rome with medical aid to help fight the coronavirus. Separately, eastern Zhejiang province donated thousands of boxes of protective gear to help overseas Chinese in the European nation. \n In the phone call on Tuesday (March 10), Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said the two nations' friendship would see new progress as they work to tackle the fast-spreading virus. \n Mr Di Maio briefed on Italy's latest development on the epidemic prevention and control work, and thanked China for its support for Italy. \n Pointing out the severe situation in Italy at present, Mr Di Maio said the Italian government is paying close attention to and learning from China's successful experience in the battle against the virus, taking strong measures to prevent the spread of the disease. \n Italy is facing a shortage of medical supplies and equipment, said Mr Di Maio, expressing hopes that China would help resolve their urgent need. \n Overseas Chinese living in Italy have played an active role in the fight against the epidemic, said Mr Di Maio, adding that Italy will continue to take full care of their health and safety. \n Mr Wang said that as a good friend and comprehensive strategic partner of Italy, China fully understands the challenges Italy is confronting. \n The epidemic knows no border and is a common enemy of mankind, Mr Wang noted as he called for solidarity from the international community to combat the virus. \n Upholding the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, China is dedicated not only to making all-out efforts to keep the Chinese people safe and sound, but also to making contributions to global public health security, Mr Wang said. \n China recently made donations to the World Health Organisation to support international cooperation on the Covid-19 fight. China is also offering help within its capacity to countries where the epidemic situation is severe or where medical conditions are poor, Mr Wang said. \n Noting that the Chinese people will not forget Italy's support when China was facing its toughest moment in the fight against the virus, Mr Wang said China is now willing to stand firmly by the side of the Italian people. \n Though China itself at present still needs a large amount of medical materials, the country, overcoming the difficulties, will offer Italy with assistance like medical materials including face masks, and accelerate and enhance the exports of supplies and equipment to meet Italy's urgent need, Mr Wang said. \n If the Italian side requires, Mr Wang said, China would like to send medical personnel to Italy to help combat the novel coronavirus. \n The Chinese cities and provinces that enjoy friendship relations with their Italian peers, as well as Chinese enterprises, will also offer support and aid to Italy, the minister added. \n Mr Wang said he believes the joint battle against the coronavirus will help deepen bilateral relations between the two countries, and enhance the friendship between the two peoples. \n China appreciates that the Italian side has paid high attention to the health and safety of the Chinese nationals in Italy, and hopes that Italy will continue to offer them necessary help and support, the minister said. \n Hand in hand, China and Italy will prevail over the epidemic eventually, Mr Wang added. \n On Wednesday, China's eastern Zhejiang province sent 3.86 million pieces, or 4,556 boxes, of protective gear to help overseas Chinese in Italy. \n A cargo plane loaded with 26.4 tonnes of disposable masks, N95 medical masks, goggles, latex gloves and other protective clothing left the provincial capital of Hangzhou for Europe at 5.50am, Xinhua reported.  \n Zhejiang’s first batch of donations for overseas Chinese came from people from all walks of life in the province. More than 300,000 Chinese people from Zhejiang live in Italy.  \n “Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus, overseas Chinese of Zhejiang origin have tried every means to purchase epidemic prevention materials and support their hometown to fight the epidemic,” said Mr Zhang Weiren, vice-chairman of the Zhejiang Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. “Overseas Chinese are now in difficulty, and their relatives in the motherland should give them the utmost support.\" \n Due to the suspension of direct flights between China and Italy, the donations would arrive first in Liege, Belgium, and then be transferred to Italy, said Mr Gao Kaiyong, deputy chief of the general office of the Zhejiang Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. \n “If all goes well, the goods will arrive in Turin, Italy, this weekend,” \n "}, {"content": "How do bats live with so many viruses?. If previous outbreaks of coronavirus are any indication, the Wuhan strain that is now spreading may eventually be traced back to bats. \n Dr Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, who has been working in China for 15 years, studying diseases that jump from animals to people, said: \"We don't know the source yet, but there's pretty strong evidence that this is a bat-origin coronavirus.\" \n \"It's probably going to be the Chinese horseshoe bat,\" he added, referring to a common species that weighs up to 28g. \n If he is right, this strain will join many other viruses that bats carry. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics were caused by bat coronaviruses, as was a highly destructive viral epidemic in pigs. One bat can host many different viruses without getting sick. \n They are the natural reservoir for the Marburg virus, and Nipah and Hendra viruses, which have caused human disease and outbreaks in Africa, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Australia. \n They are thought to be the natural reservoir for the Ebola virus. They also carry the rabies virus, but in that case the bats are affected by the disease. Their tolerance of viruses, which surpasses that of other mammals, is one of their many distinctive qualities. \n They are the only flying mammals, they devour disease-carrying insects by the ton, and they are essential in the pollination of many fruits, like bananas, avocados and mangoes. They are also an incredibly diverse group, making up about a quarter of all mammalian species. \n But their ability to coexist with viruses that can spill over to other animals, in particular humans, can have devastating consequences when we eat them, trade them in livestock markets and invade their territory. \n Learning how they carry and survive so many viruses has been a deep question for science, and new research suggests that the answer may be how the bats' evolutionary adaptations to flight changed their immune systems. \n In a 2018 paper in Cell Host And Microbe, scientists in China and Singapore reported their investigation of how bats handle something called DNA sensing. \n The energy demands of flight are so great that cells in the body break down and release bits of DNA that are then floating around where they should not be. Mammals, including bats, have ways to identify and respond to such bits of DNA, which might indicate an invasion of a disease-causing organism. \n But in bats, the scientists found, evolution has weakened that system, which would normally cause inflammation as it fought the viruses. \n Bats have lost some genes involved in that response, which makes sense because the inflammation itself can be very damaging to the body. They have a weakened response, but it is still there. \n Thus, the researchers write, this weakened response may allow them to maintain a \"balanced state of 'effective response' but not 'over response' against viruses\". \n How to manage and contain the current outbreak of the virus officially known as nCoV-2019 is, of course, of paramount importance now. But tracing its origin and taking action to combat further outbreaks may depend partly on knowledge and monitoring of bats. \n \"The outbreak can be contained and controlled,\" Dr Daszak said. \"But if we don't know the origin in the long term, then this virus can continue to spill over.\" \n Scientists in China were already studying the bats carefully, well aware that an outbreak like the current one would most likely happen. \n In the spring, in an article on bat coronaviruses, or CoVs, a group of Chinese researchers wrote that \"it is generally believed that bat-borne CoVs will re-emerge to cause the next disease outbreak.\" \n They added: \"In this regard, China is a likely hot spot.\" \n This was not clairvoyance, but conventional wisdom. \n Certainly rodents, primates and birds also carry diseases that can and have jumped to people; bats are far from alone in that regard. \n But there are reasons they have been implicated in several disease outbreaks and are likely to be implicated in more. They are numerous and widespread. While bats account for a quarter of mammalian species, rodents are 50 per cent, and then there is the rest of us. \n Bats live on every continent except Antarctica, in proximity to humans and farms. The ability to fly makes them wide-ranging, which helps in spreading viruses, and their faeces can spread disease. \n People in many parts of the world eat bats and sell them in live animal markets, which was the source of Sars and possibly the latest coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan. \n Bats also often live in huge colonies in caves, where crowded conditions are ideal for passing viruses to one another. \n In a 2017 report in Nature, Dr Daszak, Dr Kevin J. Olival and other colleagues from EcoHealth Alliance reported that they had created a database of 754 mammal species and 586 viral species, and analysed which viruses were harboured by which mammals and how they affected their hosts. \n They confirmed what scientists had thought: \"Bats are host to a significantly higher proportion of zoonoses than all other mammalian orders.\" Zoonoses are diseases that spill over from animals to humans. \n And they do not just survive the viruses they harbour. Bats are remarkably long-lived for small mammals. The big brown bat, a common species in the United States, can live nearly 20 years in the wild. \n Others live closer to 40. One tiny bat in Siberia lived at least 41 years. Animals like house mice live about two years on average. \n While the bats must be studied, their physiology understood, and the viruses they harbour monitored for the sake of public health, that does not mean that the bats are to blame for the outbreak. \n As others have pointed out, humans have encroached on the lives of bats, not vice versa. \n Dr Daszak stressed that stopping the sale of wildlife in markets is essential to curtail future outbreaks. But since such outbreaks are inevitable, he says, monitoring and studying wildlife, like bats, is equally important. \n He compared the situation to terrorism. Both terrorist attacks and disease outbreaks seem inevitable.

SEOUL (REUTERS, AFP) - South Korean officials warned against prematurely calling the peak of the coronavirus outbreak while expressing hope on Monday (March 9) that the country was nearing a“turning point” in the crisis, as the pace of new infections trended lower. \n The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 69 new coronavirus cases on Monday, although a more complete figure would be provided in another update later on Monday. \n The new cases brought South Korea’s total infections to 7,382, while the death toll rose by one to 51, the KCDC said. \n The rate of increase in new infections fell to its lowest in 10 days on Sunday in one of the countries most severely affected outside mainland China. \n “I’m still extremely cautious, but there’s hope we can reach a turning point in the near future,” Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Monday before returning to Seoul from the hard-hit southeastern city of Daegu. \n Health authorities say the number of new infections being identified has dwindled as most of the roughly 200,000 followers of a fringe Christian church at the centre of the epidemic in Daegu have now been tested. \n Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said it was premature to say the crisis was over, as new cases continued to emerge from smaller clusters. \n “There are still many patients arising from Daegu and nearby regions ... and sporadic infections continue to emerge elsewhere, though they’re not spreading as fast,” Kim told a briefing. \n “In fact, now is the time to concentrate all our capabilities to bring a clear reduction in infections.” \n South Korea started rationing surgical masks on Monday after imposing an export ban amid panic buying. \n Mutual travel restrictions imposed by South Korea and Japan also took effect, an issue that rekindled a diplomatic and economic feud between the old foes. \n South Korea suspended visas and visa waivers for Japan on Friday, after Tokyo announced travel restrictions, joining more than 100 other countries limiting arrivals from South Korea. \n The spat, together with oil price swings, sent South Korean shares and the won sharply lower and prompted the finance ministry to issue a verbal warning against disorderly market movement. \n South Korea was the first country to report significant coronavirus numbers outside China, where the disease first emerged. \n But in recent days the focus of global concern has been moving towards Italy and Iran, a quarter of Italy’s population in lockdown Sunday as Rome announced infections soaring past 7,000 and deaths spiking to 366.  \n "}, {"content": "Luís Figo espera que surto do coronavírus não afete o Euro2020 de futebol.

O novo coronavírus já causou mais de 900 mortes e infectou mais de 40.500 pessoas. Os números não deverão parar por aqui e até poderão ser agravados pelo fim das férias prolongadas do Ano Novo Lunar chinês. Para se saber para que países o vírus pode ser importado com mais facilidade, cientistas da Alemanha usaram um modelo computacional. No caso de Portugal, o risco de importação do coronavírus é “muito baixo”, estando o país na 61.ª posição da lista de risco relativo de importação do vírus. A Direcção-Geral da Saúde (DGS) anunciou também esta segunda-feira mais dois casos suspeitos de infecção pelo novo coronavírus – foram seis até agora – e um deles já deu negativo, soube-se ao início da noite. O segundo caso suspeito, que tinha sido encaminhado para o Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, no Porto, teve também um resultado negativo, informou a DGS já esta terça-feira, poucos minutos após a meia-noite.\nJá foram confirmados casos do novo coronavírus em mais de 20 países. Mesmo que a grande maioria dos casos se restrinja à China, continua a preocupação de que se possam espalhar ainda mais pelo mundo. De forma a avaliar o risco de importação de casos para outros países, uma equipa da Universidade Humboldt de Berlim e do Instituto Robert Koch, ambos na Alemanha, usaram um modelo computacional, em que consideraram a distribuição dos casos confirmados na China e a rede de transportes aéreos de 4000 aeroportos e mais de 50.000 rotas aéreas. Incluíram-se já no modelo o encerramento de aeroportos devido à epidemia.\nConcluiu-se que a Tailândia (além da China) é o país que mais provavelmente terá pessoas que cheguem de um dos aeroportos analisados com coronavírus. Nesta lista, segue-se o Japão, a Coreia do Sul, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Estados Unidos, Vietname, Malásia, Singapura e o Camboja. O primeiro país europeu desta lista é a Alemanha, que está na 18.ª posição. Embora Angola esteja na lista de 13 países africanos de prioridade máxima para a Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) na luta contra o novo coronavírus, não integra o top 10 dos países africanos com maior risco de importação neste modelo. Esse top é encabeçado pela Etiópia, seguida pelo Egipto, Quénia, África do Sul, Algéria, Marrocos, Maurícia, Reunião, Nigéria e pela Tunísia. Em termos globais, segundo o modelo, Angola está em 115.º lugar.\n“Portugal tem um risco de importação muito baixo”, diz ao PÚBLICO Dirk Brockmann, da Universidade Humboldt. “Está na 61.ª posição com um relativo risco de importação de 0,01%, que é cerca de 20 vezes menor do que o risco da Alemanha.” Mesmo assim, enquanto a Alemanha tem um risco de 0,2%, a Tailândia tem de 2,2%. Dirk Brockmann refere que o objectivo deste modelo é dar uma perspectiva da situação actual e ser uma ferramenta de análise de risco que possa ser usada por decisores políticos e autoridades de saúde pública. Além de dar indicações para cada país, o modelo fornece dados para aeroportos específicos.\nApesar de já ter dado tanto que falar, ainda não sabemos o suficiente sobre o novo coronavírus. Esforços não têm faltado e cientistas de todo o mundo têm estado atentos ao vírus. Entre as últimas novidades, está a publicação do código biomolecular completo do vírus.\nAmostras do novo coronavírus têm sido processadas em laboratórios de todo o mundo e informação em bruto sobre o código genético tem sido enviada para o repositório dos Institutos Nacionais de Saúde dos Estados Unidos. A partir daí, uma equipa da Universidade da Califórnia em Santa Cruz (nos EUA) recolheu informação de 29.903 nucleótidos – a adenina, timina, citosina e guanina, elementos químicos de base que constituem a molécula de ADN, representadas pelas letras A, T, C e G – e disponibilizou-a na base de dados pública Genome Browser.\n“Ao disponibilizarmos os dados sobre o coronavírus na Genome Browser da Universidade da Califórnia em Santa Cruz, isso permite aos investigadores observar a estrutura do vírus e, ainda mais importante, investigar como o podem atacar”, afirma em comunicado Hiram Clawson, investigador daquela universidade.\nA forma como este coronavírus se transmite tem sido outra das grandes questões. O coronavírus é transmitido por gotículas respiratórias, contacto directo com secreções infectadas e aerossóis em procedimentos terapêuticos que os produzem, refere a DGS. Mas quanto tempo persiste nas superfícies e como pode ser inactivado? Dois professores do Hospital Universitário de Greifswald, na Alemanha, tentaram responder a estas questões.\nPara encontrar respostas, analisaram estudos sobre os coronavírus SARS e MERS. Verificou-se que esses vírus podiam persistir nas superfícies e continuar infecciosos à temperatura ambiente, em média, entre quatro e cinco dias. “Temperaturas baixas e uma elevada humidade no ar aumenta ainda mais o seu tempo de vida”, indica Günter Kampf num comunicado da sua instituição.\nQuanto à inactivação dos vários coronavírus, em testes com soluções desinfectantes, viu-se que agentes com etanol, a vulgar água oxigenada ou hipoclorito de sódio eram eficazes contra coronavírus. Se esses agentes fossem aplicados em concentrações apropriadas, reduziriam as partículas patogénicas de um milhão para 100 em cerca de um minuto. Para os investigadores, estes resultados poderão ser extrapolados para o novo coronavírus. “Analisámos diferentes coronavírus e os resultados foram semelhantes”, assinala Eike Steinmann.\nEsta terça e quarta-feira, cientistas, profissionais de agências de saúde pública, ministros da Saúde e financiadores de investigação estarão reunidos em Genebra (na Suíça) para definir prioridades na investigação e desenvolvimento de medicamentos, diagnósticos e vacinas para o coronavírus. Neste encontro organizado pela OMS em conjunto com a Colaboração Global em Investigação para a Preparação de Doenças Infecciosas, discutir-se-á a origem do vírus, identificar-se-ão falhas de conhecimento ou produtos médicos que deverão ser necessários para minimizar o impacto da epidemia. “Espera-se que o encontro produza uma agenda de investigação global para o novo coronavírus”, refere a OMS em comunicado.\nUma missão internacional liderada pela OMS também chegou à China esta segunda-feira para investigar a epidemia. Os epidemiologistas desta missão estão a tentar perceber melhor como ocorre a transmissão entre pessoas, como é que o vírus se espalha em hospitais ou por que razão morrem algumas pessoas.\nSubscreva gratuitamente as newsletters e receba o melhor da actualidade e os trabalhos mais profundos do Público.\nEsta segunda-feira foi também marcada pela visita do Presidente da China, Xi Jinping, a vários sítios em Pequim, nomeadamente a um centro comunitário, um hospital ou a um centro de controlo de doenças. Xi Jinping foi sempre visto com uma máscara e a sua temperatura foi medida. No hospital de Ditan, onde estão a ser tratados doentes infectados com coronavírus, Xi Jinping chegou a participar numa videoconferência com profissionais de saúde em Wuhan – o epicentro do surto, que o Presidente chinês ainda não visitou.\nEsta é considerada uma rara aparição pública de Xi Jinping durante a epidemia e ocorreu dias depois da morte do médico Li Wenliang, que tentou avisar colegas sobre o vírus e acabou por ser punido por espalhar rumores. A visita também aconteceu no dia em que muitos chineses voltam ao trabalho depois de umas férias prolongadas do Ano Novo Lunar chinês. Por isso, a OMS já realçou que o número de casos fora da China pode ser apenas “a ponta de um icebergue”.\n"}, {"content": "Vila do Conde cria grupo de trabalho para reagir a casos de coronavírus.

A 20-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, travelled 400 miles(675 km) north to Anyang where she infected five relatives, without ever showing signs of infection, Chinese scientists reported on Friday, offering new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.  \n The case study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, offered clues about how the coronavirus is spreading, and suggested why it may be difficult to stop.  \n \"Scientists have been asking if you can have this infection and not be ill?

BANGKOK - Thailand's central bank cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to a record low of 0.75% on Friday as the spread of the coronavirus exerted further pressure on the flagging economy.  \n The Bank of Thailand's monetary policy committee (MPC), in a special meeting, voted unanimously to lower the one-day repurchase rate <THCBIR=ECI> in a back-to-back cut this year.  \n The rate cut was the fourth since August. Friday's special meeting was the first time since 2003.  \n \"This will mitigate the impact on the economy and also reinforce fiscal measures already implemented and forthcoming,\" the BOT said in a statement.  \n That will also reduce the burden of interest on borrowers affected by the coronavirus outbreak and alleviate strains on liquidity in the financial markets, it said.  \n \"The committee viewed that the COVID-19 outbreak in the period ahead would be more severe than previously expected and the situation would take some time before returning to normal. This would severely affect the Thai economy,\" it added.  \n The pandemic has roiled global financial markets, affecting liquidity and the functioning of Thai financial markets despite the overall stability of the financial system, it said.  \n The rate cut suggests the MPC is accepting that the Thai economy is entering a recession along with the global economy, said Amonthep Chawla, an economist at CIMB Thai.  \n (GRAPHIC: Thai GDP and regional peers - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2187/2155/Thai%20GDP%20VS%20regional%20peers.png)  \n Central banks around the world have slashed interest rates in the past few weeks and provided additional stimulus in some cases to try to help alleviate the threat to the global economy from the coronavirus pandemic.  \n Thailand on Friday reported 50 new coronavirus infections, taking its tally to 322. One person has died.  \n \"We now see two further policy rate cuts of 25 bps each in Q2 and Q3, taking the rate to a record-low 0.25% at end-2020,\" said Tim Leelahaphan, an economist at Standard Chartered.  \n \"Policy space is running out, and alternatives have not been communicated,\" he said.  \n The MPC will still meet to review policy on March 25, as scheduled, when it will also offer updated economic forecasts.  \n It is expected to slash its 2020 growth forecast from 2.8%.

Drugmakers racing to find a vaccine or effective treatment for the deadly new coronavirus in China cautioned that they have a long way to go.  \n That runs counter to reports of a supposed \"breakthrough\" that on Wednesday boosted financial markets and spurred optimism not necessarily backed by reality.  \n At least a dozen drugmakers are working on vaccines or antivirals and other treatments to help those infected with the fast-spreading contagion.  \n Investment costs for vaccines could run as high as $800 million in a process that, even if accelerated, will likely take more than a year until approval, according to executives from companies involved in the effort.  \n \"It will take at least 12 to 18 months, which means in the acute situation we are in now - at least in China - that will not create a benefit,\" said Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GlaxoSmithKline's <GSK.L> vaccine unit. GSK is working with developers by providing a technology that could make their vaccines more potent.  \n The virus, which emerged in December in China, has killed nearly 500 people and shows no sign of abating, with thousands of new cases reported each day, mostly in central China's Hubei province. But its spread to some 27 countries and regions has caused global alarm.  \n To be sure, companies developing treatments for patients who are already sick may be able to get a drug approved faster than a vaccine that would be given to healthy people. Even so, logistical and regulatory challenges remain, according to two executives at Gilead Sciences Inc <GILD.O>, which is working on an experimental antiviral treatment.  \n \"There is a distinction there between a therapeutic and a vaccine. Having said that, I think it is true that this won't be super fast and it will involve us investing at risk right now,\" said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey.  \n Clinical trials for treatments can be smaller and of shorter duration than for vaccines, Parsey acknowledged.  \n Challenges in making sure therapies are effective and then scaling up production still remain. Gilead has only a limited supply of its remdesivir, which will be tested against the coronavirus after previously failing in trials as a treatment for Ebola.  \n  \n 'LOOKING FOR A MAGIC BULLET'  \n Dr. Thomas Frieden, who was director of the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention during the also deadly MERS outbreak, said the benefit of antiviral treatments for such emergencies in the past has been modest.  \n What worked with MERS and SARS, for example, was better infection control in healthcare facilities, he said of two other types of coronaviruses that also caused global alarm.  \n \"It doesn't mean we shouldn't try, but we're often looking for a magic bullet and the bright shiny object. Sometimes we need to just have the basics,\" Frieden said.  \n A Chinese TV report on Wednesday said that a research team at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus, while researchers in the UK told Sky News separately they had made a \"significant breakthrough\" in finding a vaccine.  \n Reuters could not independently verify the reports, but several traders cited them for sharp upticks in global stock markets.  \n \"There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV,\" said World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, using the current designation for the new coronavirus, when asked about reports of \"drug breakthroughs.\"  \n Health officials in the United States and China have set ambitious goals for getting a vaccine to initial human testing within the next few months.  \n Newer vaccine platforms, such as one developed by Moderna Inc <MRNA.O>, allow scientists to create a potential vaccine in record time just based on knowing the genetic code of the novel coronavirus. With the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development without needing a sample of the virus.  \n Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is using Moderna's platform, said the agency is on the fastest pace ever to develop a vaccine candidate.  \n He hopes to have a vaccine available for initial safety testing within two and a half to three months from the time scientists determined the genetic sequence of the virus.  \n Novavax Inc <NVAX.O> research chief Gregory Glenn told Reuters his company has taken vaccines from discovery to clinical testing in 90 days and believes it could do something similar for the new coronavirus.  \n But to move vaccine candidates from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles, according to health experts and executives for drugmakers working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments.  \n In addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks, there are regulatory hurdles such as conducting large clinical trials to make sure a vaccine not only confers immunity to the virus but is safe for use in the general population.  \n \"The earliest you could even know if it's going to work is a year,\" Fauci said.  \n Whether even a highly effective vaccine will prove profitable for companies is another big question.  \n \"The outbreak could be abating by the time a vaccine is deemed safe,\" Karen Andersen, who follows biotech companies for Morningstar, said in a research note.  \n The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has raised around $800 million from donors to aid in preventing pandemic diseases and has allocated some of those funds to biotechs, including Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc <INO.O>, Moderna Inc <MRNA.O> and CureVac, which are working on coronavirus vaccines.  \n \"We stepped into this with no economic expectation,\" said Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson's <JNJ.N> chief scientific officer. \"We'll see whether in the end it gives a reward.\" REUTERS \n "}, {"content": "Liga e Sindicato de Jogadores criam comissão de acompanhamento à pandemia do coronavírus.
